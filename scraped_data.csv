"We were very impressed by entering the Hotel, unfortunately this changed when we had a bottle of Wine in the bar. There was no service for about 45 minutes, we were ignored, even if we complained once.  We had to pour in the wine ourselves and the staff always passed us, but did not ask if everything was okay. Then we complained again and asked for a manager. Nothing happend.  We had to tell the staff 4 times that we would like to pay and finally the check arrived.  On our way out the Resident Manager showed up and apologized for everything, very kind and professional...we thought.  He asked us to contact him and send a note to him and he would talk care of a refund. We did so but nothing happend, there was no response to us..again.  Therefore it shows from the staff up to the",1,1
"In corridors for hours sitting people who strangly watch customers entering hotel. The hotel is dark, breakfast is of poor quality. Belboy at the entrance asking guest about their nationality. Cosmetis old , not those which should be according new concept. No access to films for children(pay tv). Better choose another hotel.",1,1
"Beautiful property with great location.  Modern with the best technical equipment. Return after 3 years , unfortunately a huge dissapointment. Luck of staff, care for details, care for customer. No proper cleaning of the room, an attempt  to add extra charges for breakfast by employee. Some staff pretend not see you or look away when passing you in the lobby. Even a problem to arrange a taxi from the hotel. It is obvious that the brand Peninsula has abandoned hotel in Paris. Peninsula is withering like the flowers in its windows. We will not return.",2,1
"We stayed at the Peninsula December 31-January 5. We booked through Amex Fine hotels and resorts. From experience at other luxury hotels I would Say this Hotel was mediocre. Pros: The hotel itself is beautiful. the hotel lobby, dining areas, and bars are just lovely. The Receptionist were very nice and always attentive. The room was large and spacious. The breakfast was always very good and lots of options. we tried them all. the restaurants  in the hotel all were top quality and very good food. the complimentary car service when available was nice as well. Cons: the concierge were just horrible. I would say because of the concierge alone I would NOT stay again without some sort of compensation. Mostly, Some members either would not do what you ask because they said it was not",2,1
I was in Paris for one day for business. And I booked at the peninsula Paris. I was on a very tight schedule. I arrived a head of the check in time in about 2 hours  and I scheduled   Everything accordingly But what I didn't plan for was the extra 2 hours delay!!  I was exhausted. And I had appointments to attend. When I inquired at the  front desk about  when can I check in and if my room was ready they said in about 15-min. 15-min turned in to 2 hours !! The staff was  completely inattentive and unprofessional!completly! Due to this delay I had to reschduelle my appointmnts and extend my stay in Paris for couple of days. I checked out first thing in the morning and changed the hotel .Very terrible. Experience.,1,1
"On a recent visit to The Peninsula, me and my party wanted to enjoy a cocktail on the rooftop bar. The downstairs staff was rude, and the staff on the rooftop were worse. We were speaking English and maybe they just assumed we were Americans. We are not. We were a party of 3 woman, 1 from Germany, 1 from Scotland and myself from Milan. They gave us grief about going up in the elevator to the bar (my friend had 700 Euro velvet Prada sport shoes on. They apparently were not nice enough. We had to return the next day with nicer shoes on! When we were finally let up to the rooftop bar, not only was the staff rude, the tables were not clean. The restroom was not clean. And the drink I ordered was definitely not the top shelve drink that was promised. We ended up leaving and going to",1,1
"Mixed race (Chinese and Caucasian) couple arrived at the hotel in t-shirts but tidily dressed.  We were literally blocked by the doorman who refused to let us enter, demanded to know why we were there and wanted to search our bags.  After finally reaching check-in and reporting this to the hotel, the front desk staff apologised and he was removed from the door shortly afterwards.  We thought that was the end of the clearly hostile treatment ... it wasn't.  That evening we went up to the restaurant (which was recommended by the front desk) at 10pm to get dessert (after a meal outside the hotel).  Once again tidily dressed, we were again intercepted, this time by the restaurant doorman who responded ""no"" when we asked what time the restaurant closed.  When questioned he repeated",1,1
"The hotel is beautiful.  However, service is a major disappointment and not up to 5 star standards. We stayed at Claridges in London which is a world of difference.  At the Peninsula, maid service missed cleaning and turndown several times, plates left in our room for days, toiletries and soap not replaced, doorman rarely was present to open front doors for the ladies, room was not ready in time.  When we returned the first evening, they could not find our keys.  Our bags were still at bellhop and were not delivered to rooms promptly.  Concierge was helpful but relatively ordinary, nothing great.   No personal care, you feel like just a number in a big hotel not truly like a guest.  Never offered the house cars at all.    On the plus side, the rooms are very nice.  We had two",2,1
"Overall the at this Peninsula is NOT to the standard.  I have stayed at the HK, Bangkok and Chicago Peninsula; several times. The worst of all was the e122 for terrible breakfast. I don’t mind paying for quality. But this much money for what we got and then it was not only bad service but the food choices were confusing and very limited and the service was very slow.  Not to mention that they had the door to the patio open and flys were landing all over the fruit presentation.  I told the staff several times but they seen not interested.",1,1
"Pros: Spacious room, understated taste of decor, and daily fruit platter. The rooftop bar is a fabulous spot for a great view of the Eiffel Tower. Civilized hotel staff.  My photos are flattering I know.   Cons: The Peninsula Paris boasts of its techs, but to my dismay, some malfunction in critical moments.  The printer/fax machine in my superior room (214) crashed the evening before my check-out and the tech department could hardly fix the mayhem after sending two engineers and messed up the studio. Fortunately, the laser printers in Business Center did function and the crisis resolved. Our dinner was thus delayed and the evening ruined.  WiFi initially did not work on one mobile device shortly after check-in, and an engineer was sent for 90 mins later. The connecting issue",2,1
"I stayed here at the start of this year and really enjoyed it.  However, I have just spent longer there and the service and staff were consistently bad.  Front desk staff who couldn’t even sort out my bill (basic) very quickly.  Also, I don’t particularly 4 staff “hanging around” in the spa while I use the gym (I was the only person in there).  But then they couldn’t make my room up when requested, nor bring the simplest of breakfasts in under 30 mins.  I will not be going back.",2,1
"Come to Paris join the chanel Haute couture show 18/19. I booked the peninsula Paris for 3 nights through Amex centurion service. the hotel location is good and the room is clean. I tried the roof top restaurant, the food and the servce is good as well. However, the concierge service of the hotel is much below expectations. I asked the lady name Vanessa from concierge to inform me when they receive the chanel show invitation card. However, the concierge totally forgot to inform me that they have received the stuff from Chanel. As a five star luxury hotel, I don’t think this poor service is acceptable. I feel that the hotel concierges is very messy.",1,1
It’s a beautiful hotel don’t get me wrong however for the price you pay you definitely do NOT get the service you deserve. Go to Four Seasons George V or Plaza Athenee instead. Some staff just seem like they can’t be bothered. But what really ticked me off was the doormen/bellboys seeing me get out of the car with paper bags and in need of help but they turned to continue talking to one another.,1,1
"I had a slew of mishaps at this hotel but I don't think it would have happened to everyone so I am not going to make a long post of what happened. In any case for this price point I was expecting to be wowed but I was not and on top of that I had mishaps that should never happen at a high end hotel like this or any hotel for that matter. Just one small example was I called reception and no one picked up. Finally I reached an operator who said reception was busy and would call me back...30 mins later no one returned my call so I called back. After having my matter handled by reception I asked for some packing material. Instead of taking care of it or even transferring me, they asked me to call concierge myself, mind blown. The bigger matters were quite ridiculous, for example our",2,1
Amazing hotel in a quiet neighborhood however the service was spotty and sometimes hostile and rude  I really wanted to give this hotel a higher rating but the hostile attitudes of some staff members prevented that- particularly as the hotel charges ultra premium rates and should therefore provide corresponding service  Pros +amazing room with top notch in-room interior design and layout  +great doormen and service staff  +concierge is very helpful however still cannot get a reservation at any restaurant- which is disappointing since one would expect this   +former conference center for the French government (however has been renovated)  +amazing rooftop view of the Eiffel Tower  +breakfast at the Peninsula is the place to be seen!  +10-15 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower and 5,2,1
"Where to start? We stayed here from June the 1st to June the 5th 2015. It was the end of our honeymoon and we were so excited to be staying at The Peninsula in Paris, considering is the most expensive hotel in the city we had huge expectations. Cant complain of the installations because the interiors are spectacular, the rooms are nice and the food is pretty good. We were in love and happy with the selection of the hotel, until we GOT STOLEN FROM OUR ROOM.   We thought we had put all the valuable things on the safety box, but remembered we had each one a gold chain on our personal bags.On the pocket of my big travel bag (which remained on the room chair during the whole stay. I wasn’t using it while around Paris) it was hidden a GOLD/DIAMOND ‘CARTIER’ LOVE CHAIN  and on my",1,1
"We have stayed in many Peninsula resorts, and have never had such a horrible experience as we did during our 10 day stay at the Peninsula Paris.  Let me start by saying the hotel itself is beautiful--but that's where the magic ended. From the first day we checked in, we had issues with our keys. One hour they would work and the next they wouldn't--this is maddening since you need your key to access the elevators. Many complaints, but it was never completely fixed.   They had a complete disregard for our special requests (which you pay a hefty price for)--we were celebrating a birthday and ordered flowers to be delivered to the room morning of.... they didn't show up until nearly 9:00 that evening, and only after we inquired where they were. We also ordered a plain white cake for",1,1
"While Peninsula Paris has an amazing, detailed buildout, staying there was an awkward, soulless experience that I wouldn’t want to repeat. In many senses, there is a mausoleum-like atmosphere of cavernous public spaces and minimalist style rooms that felt both high-end and antiseptic at the same time.  Despite the hotel being brand new, unfortunately the furniture in my room was already falling apart (see picture), and I have never seen a brand new bathroom vanity so stained (see picture). The water pressure is inadequate to have a great shower, and the lobby restaurant was so warm and fetid (and generally empty) as to be distinctly unpleasant. The staff suggested after-work drinks in the rooftop l’Oiseau Blanc for drinks with a beautiful view over Paris, but we were seated in a",2,1
"Touted as a 800m Euros hotel !  Appeared to look grand, but on closer look, the details are very poor and with cheap substitutes.  In one of the lobbies, they used concrete wall painted with white lines instead of real lime stones, uses faux pas column instead of real marble. The chandeliers looks really flimsy and cheap, and the Chinese restaurant is so theatrically cheap looking too. It does not befit the great name of Peninsula Hotels.  What a let down.",1,1
We had made a reservation at the Peninsula Paris which went fine through the website. We then tried to make several restaurant reservations in the hotel. We were connected to the restaurants but no one picked up the phone. We then spoke with front desk and we were put on music hold for at least fifteen minutes. We then resorted to make a reservation by email. This was Thursday for a Tuesday night reservation. No reply. By Monday we canceled our hotel reservation to the Mandarin Oriental. Upon inquiring why we had cancelled our reservation we politely expressed our disappointment with their attention. We received an email that this was their standard service level.   Ouch...  I am sure the management of this excellent hotel chain will make the necessary adjustment to bring the,1,1
"I recently stayed in this hotel during Sptember 2014 after reading all the positive reviews on trip-advisor.  One word...HORRIBLE..!  It is admirable only outside.  The service I received was rude corresponding.  First of all,  It takes 90 minutes to check in at the lobby.  Reason is that with because there was a late check-out.   What also does not correspond to an electrical problem in the room.  Electricity did not work in the room.  They told me the technician will come on the phone, but it came after all it was two days later.   Room service(In room dining) will not come on time that I expected time.  I was kept waiting for a long time.(45minutes). We have finally got it reminds.  However staff that was brought was spilled drink. He forgot also butter and jam.  I did not",1,1
"The building is a landmark, amazing, and the multimillion USD renovation has transformed this old conference center into an masterpiece building. BUT: no soul, empty lobby, a terrible corridor with low quality brand shops, it looks like we are in a trainstation...   AND a service that is just...surprising. Front desk was supposed to let us visit different rooms. We waited 30 minutes in the lobby, after having been told by the night director that we would visit the rooms. 30' later, someone came saying unapolegetically ""the hotel is 100% booked, we cannot let you visit"". After having spent 2000 USD at the restaurant and waited 30m, I was expecting more. Wont come back.",1,1
"I stayed at this hotel in November 2018. Not suitable for international traveler.  Check in: Arrived late in the evening to check in but the receptionist showed no courtesy or tried to be friendly at all. So, first impression was below average.  Room: There was stain on the sheets. No shower curtains so the floor was just wet everytime after a shower. Couldn't turn on the AC and the hotel was just roasting me. Next morning, I tried to ask for a room with at least shower curtain... Unsurprisingly, they do not have one. The only redeeming point is the friendliness of the day night receptionist.  Breakfast: Food was mediocre. Couldn't even bother to label what type of meat were the charcuterie.  Overall, wouldn't recommend this hotel. Given the experience, would rather pay more for",1,1
"The only thing 4 stars in this hotel was Gerome. Otherwise very nonplussed! Our first room was overcrowded and on the street side...too loud. I told Gerome that evening that we were very disappointed, he said he would leave a note for staff to change our room. Second room much better but still nothing to brag about. Beds very hard, pillows just okay. Bathroom is clean. They talk about an open bar it is soft drinks and a few snack items.  Gerome was only person to help overnight at the front desk. He tried very hard to be helpful to a lot of guests who had a lot of requests while I was in lobby Area.",2,1
"It first started with our arrival.  We arrived pretty early, 10:30 am so I knew we were definitely not going to get to check in, however we were hopeful.  We were told that our room was still occupied, check out time is 12:00, and that we would have the room at 2:00.  At about 1:00pm, we were told that our room was still occupied and that we would not get the room till 4:00.  At that point we were very tired from over a 24 hour international travel that we were beyond exhausted and frustrated.  The hotel allowed the current guests to stay in our room 2 hours past check out time.  Why would they do that knowing that they had the new guests waiting.  They did finally give us a very very tiny temporary room for 3 adults and my baby for us to wait in for 1-2 hours.  They originally",2,1
"There is NO air conditioning in the rooms, so this means it's horribly hot !! This is very uncomfortable and hot.   To make matters even worse the beds are 2 single beds pushed together,  they keep moving apart during the night.   I had to open the window for airflow and the road noise was soo loud , cars people etc kept me wake until 2am. (If you get a road facing room it's game over).   I didn't sleep well , this affected my daytime activity.   There is no headboard and the doors SLAM constantly because they have automatic door closers (instead of soft close). This is NOT a minor issue it wakes you up past midnight as some guests are out late.   AVOID.   AVOID.",1,1
One of the rare occasions I have been let down by Trip Advisor. I am reviewing this realisticaly as a 3 star hotel. The longer I stayed the lower the rating went. It has some major failings that dictate a zero star rating.  Cigarette smoke is coming into the room via the airconditioning system. Easy to test as you can turn off the airconditioning to the room and voila no smoke smell. This alone is sufficent for a zero rating.  The room doors close with great force. They do not bang loudly but close with so much force that a wave of low intensity noise rolls across the flloor. If their are some late returning inconsiderate guests then you will not sleep until the last one returns.  The rooms are not soundproofed as claimed. The windows are double glazed but it is thermal glazing.,1,1
"I don’t know why this hotel is rated so high on TripAdvisor.  The only good thing about this hotel is its location. It’s close to many nice restaurants, and it’s close to two different metro stations but that’s not really a plus in Paris. Most hotels are located within 5-10 min walk of a metro station.   The facilities are pretty mediocre compared to similarly priced hotels. There are no central air ducts so the rooms are pretty stuffy even during winter. We resorted to opening the windows but our room happened to be next to an outdoor glass elevator so people riding the elevator could literally look into your room, not to mention the noisy sounds from the elevator throughout the night.  Housekeeping also never refilled our shampoo and other toiletries.  But the truly bad thing",1,1
"We arrived around noon and while checking in we discovered that unfortunately the hotel suffered from the gas line explosion in Paris and has no hot water. They were out of hot water a few days prior to our arrival but made no effort to notify us in advance. They suggested we either stay and shower at a nearby hotel or move to another hotel. When we insisted on a hotel that has equivalent or higher rating, they literally yelled at us and said that we can leave if we don’t like what they are offering. Since the hotel manager assured us that hot water will be available the next day and we were traveling with two kids that were hungry and tired, we desided we will stay at the hotel. I must add that the hotel IS very nice, clean and modern. The rooms are specious and the amenities",2,1
"The hotel is in a good location regarding restaurants and the Louvre is within walking distance. The room has no drawers for your clothes, just a couple of shelves. The room was incredibly small. It was nice to have a beverage available in the room. The breakfast was good. I had a problem of smokers who smoke came through the vent, causing irritation to my throat and nose, making me cough. I went downstairs and all he says “it’s a nonsmoking hotel”. People apparently didn’t want to go outside to smoke. Also, do not disturb is not honored.she came in my room twice in spite of the sign on door.",2,1
If you are American some of the front desk personnel are very rude to us except for one or two. Mostly everywhere you visit in Paris people are rude to Americans. Try a different country. The rooms are very small but they look big on picture. The only plus is the free snack and the 8 dollar breakfast,1,1
"Be aware that they turn off the AC during the colder season (Fall-Winter) so its only warm air or no ventilation at all bec its at centralized system, this is what they say at least it maybe a lie. Anyway, your only option to get cool air coming in is opening your window. However, it’s very loud outside bec of traffic, sirens wailing, etc. so good luck sleeping at night. You can compromise I guess by purchasing ear plugs but you really shouldn’t. The least they could provide are ear plugs but they won’t. So when the room is vacated during the day and all the window are closed, it goes up to 26C or 78.8F (they said it themselves when I pressed on the question). AC or heating should be based on each rooms and the guests preference, NOT one size fits all type. If I’d known this",2,1
"After such great reviews I guess we had high expectations, however these were unmet and we departed early. Small quarters humid and uncomfortable in warmer and wet weather. Breakfast was sufficient however we decided we preferred to eat in bakeries/cafes for that Parisienne feel.",2,1
"I was packing in a hurry and I mistakenly took my leftover British Pounds from the safe box and put them in my backpack before leaving the luggage with the hotel - a total of 2 large suitcases and 2 business style backpacks. We returned 3 hours later, again in a hurry, took the luggage and left with a cab. Upon our arrival in another city around 23:00, I checked the contents of my bag and I found out all of my approximately 600 GBP and some other small money is missing. I immediately called the hotel, the guy said he can't do anything and they have no cameras. He said he will speak to the manager and call me in the morning. I didn't get a call in the morning so I called after lunch. Spoke to a woman (manager) who was ""just about to call me"" and she accused me of lying, stating",1,1
"This review was tough to write, because on first glance, the room is exquisite. We upgraded to a superior double and were given a corner room facing the street. We had a beautiful balcony, three giant floor to ceiling windows and loved spending time on our balcony just people watching and enjoying a glass of wine. The bed was comfortable and the room was spacious and clean (upon first glance). The bathroom was nice but because there was only a half a door on the shower, a lot of water got onto the floor. The free mini bar was awesome and the breakfast was absolutely delicious (try the potatoes, they are amazing)! Now, all of this was great but there was one big problem. There were so many moths it was disgusting. At first, we thought they had come in when we had one of the",2,1
"Because of the jet lag, I was awake from 3 am Paris time, but there is no kettle or any facility to get any water in the room. So I went to the breakfast area at around 6:45. Seeing that there is some juice available in the breakfast area and I am really thirsty, I help my self to a glass of orange juice and sit in the breakfast area to await the breakfast opening at 7 am. Then an african french waitress who is getting food out of the kitchen shouted to me far away that the breakfast is only open at 7 am. treating me as if I am a criminal. The hotel should provide some kettle in the room so that I could at least have some warm water to drink in such a cold winter day.Disappointed with the service and will  not return.",1,1
The trip to Paris was a dream for us.Everything was good with the services of the hotel until 10 minutes before we go.We put our bag in the living room of the hotel and we went to  reception to take our suitcases.During this time  our bag was stolen .We searched everywhere and we asked to see the footage from the surveillance cameras of the hotel in order to see if the thief was one of the staff or another person.They told us that the hotel doesn't have any cameras at all .At the same time our taxi was waiting outside and we couldn't do anything more because we were going to miss our flight so we left without our bag.During our way to the airport we called the intendancy of the hotel and they were very offensive.They denied that the situation really happened in the hotel.Our,2,1
"This could be a great hotel, and much of customer service was quite good, BUT the incidents where customer service was lacking really impacted my experience. To make your stay better than mine, here is some advice: be sure that your room is not on the 6th floor. The elevator ends on the 5th floor. To reach the 6th floor you have to carry your luggage up a narrow, iron stairway. We had no idea about this when we booked our room. Additionally, it would have been nice (and professional) if the hotel had arranged to deposit our luggage upstairs when our room became available, or offered to have someone help with our luggage when we checked in.  Next, the hotel offers a car service to the airport with the option to pay by credit card. I arranged for a car, and checked about the",2,1
I am not sure why their are so many good reviews for this hotel.  My husband and I just finished staying here for 4 nights and we were not impressed with this hotel at all. The rooms are very small and yes this is Paris but I have been to Paris 3 times and stayed in much better hotels than this one.  The included breakfast is terrible.  They serve scrambled eggs in the morning which had an awful slimy texture.  I noticed them filling up the eggs one morning from a plastic box that they had microwaved.  These are not fresh made scrambled eggs which you would expect in Paris but premade eggs shipped to the hotel already done.  The pastries all tasted at least 1-2 days old.  Not what you expect from Paris.  The fruit salad in the morning was not edible.  It also came premade and,2,1
"Currently staying at hotel 34b for four nights during our stay at Paris.   Unclear as to how its possible this hotel has such good reviews on trip advisor. The front desk was minimally helpful with any suggestions that were asked. Noise level ridiculous at night. Our room was facing the street and the street is popular for going out. ""Breakfast"" and ""happy hour"" free but barebones. Do not expect additional services or anyone to go above and beyond in anyway.  The pros were the price (we upgraded to the superior room) and location is somewhat central. Wifi available in the rooms. Overall would not recommend or plan on returning.",2,1

We were here for 4 nights. We couldn't sleep for 3 of the nights due to a broken air con. Day one we noticed the air con wasn't working in the room. Early next morning we mentioned to the front desk. The guy said the air con was broken and not sure when the technician was coming in to fix it. Day two afternoon we asked the front desk if the air con was fixed because it's hot in the room. The response was that it was normal temperature in Europe so no air con needed and so we figured maybe this hotel doesn't have cooling air con. It was difficult to sleep at night because there's no air flow and opening the windows exposed us to the noise on the street. So day three we asked whether they could at least configure the air con to deliver some air flow. At first the guy on the front,2,1

The room was right under roof and a part of the room was not useable due lack of space between floor&roof (it was less than 160cm). The shower and WC was in two separate rooms and after using WC you must go from WC to ""living-room"" for coming to shower for washing your hands! This is not so pleasant for going from WC with not washed hands.  The expresso machine in the room was also broken and of course they fixed it after I notice hotel staff.

We booked a double room, and received a confirmation e-mail clearly stating we booked a double room indeed... So far so good... However, during the booking, something went wrong, and the hotel thought we would come with 1 person only instead of 2, so the hotel decided to give us a single room (again, even though the mail clearly states we booked a double room).

I also had a bad personal experience of losing my laptop the last day I was there. It was a customized new MacBook Pro and apart from its cost, I had many important data on it. The hotel staff did as little as possible to help me find my laptop. I asked them to check their CCTV to see if I had the laptop with me when I left the hotel and this was less than a week after I had checked out. They told me they only keep the CCTV records for 24 hours!! This is to me a lie that defy the purpose of having a CCTV. I can",2,1

I also sent a follow up email requesting the same, but when we arrived we found out the room category we reserved does not have adjoining rooms.  I don't understand why that was not explained to us once we made the reservation. The only response we received via email to our requests was that they would do their best to accommodate, but never mentioned it was not a possibility.

"great position, nice rooms, if a little tired. good breakfast,  though second morning spoilt  by incessant fire alarm. poor approach to the asking of feedback on here has lead to a tainted visit and a poor review. Will be in two minds about returning. this is a shame.",2,1
"the front desk staff was helpful and accomadating. The location is ideal. However, there was construction and someone, housekeeping or construction, entered our room to steal. It's strange because they took petty items and went through our bags. My husband's umbrella was taken, and my headphones. We had a lot of cash and two IPads along with a few other items that were not touched. Unfortunately, the manager totally disregarded our complaint and refused to talk or meet. The front desk tried to help by asking the housekeeper if she remembered  the headphones, etc. but she said no. My husband's headphone set was visible, which the housekeeper said she saw but didn't touch...not as nice as my set.  Basically, unacceptable to enter guest rooms, go through their bags, steal, and",2,1
"Very small rooms. The hotel reeks of wood paint smell. The lift is scary  and only reaches to the 5th floor.  The breakfast area is also very small and always full.   The bathroom is missing some essentials like toothbrush, shaving blade.  When i asked for a travelers adapter. The receptionist told me "" come and get it from the reception""",2,1
Stayed for a quick one night business trip.  Having asked for a high up quiet roo hi rat room I was allocated was on the ground floor at pavement level. I asked to change and staff quickly moved me . The room was what I call functional. Furnishings felt cheap and bathroom was smallest I have ever been in -impossible to turn the shower on without leaning fully under it . The hotel is a conversation in an old apartment block and accordingly lots of noise from overhead rooms and in corridors . Some nice touches like free non-alcoholic drinks in the room.  A sheek and slightly funky feel to the lounge and dining room downstairs and the staff were very pleasant and helpful -not always the way in Paris. So an ok place in a good location .,2,1
"Really disappointed hotel and an awful high price.I stayed 3night at this hotel with my Gf in Feb 2014 ( valentines day ).we were really surprise for first time visit of Paris by this hotel!!! First of all, I have to say, the rudest reception I'v ever seen in the whole world in 4 star hotel.staff are very rude and inattentive, I have arrived in the hotel at 12 o' clock and I asked them if possible could you help me to give us our room earlier, and no body answer me.after many time request, they told us Never ever because our rooms are full!!!!!!!

"I booked this hotel through Hotels.com for from 3/28/14 through 4/7/14. First of all, I can say that by far this is not a 4 star hotel. Very understaffed, dirty, and even though they claimed hotel being non smoking, my room had unbearable cigarette smoke and burned cigarette butts by the window. It looked like no one even bothered property clean the room. Carpets were dirty, service was very poor. I was locked at the rate through Hotels.com but hotel charged me an extra 750 EU upon my departure claiming they rollaway bed was not fee, even though on the website and at the time of my booking it was clearly stating that there was NO CHARGE for it.

Nobody replace the minibar, that was even more dirty than the room during my 3 days stay. Breakfast is a joke... buffet? Absolutely fake! One guy, I supposed he must be the service, expend all of his time to chat with spanish guests while we were waiting to been served. Nothing to eat, no croissants, no toast... because they have ""a problem with the stock and the delivery"", one more time, when I was asking for help at reception, a receptionist called Victoria just ignored me and told me that breakfast is not her business!!!

"On arriving at the hotel on the 22 Sept we requested a porter to assist with the luggage  I had my sickly mother and a child with me. Was told they do not offer this service even though their customer service brochure in the rooms says that they do. Also, noticed a porter assisting visitors with their bags. Hotel rooms were not cleaned just beds made up until I complained. 2nd last day my mum was in the room while it was being cleaned and she noticed that the drinking glasses were washed in the bathroom and dried with the bath sheets on the floor which we used. Handed my laundry in on Saturday morning and was promised to have it by 20:00 latest 21:00. It is now Sunday 16:30 and have not received laundry back.

"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in June 2013. We were a couple and a 2 years old child. We had booked it through a travel agent and everything was paid for before hand. We reached the hotel around 1pm and were told that the check in time is 2pm and the room would be ready by 2. We agreed to wait for an hour but the room wasn't ready by even 3pm. The reason they gave us for the delay was that the baby bed is taking time to be ready. Only after we protested a bit, we were given a room that too without a baby bed, which was put later on.......in spite of the fact that we had already booked and paid for the room. We got a room on the first floor.The room was very small and very noisy from 6am. The wi fi is not very good. The speed is very slow and the network is inconsistent.",2,1

They claim to have a free high speed internet connection, which is the Basic Business package. This package sees 50KB/s max which is like an edge connection. You are lucky if you get your connection up for 5 minutes; dns fails all the time.   Anyway, I got fed up and bought the paid business package which is 17Eu per day. And my speed went up to 100KB/s which is like a joke. Just to browse web pages takes ages, how am I supposed to send out and get emails. Also the connection (not the wi-fi connection) drops every 5 minutes so you have to switch off your wi-fi and then again on to initiate your connection. Yesterday I had no connection at all.

"Booking this hotel was the worst decision ever made and has definitely spoilt our first 2 nights in Paris.   Upon arrival, we were informed by front desk that our booking for which full payment was made in advance cannot be found. Was asked to make a fresh booking and of course make payment again for the room. We objected to it as we have already made full payment in advance and requested the front desk to check again. But we were taken aback when the front desk rudely shouted at us to sit at the side and that she doesn't want to talk to us. Finally the front desk managed to find our booking and checked in for us with no apology offered for the blunder of not being able to find our booking and the shouting episode earlier. This is totally unacceptable of any hotel in any part of",1,1
"We stayed from Saturday March 30th till Monday April 1st (Easter weekend). The hotel is ok. I have had better, I have had worse hotels in Paris. Breakfast was terrible on Sunday morning (no space, dirty tables, no food, no staff,  etc etc), but it was very nice on Monday morning. That says it all.  We stayed in room 21 and 25. The rooms were rather hot, but because off the weather that was no problem....  The big issue are the vehicles slowly passing the hotel between 02.00 en 04.00 o’clock in the night  that are blaring deafening music. The air can literally shake. Because they are creating traffic jams, there is also a lot off honking and shouting. The first night we were joking about Easter Races (it is a tradition in Holland during the Easter Holidays during the day). So at",1,1
I stayed here with my boyfriend. The staff was nice and the room was nice and cozy. The sneakers I arrived to the hotel with were stolen from my room and management said they would check on it and I never heard back. I told them what sneakers they were and color and al management said was that “they weren’t in the room” obviously they aren’t in the room because the cleaning crew took them. Never staying here again! Don’t stay here unless you want your things stolen.,1,1
"Decent hotel location, rooms are old. All our electrical outlets didn’t function on the 2nd day. Man at the front desk wasn’t apologetic about it and expressed there’s nothing they can do. They wouldn’t transfer us to another room. All they offered was to use the electrical outlets at the reception. Such a hassle. No compensation was given.  Redeeming factor was the Cafe Staff are wonderful! Tej, Arleen, Merly really took exceptional care of us.",2,1
"The room was smaller than the stateroom on the ship we had just left. The furnishings consisted of a desk, a desk chair and a felt cube, which were the cheapest Ikea sells. There wasn't even a headboard on the bed which was hard as a rock. We had to take Tylenol PM to sleep. The closet was a small indentation in the room so shallow the hangers hung at an angle. The storage consisted of small crude shelves. There weren't any towel bars in the bathroom and no place to put your toiletries since the towels were balanced on the small shelf behind the toilet. The towels were of poor quality in keeping with everything else in the room. The breakfast was adequate but not very good quality, I watched a man stand at the buffet and eat dates & prunes directly from the serving bowl with his",2,1
Female staff is friendly and helpful the gentlemen there not so much.  He's actually kind of rude. The outside looks ok but when I walked in it was not what I was expecting.  It looks old & The rooms are extremely small.  Our king size bed was just two beds pushed together that kept separating.  We had a lot of moths flying around and the bathroom only has a sink so no where to really put your stuff.  the bathtub is old with nothing to keep the water from running on the floor while taking a shower.  Also they do not have small towns so you will need to bring your own if you use small wash clothes to bath.  When we got ready to leave the elevator was broken so we had to carry all of our heavy luggage down all those flights of very old and unsafe stairs.  the rooms do NOT look as,2,1
"Very small horrible room. Smaller then closet.  Free minibar, that's true. Cola and couple of bottles of water.  Free open bar. Cola, tea, juice from concentrates. Some snacks.  Breakfast is horrible. Bad coffee, no vegetables at all.  Elevator was on service.  I can recommend this hotel only if you need bed and nothing else.  Price is not very reasonable for a such low quality.",1,1
"Please reconsider booking this hotel. Reason is a simple  answered by a simple question. Why do people book hotels mainly? Sleep and possible eating. With that being said, Most people bath in the morning and night or both. First item was the bathtub was clogged. Nice thing to be faced with right off the bat. Well that was fixed, and ready for a nice sleep. Wrongggggggg!!!!! Beds are Queen Sized Beds? How about two Regular Beds put together. Mattresses are Foam and excellent for light kids. Anyone over the weight of 60 pounds you will leave a crevice the size of Grand Canyon. If anyones considering booking this hotel who has a sensitive back look elsewhere. Thats the reason we gave two green dots. The front desk staff were fantastic. Always a smile on their faces. Willing to",2,1
"It's almost as if they squeezed as many rooms as they could into this building without any regard to normal space requirements.  The shower was so tiny that the shower curtain was sticking to my rear end while I was showering.  I constantly bumped into the knob and the water would stop.  I also hit my head against the shower wall when I dropped the soap and bent down to pick it up.  If you unpack your small carry-on bag next to the bed, you will find you can no longer walk around the bed.  The WiFi in the hotel worked OK. The breakfast was one of the best ones we had on our trip.  All of the windows in the rooms all face the same center area.  So the only view you have is of the other guests rooms.  The staircase to the second floor is a deathtrap, It has short landings and tall",2,1
"I spent 3 nights at this hotel in May 2014.  The room was incredibly small, you could barely get around the bed.  The view from the room was of a dismal alley.  The bathtub was stopped up and when you showered you were ankle deep in water.  Imagine sharing this room! The tub sides were so steep you had to lean into the sink and hold on to get in an out of the tub and I am a tall person!   Not to mention how long it took to drain afterwards.  You had to hold the handle down on the toilet to flush or flush it multiple times. You were given two small, old towels  daily for two people.  There was no coffee in the room or the lobby but there was one, small bottle of water (give credit where due) in the room. There wasn't even a pen or paper in the room.  The breakfast was E14 and not",1,1
It is classified as “accessible” hotel but it is just the oppossite: the wheelchair hardly fit through the narrow halls and it is impossible to get into the bathroom of the room (where the shower has a big stair). To go to the buffet there are only stairs and the super narrow lift was broken!,1,1
"Great location, descent size room. Staff were nice except on our last day, we were about to check out on our way down to reception the lift just suddenly stopped working. Being stuck in a lift for 5mins is already scary enough so imagine being stuck inside a tiny lift for 1.5 hours with an infant! I had to bang the door so hard hoping for someone to hear me thank god someone did. No one knew what to do.  It was so hot inside the lift and I was so worried for my daughter, I can’t believe someone had said that “it’s okay we won’t suffocate because there’s oxygen inside the lift” I was having a hard time waking her up!

My husband’s watch was stolen from the safe in our room, the night before our departure. The code was changed, so we couldn’t open it, when someone came to help, the watch was misssing. The manager said unless we filed a police report, there was nothing they could do. We had to choose between going to the police station to file a report or catch our next train. As we were running late, we had no option. No wonder why they stole it exactly the day before our departure.  Oh and also, the fire alarm went on at 3:00 in the morning, and almost gave us a heart attack as we ran downstairs with all the other guests. Not funny at",1,1

Unfortunately we did not discover this until checking into our hotel in Bayeux, Normandy late (8pm) on the evening of the 24th.

We arrived late on a Sunday evening, tired from a train journey from Amsterdam. Took a short bus ride from Gare du Nord. Nessima (?) was on the front desk that evening and made us feel very welcome. I was very pleased that they had provided the specific room I had requested for, despite not getting guarantees during my email exchanges with them a few weeks back.   The room size was just right, it was slightly smaller than expected but I've browsed through photos of their room so it wasn't much",2,1

On the second day, I forgot to zip the carry-on and when I came back to the hotel, all my money was gone. I reported the front desk right away next morning and also went to a nearby police station to file a report. I received emails from the hotel manager but never once met her in person. I would expect or appreciate if she had come and explained the investigation process. No further info was disclosed to me. All she said was this situation never happened before. (Or perhaps no one reported / realize that he lost money!) No money was returned. No offer discount or any compensation whatsoever!!! Sadly, my money was safer carried around Paris than",2,1
"Hardly justifies the three star category - room was small, dark, carpet was badly stained and felt dirty, very noisy as we were on the first floor facing the street.  wardrobe space was minimal and bathroom was small and austere.  Staff however, we very friendly.",2,1
"This hotel has the smallest rooms I have ever seen.  As a regular traveller to Paris, I am used to small rooms but this hotel takes it to a new level. The size of the room was not reflected in the price.  As with all Astotel hotels, the reception staff are efficient, pleasant and helpful.  Unfortunately, this didn't extend to the woman who presides over breakfast.  She was rude, served us coffee that had been brewing all morning and refused to make new coffee, refused to replenish the eggs even though we arrived 20 minutes before breakfast ended and was just generally unpleasant.  The bathrooms are a good size and spotless but the hairdryers do not work and they were unable to provide one that did.  I would never book this hotel again.",2,1
"4 times fire alarm in two days has been simply too much for us and spoilt our short weekend. We not believe that the alarm has been caused by somebody either smoking or using too much deodorant. Thank you very much, Astotel!",1,1

The upside free coffee and cold drinks at the reception from noon to midnight. We were double charged for the taxi the hotel booked for us. The receptionist  took the booking and advance for airport drop @ total cost of 108 euro, but the driver demanded 15 euro extra for luggage. The receptionist at duty just expressed her helpless. Having no choice we had to accede to the extra charge!!",2,1

"Normally a bad or unjustified experience would prompt me to write a review on this platform, as I would like everyone to be aware and not be ""mis-guided"" by over-hyped and favorable reviews, that usually did not substantiate my own experience.  The following review is borne out of the very reason stated above.  A few let downs during our 5 nights stay:  1. Toiletries are not replenished.  These items are not back-filled, even our bottles have been sitting empty for 2 days.  2. Sheets are not changed even when they were soiled.  We understand and advocate for the environmental cause of keeping the sheets unchanged every day; however, in the event that they are soiled, I believe they should be, at least for the part (e.g. pillow case or sheets only) that should be  refreshed.  3.",1,1
"The room was nice, although very small.  Location wasn't great.  Not in the best area. There's not a lot around it. Quite a walk from the train station (esp with suitcases).  Metro Stations are not real close either. Probably a 10 minute brisk walk.  Front desk reception is sketchy at best.    It depends on whether you have the man drinking wine whilst on duty.  This same man also likes to ""call"" restaurants and pretend to make dinner reservations for you.  My husband and I traveled a half hour out of our way to a place that didn't exist. What a bunch of BS.  We received an email from the alleged ""manager"" trying to explain away the lack of effort and diligence.  Poor.  Better to receive no email than one with obvious lies to cover up the wine drinking and fake restaurant",2,1
"I did not get this hotel. True, it was clean, but that’s my only positive impression. First of all, the location is not that convenient. If you want to be close to the Gare du Nord, especially if walking with heavy luggage, rethink the choice of this hotel.  The Metro stops are not that close either for those carrying luggage. Since I did not want to walk up a hill with my luggage back to the train station (yes the hotel is on a hilly street), I asked for a taxi at the hotel front desk. The response I got was that calling a taxi was not possible. I asked the front desk person if there was a problem with the phone or if the taxis were on strike and he simply said no and walked way.  Needless to say I was shocked by his rudeness, since the few reviews I read here about this hotel",2,1
"Location is lovely, close to the most attractive attractions. We could walk where we wanted. The are has loads of restaurants and bars, a very good atmosphere.  Check in was good and efficient. The lift was tiny. Our room was very cold and the windows had a constant draft: we had to keep our curtains shut. The room was small and crammed, not at all comfortable for 2 people with luggage. Cleaning was mediocre. Too few towels in a very small bathroom.   The room was noisy: we could hear the traffic and people in the streets, as well as people in the hallway. Breakfast was OK.   All in all, not worth the money we paid. Location was the biggest positive factor here!",2,1
"The hotel is very well located as you have the metro Grands Boulevards right in front of the hotel. You have a starbucks close by , the theatre trevise or theatre des variétés really close by. But the rooms are small, the bed is awful (Size, quality), the smell in the entire hotel is awful. The room Are too hot and no Posibility to have fresh air, if you open the window you have the ventilation noise. You can barely see yourself in the mirror in the main room if you want to put make up on. The bathroom Is tiny. Bad bad",2,1
"Unfortunately the room I was given resembled a cupboard, and was absolutely nothing like the photos for the room that I booked. I was really upset by this. The bathroom was extremely outdated too and the bathroom door did not actually close.",2,1
"The rooms are very hot, and the courtyard outside is very noisy so opening the window is not really an option.  Also, the room was very tatty - lots of broken furniture items, broken shower screen, etc",2,1
High Price and Average Quality. Almost No amenities in the room and the bathroom! A single room incl. breakfast cost almost 200 Euro per night. The location is great just by the metro station and the breakfast was not excellent but it was okay. For the money paid and 4-star hotel it was significantly below expectations.,2,1
"I were going a weekend to Paris and had points that I need to spend. I therefor booked on night at this hotel. It was supposed to be a standard double room, there was bearly enough space on the floor between the wall and the bed to be able to open the suite case, but then it was not possible to move around in the room. I have been staying at Melia hotels in many countries, and if this is the standard that Melia allows their hotels to have on the rooms, then the stadard has fallen drastically. On the positive side, the bed was good to sleep in and the breakfast was ok.",1,1
"I've been in several Melia hotel in Spain and Europe, and this hotel doesn't reach the Melia Standards. There was a leak on the room I mention it to the cleaner and reception and when I came back the leak still there..... and the shower has black mold in the walls.",1,1
My daughter husband and I had 2 rooms booked for the weekend on the Bastille in July. Both small rooms on the 5 th floor. The clerk checking us in was very good as we're all the staff. The first night was good but during the second the room became warm. And I mentioned this but was told it would be fine. Returning to our room in the evening the air con was not working and had in fact broken down. We spent a very uncomfortable night as did many other people. No advantage being silver card holders. Felt as though a refund should have been given . Definitely would not stop in this Melia when in Paris.,2,1

"We stayed in Room 101 for 3 nights & it lived up to its Orwellian reputation (á la 1984).  This hotel is billed as a 4* but the room was tiny, no bigger - and quite possibly smaller - than a typical Ibis hotel room.  The room was uncomfortably warm. The aircon didn't work and the window could not be opened more than an inch or two due to the location of the desk/dressing table in the room. But that didn't matter as outside the window an enormous, metallic exhaust/vent protruding out of an adjacent wall of the hotel exhaled so much noise all through the night, that opening the window for ventilation was not a feasible option!  Also, the toilet blocked twice.  I hope the hotel management doesn't respond to this review by saying that I should have raises these matters with them, as",2,1
"Great location, basic... that’s where it ends.  If you’re going to refurbish a hotel at least close or ventilate until the paint fumes are no longer going to make your guests suffer! Won’t be selecting this one again",1,1
"Room was clean and hotel truly centrally located. Staff helpful and friendly. However, this is most definitely NOT a four star hotel. Room is small, bathroom shower gives new meaning to word tiny. Had to stand in place to take a shower, barely any room to move. Room clean but looks refurbished. Stayed five days, was without air conditioning for four days. Slept with windows open. Room faced street and was very noisy all night. Bed was comfortable. Breakfast standard fare. Looking for just bare bone lodging? you found it. Looking for four star? keep looking. Will not stay there again",2,1
Very noisy because of work until 9pm in the building beside. Very very small room. I never saw a  small bed like that. No advantage of having Melia card. Poor and no variety in the breakfast.only location is great,2,1
"This is NOT a 4 stars hotel. Our room had no day light as the window opens to the AC and vents equipments in the small courtyard.The machines are right in front of the windows . The guests are smoking,2 AM mind you, front desk could not resolve the issue.So it is NOT a non smoking hotel either.The smoke smell was so strong we didn’t know if the idiot smoking will fall asleep with the cigarette and set the hotel on fire.....this till 3 AM ,chain smoker watching soccer on TV. Now the room was so small we had to open the suitcase on the bed as there was no room to do so on the floor. Forget about the bathroom....you could wash your hands while sitting on the toilet! And go up the stairs with your suitcase to reach the elevator. I have to say the front desk persons are really nice",1,1
We only stayed 3 nights. First night hotel gave us a very small room. I daclare that that is not the room I saw on the internet and I paid for. Second day after our travel agencys email and my continous complaints. I achived to speak hotel manager. Second day Hotel gave us the right room. Probably if did not complain. I would stay a smaller room but I paid for a bigger one.,1,1

Many mails sent by the dont want to listen to me.",1,1
"On a positive note, this was in a great location.  Centrally to all the restaurants and pubs in the Opera area with the metro just outside.  The staff were really friendly and helpful.  it was clean, looked fresh and modern. The negative site.  We had an internal room which looked out into the middle courtyard, which had 2-3 generators in.  The room was tiny, you could not ""swing a cat"" in the room and was so hot.  I don't normally suffer with ""hot"", if anything I moan about the cold, but this room was boiling.  There was no air conditioning available, even though they had the dials etc.  We tried opening the window, but this made no difference at all.  It was really stuffy.

Arrived at the hotel to a 2 night stay. Booked and paid for a premium city view room via booking.com. This room was not available - amazingly they were still selling the same rooms online. They did offer an inside room with a bicycle in the middle of it but if I wanted that we would have booked it. They refused to make a refund. Beware also that no management in the hotel.   Went elsewhere - no refund 4 months later despite reaching out to the property and booking.com.   Not a pleasant start to a weekend in Paris. Plenty of opportunity since to address this. Very unfortunate as have stayed here since 2004.,1,1
"As a frequent traveler, I am at a cross-roads here how best to describe this hotel.  I will summarize, it as most expensive on a per-square meter basis even when including services.   The ONLY thing working for this hotel is its location. That is what you’re paying for. Even by that standard you have a few options.  Let us start that this is a budget style hotel, but bills you like a 4 or 5 star hotel.  The rooms are extremely crammed, the bathrom even more so, the shower-stall is very claustrophobic. The hotel rooms don’t have any sort of a kettle or coffee/tea arrangement. The air-conditioning (or heating) unit probably doesn’t work. We switched it on, but it made no noticeable difference in the room temperature.  We had to leave the window open at night. Which results in a",1,1
"I had a very disappointing experience at this hotel due to the extremely tiny room I was given, in which I could barely move. Even by Paris or European standards, this is in no way  acceptable for a 4 star hotel. Not only was the room tiny with barely room to move around the bed, it looked into a small internal service courtyard and had very bad natural light. The bed was a small single bed, almost like a dorm bed, which I have never seen anywhere else even when staying as single occupancy. Of course I complained about the room as soon as I came in, but was informed that the hotel was fully booked and there was no other option, and I was asked to check again the next day if there was another room I could be moved to. My issue with this is that this room is not fit to be in a 4",2,1
"House keeping enters your room whenever they feel like it, even with the ""Do not disturb"" sign on doors. No privacy expected. They also trash personal medical items from your room and no one is hold accountable for the issues. Front desk staff is not proficient in English and cannot resolve any issues you may encounter during your stay. Expect no preferential treatment as a Melia rewards member, you are just another guest. Housekeeping makes noises from 9am and on, you may not rest as you would like.",2,1
"For my last business trip to Paris, the usual Melia hotels that I take were full (La Defense and Melia Champs Elysees) so this was offered as an alternative. The front desk staff was super friendly, that, besides the bed, was the best about the stay. I reported 3 problems with my room, they were totally ignored. The breakfast was also another disappointment, the bread was very hard to chew, the staff was not very motivated. If I compare it to other Melia Hotels, then I don't understand what is happening here.",2,1
"Hotel room was extremely hot. I was unable to get a good nights sleep, and opening the window did not help due to high temps outside, and facing a tiny courtyard. The AC barely made a difference and then after 2 nights, it just completely broke. Hotel staff did not seem phased at all by this. Additonally, the wifi was extremely slow and basically unusable, and then also broke completely. The halls of the hotel were very strange with many doors throughout and the room was tiny. The location was centrally located, but we still ended up taking the metro to everywhere we went.  Overall I would not recommend this hotel. After walking around the city all day, the last thing you want to do is come back to a stuffy, hot hotel room with no WiFi. I would consider tthis more of a 2-star,",2,1
Please DONOT Stay at this property  You will get -  - wrong room - smaller size that described or paid for - poor unfriendly slow staff - cramped smelly rooms - world's smallest lift - noisy night (pub next door opens till 5am on Friday/Sat),1,1
"Our 5 night stay at this hotel was very disappointing. I had read positive reviews prior to booking and some of it was true like the convenient location next to Metro,shops, cafes and large size of our family room.  The staff were friendly and helpful but the hotel itself was not up to par.  First, the hotel was under renovations and views were blocked by tarps.  The strong paint smell didn't help either. Secondly, the room was newly updated but the uneven flooring was a hazard to walk. Our bathroom had a strong mold/mildew smell and the shower door was broken,  And if you slept past 8:00 am then the construction noise would wake you up. The Irish pub below  also played loud music past 3:00am.  Unfortunate scenario for  such a great location.",2,1
Do not stay in any on the 214 side of the hotel you'll be kept up all night with noise from the Irish bar and drunkards on the street because of it !!! Shame as clean hotel nicely decorated - staff weren't interested that we were kept awake every night !!,1,1
"construction going on - expect noise. Airconditioning is only on in June, expect very stuffy rooms. Construction work outside does not help as opening the windows brings in dust, noise and lack of privacy as workers are walking around on scaffolds right outside.  Reception staff was not accommodating at all, only offered a fan which was not adequate.",1,1
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 10 nights (Jan 18-27th) for Men's Fashion Week. We were looking for a hotel that was clean, modest, centrally located and close to the locations of the trade shows. I can say that TRYP met these criteria and we were ""almost"" pleased with our stay until the very last day (I'll explain later).  The Good: The hotel is walking distance from the shopping district, several good restaurants ( FYI when you are tired of eating french food - look for Bien Bien (Thai) or T'sero D'Italia (Italian)), and is less than 1 minute from the metro. The night staff (older gentleman with gray hair) is an absolute darling and provided customer service unmatched by his colleagues. The cleaning staff is great and provided excellent turndown service.  The Bad: We",2,1
Title says it all  Good location Excellent staff Good buffet breakfast  Good clean rooms but discordant bass sounds from club. Solutions? Accor to buy up the club or improve soundproofing nb this is not a criticism  of any road noise only the bass noise from the club The staff were aware of the noise and said attempts had been made to get the club to turn  down the sound to no avail,2,1
"This hotel was difficult to find and certainly not what I would have expected. The maize to find your room was insane, the room was small and very warm. A homeless lady slept outside the front door and it would seem she didn't move far to use a washroom. Would not recommend.",2,1
"Travel planner, stayed with TRYP Europe locations many times, now seeking a refund for a canceled room, Expedia did not cancel and caught in a loop between TRYP Opera, Expedia and American Express....disappointed in all. Same situation w/ Choice booking for Comfort Inn Paris and they IMMEDIATELY ISSUED ME A TOTAL REFUND for reservation that I had attempted to cancel, but system failed me. CUSTOMER SERVICE EXCELLENCE is a most important factor in travel and so far no REFUND.",1,1
First room that we've received was terrible - there was noise outside the window because there were airconditioners working day and night so it was hard to fall asleep. Next day we received another room - it was better because it was queiter but it was cold at night. Room was tidy but very small. Nothing special about the hotel for this price.,2,1
"If I could give this place a Negative rating I would.   I arrived at this hotel for check in on June 18, 2015.   Upon arriving in my room. We noticed that there was mold all along the wall of the room. We immediately notified the hotel staff and they were NOT surprised to hear about the mold. In fact, the manager of the hotel explained that during the week prior to June 18th, they found mold in the room across from ours. We were on the second floor, in the back corner.  Getting to the room was similar to walking through a maze. You walked up the stairs and opened a door and then another one that lead you down a hall. The room was stuffy and the hallway was narrow with lots of house keeping supplies out on display. The elevators were only large enough for 2 suite-cases.    Do NOT",1,1
"Location is perfect. You can walk to almost all areas. 10 minutes walk from Many Monuments. Metro is in front of the door and will bring you everywhere. Nice boulangerie at 50 metres on small street, one very good restaurant in front of boulangerie called chez papa. Tho, the rooms are very small, no control over temperature, ( so hot) toilet and shower broken, and very smelly (had to change room as per ours smelled from the toilet). Wifi in rooms, nice loby (abusive charge for breakfast), and parking around is 38 euro per night.   Worth the 110$ had per night but must be aware that, location is perfect but rooms aren't.",2,1
"This hotel has a really good location, right by the metro and the breakfast is quite alright. Unfortunately, the unfriendly staff and small room/bathroom draws the rating down considerably. You can most likely find a cheaper hotel with the same standard.",2,1
"This hotel needs a full renovation. It's cheap for Paris, but there is a reason for it. The rooms are very very small, and many need a full renovation. I had a tiny room overlooking an internal courtyard, which was basically air ducts, and the carpet was torn, the fixtures peeling off, and the bathroom so small there was barely room for the toilet. Breakfast buffet is OK. Staff are lovely, but can't make up for the dreadful state of the hotel. There are worse in Paris, of course, but plenty better.",2,1
"When life throws you lemons, as the old saying goes- make lemonade!! This hotel is a personification of that saying. It is old outdated and in a very nice part of Paris surrounded by beautiful parks, restaurants and walk to some of the attractions in the heart of the city. Other than that the fun stops there.  If it were a hostel, it would fair well but as part of the Melia chain- it falls short of the standards one would expect of Melia and their subsidiaries or associates. Perhaps visitors may with to take a ""tryp"" elsewhere; Or stay and make lemonade.",1,1
The light fittings falling off the wall in room 211. Shower gel empty in shower when we arrived.Unconcerned staff. I am a Melia loyalty card holder. Changing my bookings in London for later this year to another group.,1,1
"This hotel does not live up to the Melia name…We had issues with the rooms, bathrooms, space, and air conditioning. We arrived and the reservation of one of the room was incorrect, their ""correction"" was flawed and uncomfortable.  Had issues with air-conditioning, they corrected then had noise issues (woke us up), they corrected by moving us again, two days, two rooms! Had issues with bathroom and was advised to wait until the next day!  Bunch of issues, just not up to par!",2,1
Paid for superior room and given standard room; compensation offered was free breakfast which we couldn't use. Night light fell off wall on my husband's head and not repaired. Given a room on a lower floor located over a bar - extremely noisy at 5am closing time,2,1
Outside the window in room 106 there's a huge engine which loud noise does not allow us to sleep at all.  At 2 AM we asked to change the room and our request was accepted. We had assigned a more comfortably room at 4th floor without any surcharge.,1,1
"My experience at this hotel was horrible!  My room did not have air conditioning and it was unbearably hot.  Opening a window did not help.  To add to the experience, the pub next door played loud music until 5:00/5:30 am.  The bass boomed all night making sleep impossible. Don't stay at this hotel unless you like the sound of bass while trying to sleep and you like being very, very sweaty!  Very disappointing experience.",1,1
"Recently stayed at this hotel ,Great location as its right near the Grand Boulevards metro station,  but thats it!    Summary: Hotel looks tired and need modernisation its a basic 3 star.  ***IMPORTANT*** WHEN BOOKING JUNIOR SUITES ONLINE,   ALL JUNIOR SUITES ARE IN THE FRONT OF THE HOTEL UPON 1ST FLOOR, THEREFORE IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN THEY WILL NOT SLEEP DUE TO THERE BEING  MANY BARS CLOSE BY  Example Sullivans Irish Bar under the 1st floor windows.  THEY WILL NOT TELL YOU THIS WHEN BOOKING!! All confirmed by the receptionist.  We immediately requested a change of room  as soon as were told where our room was.

"This hotel was a waste of time and money. Other than the metro stop right outside the hotel, there was nothing that was good about it. We were given a tiny, moldy room initially, the windows behind the curtains are completely black with mold and mildew, if you are allergic to mold and moisture smell and don't like dark dingy rooms, faulty tiny bathroom( the shower was so defective that keeping water coming out of the shower was next to impossible. I had to wipe the bathroom everyday as water would just run out, no matter how carefully you took shower. Very bad reception staff, when you are waiting to be be checked in/ check out, they just put your luggage in a tiny room which is on the main street and any one can just come inside and take away your luggage. While checking out",1,1
"This is a hotel which may make travelers have an decent stay in Paris or ruin it. Paying during the weekend about 90€ for a room can be considered as acceptable and wise for the service provided. However, 180 € for the same room can be seen as overpriced and not worthwhile.  Rooms facing the ""courtyard"" will gift guests with a noisy aircon system, so be prepare in advance and bring your earplugs if you want to have a quite sleep. Rooms facing the Boulevard will contribute to enjoy the experience of having nightmares because of the Irish bar just beside the hotel.  The hotel it is well located. It has a great potential to be one of the best places where to stay in Paris. To achieve that objective, it would need to be refurbished, updated and noise isolated.  It was not acceptable",2,1
"I stayed in this hotel earlier in the Summer. I had a nice size and bright room, a good and comfortable bed, nice aircon. Slept well, very happy. I stayed again last week - it was late October in Paris, and so the management decided that it must be cold. So they de-activated all the aircon. Except, the night I stayed it was actually hot. The room (unlike my last one) was ridiculously small - certainly no room to swing the proverbial cat, and it was STIFLINGLY hot. So, I opened the window. My room looked over the courtyard which hosts an absurdly loud generator (or something). Opening the window only marginally reduced the room temperature. The hotel receptionist was powerless to re-activate the aircon, and so I was stuck with the situation. The consequence: a nght of ZERO sleep.",1,1
"Tryp Paris was the last hotel we stayed at on our recent 14 day vacation in Europe.  I screen all hotels against tripadvisor ratings/comments and this is the first time I was not impressed.  First, I will allow that the hotel is clean, the location is very good and our kids loved the bunk beds.  Here is what I found unacceptable (beyond the alarmingly small elevators).  Check in is at 2pm.  I arrived with the family from the airport at 2:10pm and was told the room was not ready.  I asked when I could return and was told that the room would be ready in one hour.  We were told to check our luggage in a room down the hall (the whole process was self-serve).  After a wonderful lunch, we returned at 3:45pm only to be told the room still was not ready for us.  I spoke with the manager",2,1
"I guess if you are use to staying in hostels, or are in college and are looking to split 200 bucks a night with your bros, this indeed is a ""good value"" considering it's one plus is its location: 20 minute walk to Le Louvre. Outside of that, however, there is little upside.  When my girlfriend and I checked in after a tiring journey from Spain, we noticed the neighborhood was very vibrant. The vibrancy of the neighborhood was an interesting contrast to the sour nature of the front desk hotel man. For example, when asking for adapters, we were barely able to get two (both of which ended up not working). When also asking for a customary guide/map, he told us they were ""over there""- as in, go fetch yourself on the other side of the room.   When we got to our hallway, I instantly",2,1
"The hotel had 2 good things: comfortable beds and a fantastic location with a metro station outside the door. So what is the problem then? it was Saturday night and we got a room facing the main street. To our dismay, there is a disco right next door which keeps your room vibrating to the beat until 5am. If you can sleep through that, and the shouts and screams from the merry disco clients as they leave, then by all means stay here. However, if you forget your earplugs and you are being charged the prices requested by this medicore hotel, then you might feel extremely upset at the experience. Then again, if you get a different room the hotel could scrape by. The receptionists are generally unplesant as well. And just in case you are wondering, the disco beat also continues on",1,1
"This Tryp hotel has a good location near Boulevard Hausmann, Opera and the metro. Rooms are overpriced since they are tiny and need refurbishing. Personnel offers good service though. Not worth the money, even for Paris standards.",2,1
"We booked at this hotel for 7 nights and had to request hot water 6 times.  They turned the boiler back on and 15 minutes later we had hot water.  The metro is right outside the door and very easy to make connections.  Very noisy area - clubs and restaurants in the area go until 5:30am, in fact the Sunday morning that we left at 7:45am there were still people at the bar on the corner.  Shower was very small and the room clean and fairly large for a 3 star building.  While the room was clean i.e. bedding carpeting etc. the bathroom door did not close completely due to misalignment, chipped floor tiles, metal bathroom windows badly rusted, staff very pleasant and helpful and bilingual.  Would rate it 2 out of 5 due to location just short of a 3 star hotel",2,1

"I booked the Tryp Francois Hotel with 2 other friends for our trip to Paris.  The hotel is non-descript from the outside, and you are greeted by a  double pair of glass doors which you need to manouevre to get inside the reception area, ie you need to open a first set of glass doors (tirez!) to get inside a small dead space before having to open another set of glass doors (tirez encore!) which can be a handful especially with large luggage.  The reception is fairly bland although they've installed a large LCD tv (mostly for the reception staff's benefit I believe) with a view to a podium dining area where breakfast is served.   Reception staff are quick and efficient and speak good english. The older gentleman was especially courteous and helpful.  The lift was small, but this",2,1
"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The location was great and our room was very clean, but so small that we had no room for even our suitcases. You had to inch your way around the bed and into the tiny bathroom. The hallways and lift also only accomodated one person and a small suitcase. The staff were extremely unhelpful. It advertises room service as a feature, however this was a pizza hut menu in french which when you rang had no english speaking staff. If you asked reception to help you order they flatly refused. It left a real dampner on our stay in paris.",2,1
"This place is to be avoided at all costs. When we arrived the receptionist denied that i had made a restervation and made me print out a copy from my email. He was rude and unhelpful and at first i thought he was in a bad mood but it turned out he represented the culture of the hotel. We had booked a superior room but we were DOWNGRADED without being given a discount. They also gave a key to a room that was already occupied and we walked in on two people at a very embarrasing moment. The hotel was disorganised, the beds were uncomfortable, and the hotel had a very uncomfortable atmosphere with a very dated recption. Also the breakfast was substandard. The hotel is in a good location but this was still the most dissapointing hotel experience i have had anywhere in the world.",1,1
"Don't believe what they advertise around, on same budget you can have a better choice in Paris. The hotel needs full maintenance, from the broken chairs in breakfast room, to broken seat and furniture in the bathroom, to the dirty sofas in the lounge. Breakfast personnel must be paid extra to be that rude!!! The ""Open bar: Snacks and non-alcoholic drinks offered free of charge every afternoon"" is a joke at least, there is almost nothing most of the times unless you go and ask. Would never stay at any of the chain's hotel again. Strongly not recommended!!!",1,1
"location is very good and staff speaks good English and very helpful and nice. Free soft drinks everyday from the bar fridge is very nice touch. Breakfast buffet is very nice too. However, we didn't really enjoyed our stay there. The room is very tiny, especially the shower is way too small. It's hard for us not to touch the shower curtain when we shower which we found it gross. You can hear the noise from the timber floor when people was walking. And our air con made noise too, my husband had a look of the filter and found it really dirty.",2,1
"When we checked in the girl at the desk only confirmed my ID& credit card...no mention of any facilities or details regarding amenities, I had to ask her about wifi/breakfast/mini-bar.  The room was unbearably hot, at least 30°C / 83°F...we had to leave our window, which overlooked a very noisy street, open in order to be inside the room or to sleep. The only answer front desk had for this was to turn off the radiator in the room, which we had already done.  Furthermore the older lady in the breakfast room rushes up to you screaming BONJOUR over and over again without indicating that she needs your room number to note that you've had your breakfast.  She needs to learn manners, I speak French fluently and still didn't know what she wanted because she didn't verbalize anything",1,1
"We booked a standard room in this hotel. Good reviews, good location, fair price, everything seemed OK. Our room was in 1st floor, window in a dark interior lightwell, room space extremely small. Soundproofing non existent. Wooden interior stairs crackling in every step, the subway moves your brain and the walls from plasterboards. Basic decoration, basic bathroom.  Helpfull stuff, good breakfast, very clean room and bathroom. Many TV chanels.  It would be more sincere to be informed about these ""special"" rooms. I would never stay in such a room, even for free.",2,1
The hotel was very clean. Food was excellent except it was not included in the quoted room rate.  Reception desk spoke very limited English.  AIR CONDITIONING was horrible. No a/c at all. They finally gave us a fan on outlast night.  Nice location.,2,1
"i advice u NOT to go there, rooms are very very small to the extent that if u put ur bag u cant move and to get to the other side u need to jump. Air conditioning is so noisy that u cant sleep and when i complaint about that they trnasfered to another much smaller and promised that in morning i will get the intiall room that i took but with a proper air conditioning, then in the morning they told me sorry we cannot move u from there to similar room that i had been.!!!!!!! To make long story short i got very angry and requested manager , woman of course, and was totally unprofessional and did not care about cusyomer satisfaction.   My advice DONt go there as u will waste ur time in quarelling and get anothet respectable hotel.",1,1
"For the same price there are better and friendlier hotels in Paris. Secondly, if you are a businessman this hotel is uncomfortable with signing for UPS, FedEx etc parcels for staying guests. Also the hotel elevator is a man trap. It literally takes 5 minutes to move between floors - very frustrating.",2,1
"The excellent and helpful staff could not make up for the noise, location, and bad room decor of this 9th arrond. hotel.  The hotel is in a somewhat seedy location that felt unsafe to be outside in after dark.  More importantly, however, the rooms are EXTREMELY NOISY, with motorbikes revving by all night.  I even went out and bought earplugs but they did not drown out the sound.  The rooms look like dorms - certainly not romantic or welcoming.  The bathroom was very clean.  The wi-fi did not work the entire time I was there, and although I asked about it I was not offered a partial refund for that important amenity.  The breakfast was hearty, although more like what you would see in a Holiday Inn in the midwest.",2,1
"Just spent one night in the hotel. The offer seemed reasonable. Especially the free Wifi they offered attracted me. Be careful. The bandwidth is limited to 0,08 to 0,11 Mbits. It is not sufficient to work reasonably. If you want more they charge you EUR 17 extra.  The rest of the hotel is quite nice. In case you do not need internet it might be a good place. But otherwise go somewhere else.",2,1
Have stayed here twice before and loved it but this time was terrible. We were put in a room on the ground floor with no air conditioning and it was 31degrees outside. We couldn't open the window as we were on the street level and the metro felt like it was just under the bed. when asked to be moved the staff told us the hotel was full. We are returning to Paris next April and we won't be staying here again.,2,1
"I felt fairly confident choosing this hotel based on previous reviews. I made a big mistake! I hope I can stop others wasting their cash. Pro's... Close to the Metro. Cons... Too close to the Metro. It runs from 5:15am to 1:15 am every 4 minutes and rumbles like loud thunder under the bed. The very hard uncomfortable bed, on the main road, without double glazing and noisey scooters passing all night. I got so little sleep I was too tired to do much. The bathroom stunk of sewage all night too. When asking reception the women pretend they don't understand or the guy tried to hit on me. I will never come back here and really hope no one else does either!!!!!",1,1

Well, I paid around $50 for the motel in Ohio and over $250 for the hotel in Paris.  I rather stay on those side of the road Ohio hotels.  Issues with this hotel:  1.	Room smelled. 2.

"We stayed here for three nights and booked two rooms, one for ourselves and one for our teenage son and our ten year old.  The hotel is situated near to St Georges metro which as other reviewers have said gives access to the whole of Paris, you have to change lines about four times to get to the Eiffel Tower but especially at night is well worth the effort. when it sparkles on the hour for ten minutes. Magical! On arrival we were met (eventually) by quite a surly and abrupt receptionist, he didn't ask how our trip had been or welcome us to the hotel, a very disappointing start.

We were not told at arrival that there was no hot water, I discovered it by myself having a cold shower having to wash my long hair. When I phoned the reception after that, they said they knew and that it would be sorted the next morning, which it wasn't. On Saturday morning, they said we could have a shower in a hotel that belongs to the same company 200 meters away and that we could move there. We didn't bother, as we didn't want to move all our stuff there. We also thought the problem would be sorted during the day. It wasn't.  They didn't offer a discount or another kind of compensation.  Warning: you can hear the metro going under the hotel. So about every 3 minutes, it's quite unsettling, especially",2,1
"This is my first time to go Paris with my GF and have a high expectation to have Romance & Fun experience; but the hotel screw up my dream.  First, they don't check the room condition before we checked in. Such as the broken floor by the washroom door which I am almost trap to fall; the therometer was not work which hanged to the wall. Third, there is no signal of ""make up room & don't disturb"" to hang  on the door. They don't help to solve the 1 st problem by helping the cutomers to move the luggages to the other room even their fault; the manager broke the promise not have any room to exchange and not giving the gift basket as compliment. Also the technician was not make sure no one in room before access to our room while we had cloth-changing!!  This is the worst traveling",1,1

"I have selected this hotel because it was recently renovated. I have used their homepage to make a reservation with my credit card. When I showed up after a long flight from SFO, they told me there is no available room although I had a confirmation for my reservation. They sent me to another Best Western hotel which was quite ugly. I have accepted this because I was quite tired. On my the way back to US, I have seen that my credit card was charged for a non-showup. This is a total scam. I have to go the whole process to make the refunding procedure.",1,1
"Neither air conditioning nor fan worked leaving us to open the window. Would be fine with that, but the area is very, very loud at night and does not settle down until 2am or later. After second night of no sleep and a hot room, we finally wised up and used ear plugs and got our first decent night's sleep. Our non-smoking room was small (no surprise, what we expected for Paris), but was surpised that guests staying in the room below ours liked to smoke out their window. Had to close the windows AND use earplugs to avoid having our clothes and room reek of cheap cigarettes. Convenience to the Saint-Georges metropolitan stop was very nice though. The breakfast included with the rate was decent and the hotel on the whole was modern and well-kept considering its age. Hotel staff is",2,1
"I booked a weekend away for my Boyfriends birthday for the 31 Oct to the 2nd November with dialaflight.  We found the Hotel to be very clean and tidy, and literally a minutes walk from the Metro.  The rooms were a little on the small size but perfect if you are staying for the weekend wanting to take in the beautiful sights of Paris.  Unfortunately I have to say, we were very disappointed with the staff.  We found them to be unhelpful and in some cases rude.   The Hotel booked us two rooms when we only required one.  They refused to see how a couple would want two rooms, and when I asked for the appropriate paperwork to send to dialaflight they refused outright and said the fault did not lie with them in a very discourteous manner.  Fortunately Dialaflight was more than helpful",2,1
"Having booked a double room, very disappointed to be shown a twin room on the ground floor.  The double room available turned out to be small and over-looking a busy street.  Also, you have to ask for the complimentary tea/coffee tray with kettle; which probably tells you all you need to know about this hotels attitude to guests.  The choice at the buffet breakfast was good though.",2,1
"The Hotel Management was Horrible.  We booked our room online and paid in advance.  They double charged us for two rooms due to computor error.  Weeks before staying we notified them and Best Western and were told tough luck.  Best Western tried to refund our money but the Hotel manager refused.  He told us tuff luck because they already have our money!!!!!  We though we could work it out while we were there but they shut the door in our face!  The hotel staff apologized and offered us a free breakfast..... wow that makes up for it. Luckly we booked with an Amx travel card and disputed the charge and it was removed.  I would never, never, never stay there as they treated us so horrible.  The hotel Lobby may look good from the outside but not from the inside!    We travel a great",1,1
PROS:    Style: I really liked the hotel- minimalist mod with a nod to the historical structure- exposed beams painted white.  Cool plastic chairs done in pop colors.    Cleanliness: Superclean  Good beds  Size of room: I was staying in room 601 which is big.  It has a cool little living area and the room has a sloped roof- it felt like being in a space-age garret.   I also spent some time in 602 which was smaller without the living area but had a huge bathroom.  CONS:  Loads of fire alarms: I experienced about 5 fire alarms on five different mornings.   I think I was there the same time Tones100 (read his/her funny review below!).  I was with the guy in the long old fashioned night shirt- I was laughing because he was the only one with traditional nightwear on- he really stuck,2,1
"Stayed at the BW Lorette Opera for the weekend in mid August.  Reason for choosing the hotel :  I fancied a base close to Monmartre and didn't want to break the bank on the cost as I was only planning on staying in the hotel for a couple of hours to sleep - the rest of the time would be spent sat outside cafes bars enjoying the sights of Paris on a warm summer weekend.  I wasn't completely bowled over with the hotel though, but will deal with the positives first :  LOCATION :  It is literally 1 minute uphill walk from St George metro stop, or a pleasant 10 min downhill amble from Pigalle metro.  I would suggest Pigalle as a better station to alight from if arriving via Gare du Nord train station.  It's a nice down hill walk and introduces you to the delights (some salubrious -",2,1
"I booked a room 15 Days ago and when i arrived, they told me that they had a reservation problem on computer, so they will give me a taxi for another room in St Lazare...CHARMING ! ! Take care, apparently, they used to practice Surbooking and when you arrive they put you in partner hotel in a horrible room and in a bad place.  In a word don t go there !!  ps : Furthermore, i confirmed ex critizes that the hotel is very noizy with the subway...",1,1
"I booked thru Expedia and double-checked a few times that this hotel has air-conditioning. Upon arrival, we found that the air-condition is turned off. My girlfriend called the reception and was told that it is winter time and we didn't need air-conditioning. I went down to the reception and the receptionist called Yves told me that when weather turn cold, people come turned off the air-condition and installed the heaters. And then he raised his voices 'What can I do?! You tell me what to do.'   If I haven't paid in advance, we would have checked out immediately. The last thing you want when you traveling, in particularly with your girlfriend, is to have bad bad bad customer service.",1,1
"Dreadful hotel - My partner and I stayed here for a long weekend - the room was absolutely tiny and we had booked and paid for a superior room.  When I asked to be moved, I was told all the rooms were the same size. When I pointed out that on the fire escape route plan on the back of the room door, a floor plan of the hotel proved we were in the smallest room,  I was told ""In that case, we are full"" -  The concierge was rude, and unhelpful - we could not get ice, and they refused to order a taxi for us - Do not stay here if you want a romantic weekend in Paris - It ruined it for us and will for you too.",1,1
"The room we had at this hotel was very large as far as European hotels go and it is right across the street from the metro station...unfortunately, that is about the only positive things that I can say about this hotel, other than if you're on a very tight budget than this might be the place for you (appx $100 night for a double room). The service at this hotel was very poor: the front desk was very put off by our requests, sometimes rude and almost always aggrivated by our questions. The hotel/room offers no amenities such as room service or in room movies and the housekeeping staff kept walking in on us and waking us up in the morning because we were interrupting their cleaning schedule by wanting to sleep in. The only advice moving forward that I can offer is that if you are",2,1
"This was portrayed as a value hotel by other reviews on Tripadvisor which was in a great location, which is why I booked it. Wrong.  Location was only average and not close to anything (although there were a few cafe's around) The lift can only fit one person ... yep, 1 person at a time! You needed to carry your bag up 4 steps to even get to the lift. Not easy when the bag is 30kg No breakfast available. There was a common area where you can put your own food in a shared fridge in you wanted. Yeah right ... like I'm going to do that. Room was like a hostel ... wait, no, I've stayed in hostels that were much better. Ran out of hot water half way thru the second shower each morning. My wife and I draw stays for the 1st shower. Price was OK, but for what it is, should be half.",1,1
"The hotel has a good central location with a market and restaurants nearby, but I had an unpleasant check-in experience with an individual who raised his voice while berating me and asking probing questions.",2,1
I had a friend come over at night for 2 hours and the owner CHARGED ME because he didn't see my friend leave and claimed that I can't have friends stay over. My friend did not stay over and the fact that he didn't believe me was very insulting. The place itself is fine for the price but I definitely won't be staying there again because he was clearly just trying to make money off of me.,2,1
"I came here following the great reviews from Tripadvisor.  The hotel was easy to find.  I rented three rooms, room 1, 2 and 7.  Room #1 and 2 where a little run down.  Room number 7 seemed to be better than the other rooms.  Rooms where small but very clean.  The beds where a little too hard for my taste and I had trouble sleeping and pain in my back in the morning.  My wife could not sleep either.  You could also hear people talking from room #2 as it was close to the entrance even when closing down the windows.  Parking was 30 euros per night.  My hotel reservation was canceled because my credit card declined because they tried to charge me before I arrived.  Not sure why my reservation was cancelled when I already paid for the first night stay.  It was a group of 8 people and",2,1
"I have visited Paris many times. this was my first stay at this hotel. My stay here was very meh... There were a few times that housekeeping came in to clean while I was in the room after I specifically requested for them to not come in (my room did not have any of those door knob labels to ask for privacy). The room was tiny, but very clean. The beds were harder than what I'm used to. Made for uncomfortable sleeping conditions. The clerks were very indifferent, which surprised me since the reviews here raved about the service. This hotel is located a few blocks from Pigalle, which is the area of Paris with strip clubs, sex toy stores, etc. I would recommend you walk towards the other direction. There are better hotels, with better service and in more charming locations.",1,1
"My girlfriend and I stayed here because of the price and great reviews. On our first night (tonight, August 26) we asked for an extra pillow, the clerk told me to come down and get it. Never been told that before but went down anyway. I said to the clerk ""Bonjour, extra pillow"", he then stood up, put his finger in my face and barked at me saying how rude I was ""when you're in someone's house, that is not how you ask"". I did asked in a respectful way and this is a hotel, not his house!Told him I no longer wanted the pillow using a few choice words and he ran out of his desk and pushed me out of the way of the elevator. He told me to get the F out of his hotel before he called the police.... I went back to my room and the police came knocking 30 minutes later. My girlfriend",1,1
"After reading so many positive reviews about this hotel I decided to book for my 2 nights stay in Paris. I was really excited because I had read this hotel had a wonderful view on the Eiffel Tower and was very close to the centre. When I got there I was asked to pay straight away without even seeing the room, which in true fairness was ok to me considering I had booked with the option pay at the property. The room was clean but very small and what they call view of the tower is in reality a very small portion of the tower you can only if you really push your head out of the window. Minibar was empty and hair dryer did not work. This is the first place I have visited that did not even have a toilet brush in the toilet. But the true problem was when we came back after having",1,1
"The room was small however adequate for our needs. It was a pretty mundane stay until the end  check out where the check out receptionist Ana was so unhelpful and rude it really left a bad taste in our mouths after a great trip to Paris. First we asked her for an itemised bill. No the printer was broken. Okay fine please could you email it to us. Followed by a look which suggested we had asked her for her first born child followed by a weary sign. The we asked her to book us a taxi  to the train station- pretty simple request you would have thought. She started off immediately by making excuses that it was difficult to get a taxi as it was raining. Funnily enough it did not seem difficult for a couple who were also waiting for a taxi in the reception area, who left after 5 mins.",1,1
"Rubish, I spent 10 minutes in the shower to adjust the water below 50 degrees, my feet were boiling.  I asked the receptionist for help, he told me to turn the valve, I said it is broken and I need to use another room or shower, he said that if it was broken it would be a problem in the whole hotel so it works, without shower today after a hard day",1,1
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a week to attend the French Open this year. We usually stay in higher end hotels, but decided to stay at this hotel because of its location close to friends in the 16th.  Not a great choice for a whole week. We had the courtyard room number seven, and it was super small. Very little storage in the room or the bathroom.    There was some construction going on in a nearby property and it woke us up every morning very early. The hotel has no control over this, but it was a huge negative.  For that alone, we would not return. If you are staying here, make sure to ask them if there is still construction going on in the adjacent property.  The bathroom amenities were limited. The shower leaked considerably onto the floor. We had to use all of",2,1
"We recently stayed in the hotel and honestly I went from extremely satisfied to quite offended and upset with how we are being treated. We arrived early Saturday morning and had a pleasant time, the staff was kind and got us a room promptly since we tired and jet lagged. The room was a bit tight but cozy, there was smell of vinegar but it quickly went away when we turned the ac on. Monday night I guess new people came to the hotel and complained we were being too loud but we were just watching tv before bed with one window open. The front desk told us to just close the window and it should be fine, we did as asked. On Tuesday our air breaks we call the gentleman at the front desk and he says it’s his first day he can do nothing since it’s after 5pm so he will try tomorrow , to",2,1
"The room was smelling horrible. I left the room 3 days ago but still my wallet (it was inside the safe) is smelling like barbecue. Also the room's style was so old. And there weren't any socket in bath. The room was so dark, especially the entrance of room. The bed and pillows were so bad.",2,1
Location and the hotel is nice in general. The staff is extremely rude and they don't care about the customers. They also make sure that you feel this. The checkin was awful and checkout as well. We needed taxis but the ladies at the reception just didn't care. We had to find our own taxi with our little girl under the rain and nearly missed the plane.,1,1
Hot water was often disrupted and we had to bath in cold water in most of our 4 days here. Internet wifi was frequently down. Both issues were feedback to receptionist but nothing was done. In fact the receptionist retorted that no one else complained about the issues and tried to portray us as difficult.,1,1
"Bad receptionist, who did not even bother to speak . We arrived at 12- or one at midnight. He was so sleepy that he was unable to talk clear and loud enough. He put us on the sixth floor. There was a lift up to 5th floor and then we had to cary the heavy lougage going one floor up by steps. The hotel did not have any parking and we had to spend 50 euros on parking.  Very small room for a couple.  There was a building work at the building next door, and at 7 in the moring they were hamering. Oh it was terible...:((((",1,1
We stayed here on our first night in Paris. The room was tiny. The bed spread had stains on it that appeared to be from bodily fluids. I felt dirty and cheap the whole time I was in this room!!! On the positive side the lady that was at the front desk was extremely helpful and very nice!,2,1

"Recently I stayed at this hotel for business. I travel often for business and for pleasure but never before have I stayed in a hotel as bad as this one. The room was shabby, the bed had big black hairs in it, the shower was either freezing or scorching, the traffic outside loud and worse of all the airconditioner made a horrible buzzing noise the entire night. I did not sleap a wink. To top it off, when I complained, the staff said it wasn't their problem and at one point even started shouting at me. What a nightmare!  Do yourself a favour, NEVER stay here.",1,1
"Recently travelled to the beautiful city of Paris for a wedding and this was one of the hotels recommended as it was close to the church. The hotel is located in a great spot but I have to say that is all this hotel has going for it. We had originally booked to stay for 5 nights as all of our family was staying here also. On arrival we were informed there was some refurbishement work being carried out between 10 and 5 each day. Little did we know the extent to which this work was being done, only to see the complete mess that  was waiting when we got to our floor. Painting material everywhere,  noxious smell of paint,  bare walls, the dirt and dust was unbelieveable. We were not allowed to use the stairs which were completely blocked with painting equipment and had to wait upto",2,1

"I just wrote the previous review two nights into a five night stay. I'm not so enthusiastic as I was about the hotel. Still a nice clean, convenient place to stay, but the internet went out for a day and a half during my stay (which was for business -- internet was required). The night receptionist told me yes, it was out, and no, they wouldn't be calling anyone about the problem until the next day. Hrm. The second problem I had was with the lack of air conditioning which occurs from October onward. when the air goes off, the heat automatically comes on. I woke in the middle of the night hot and sweaty. Called the night receptionist. He said open the windows. Duh -- single female traveller in a first floor room facing the noisy main road? I don't think so. Would not help me to",2,1

"First up this hotel had no closet,no dressers and was considered 4+ rating. No face clothes, small non working t.v. and no internet. Our room was not ready at 3 pm in the afternoon,  it was still set up for one bed and not 2 twins. There was 2 inches between the beds, and the one bed was 2 feet from bathroom or 3 feet from toilet. People are raving Bout it being boutique style, that's B.S. They advertise free afternoon tea and pastries, omg literally one kind of dried up tarts, one kind of a loaf cake and one kind of muffin.It was not ""PASTRIES"". I woul not recommend this place to any one.",1,1
"In late May I stayed at this hotel while I was traveling for work. I chose the hotel largely because of glowing reviews for the staff. Instead, my trip became a nightmare when one of the night managers R. [-], insisted on walking me to my room because I'd been drinking. Thinking this was in line with the ""staff treats you like family"" reviews I'd previously read, I allowed him to walk me to my room. What I did not know at the time was that he would push his way into my room and sexually assault me. He broke my foot in the struggle. I reported the incident to Paris police who helped me move hotels hours later. To date, the hotel will not confirm whether or not this individual was fired. DO NOT STAY HERE.",1,1

"First of all, I will say overall the hotel environment is pretty good, however, there are some point are really disappoint and annoying me while I'm staying. I was go through my travel agents which is the biggest Japanese travel agency in United States suggest to book this hotel. I am a fashion designer & floral designer, I want to stay in the chic boutique hotel, after their few suggestion, and I went through all the review here.  I finally choose Le 123 Sebastopol. Unfortunately there were some issue happening while I was staying Firstly- since I got pickpocket stolen most of my credit card in Berlin, My travel agent already help me fill up all the authorizing form to fully pay all the hotel fee, I clearly get inform when I check in that I don't need to worry about it since",2,1
"This hotel is definitely not worth the money. If you are staying in Paris for one or two nights, it is fine.  More than than that, I strongly suggest looking into renting a condo--it's a lot more space. If I had to do it again, I would either save my money and stay at a 2-3 star property in Paris (which I've done plenty of times before) or spring for the cost and stay at a real luxury hotel.  In the States, this hotel would basically be considered a Comfort Inn.  My husband and I were traveling for our 20th anniversary. When we got there our room was 2 twin beds (not a great way to spend a 20th anniversary). The front desk staff told us they would fix the issue and we could have coffee in the lobby while we waited.  They never came to get us!  45 minutes later, my husband asked",2,1
"I have no idea how this place is ranked number1.  I'm here now and am probably going to relocate because the hotel is $300-500CDN per night and its ridiculous.  The decor is neat but tacky. The service is great and friendly. There is room service....sometimes. Really just sometimes. The hotel info online and in the room claim to have room service but when you call they say there is none. If you get a different worker there is...but there is no menu.. ""what do you want? "" they will ask. The question itself being pointless since the only thing they can make is a turkey or tuna sandwich and if you want to check off ""have eaten the worst sandwich ever"" from your list of things to do in life... have at it.  Also be prepared to wait about an hour for a sandwich and some drinks. Maybe",2,1
"It could be argued that for 200 euros a night with breakfast and internet connection included, in central Paris this hotel could be good value for money. If on the other hand you are seeking a solid 4 star hotel with the basic comforts that come with it, I am sorry but you are in the wrong place. Here are the reasons why... Yes, the hotel is fun if you are into films and looking for a tourist, light-hearted experience; it is not fun anymore if you need to work from your room and need a comfortable chair to sit on for some time and a good night sleep. The chair was dreadful and no armchair in the room / aircon  so noisy I could not sleep.... Design is new but furniture is on the cheap side and it shows, reminds me of an university hall accommodation where everything is new on",2,1
"We went there because it was a special birthday to my wife. Later on, our daughter surprised us by coming as well. We called the hotel and talked about changing the room for 3 persons, they told us that it’s no problem but the third person has to pay an extra charge. The day we went there was the special day to my wife. When we checked in, they gave us a room for 2 persons but with an extra bed and they put it in the middle of the room and we had no space to move, not even celebrate a birthday!!! We complained about the room because the deal was to have a triple room! The receptionist was very rude, that he didn’t even try to help or fix the problem that THEY caused!! They even told us you can leave the hotel if you don’t like it… The service was really bad, 0/10. Just for the",1,1

Bath was broken in our deluxe room. After a visit from 2 plumbers and lots of noise and disruption I was offered a smaller room - and no apology. Instead I had to go online and show there was indeed larger rooms available. I had to pay incredible excess price to ensure we had enough space - again no apology or discount offered.  Had to wait 2 hours at bedtime for sheets / bedding for kids bed - no apology. When we had to move rooms, no help was offered, some toys left behind - no one on the hotel was able to find and again, no apology. Great location but clearly do not need or want families at the",1,1

It wasn’t very clean in the common areas and the first day we found a used pillow case from the previous guests in our room, also there was a constant noise from the elevator so we changed room .  The last day after our check out I realized I forgot a pair of earrings in the room and soon after we contact the hotel. After 4 days of constant phone calls and emails on our part they told us they didn’t found them although the earrings were 100% in a visible spot in the room from the first moment we called them. I am in the tourist industry and I know that when a client forgets something we give it back! Things don’t disappear just like that… They destroyed our whole Paris experience.",1,1
"Was going to leave 2 stars until I whacked my elbow on the toilet roll holder in their tiny bathroom!  Booked a city view on Agoda and was given a garden view which was half the price at the time. If I wanted a garden view I would have booked it...totally pointless staying in this hotel if you have anything other than the Eiffel tower view which is what I thought I was booking! Rooms are tiny! Bathroom is miniture! GYM IS SHOCKING! One leg curl machine, one leg extension machine and one chest press machine with random dumbells up to 10kg i.e. 3k 6k 7k 10k. Sure it had a running machine if that's your thing but I've seen better gyms in one star hotels.  Room service came knocking at 9.30am and were then clattering outside the room servicing the opposite room for the next hour",1,1

Without apologizing, staff audicioulsly suggested that my sister and mom should wait at my room while they wait for staff to begin preparing the suite. After a long travel day and with a short time in Paris, my mom needed to rest immediately. I felt that Pullman Paris Eiffel charged and was willing and ready  take an outrageous amount of money from me, but it did not satisfy its end of the bargain by not preparing the room  and having it ready at the time they promised it to be, at checkin. I can live with the fact that, per my experience, the hotel’s staff merely wanted my money and not provide friendly",1,1

We called one by ourselves which obviously arrived in a few minutes and who confirmed the absurdity of what the receptionist reported; when on our return to the",1,1

I speak a little French, but when someone is angry and yelling at you, it's confusing, so I can only guess at my ""offense."" Interestingly, my husband was permitted, and this leads me to wonder if my race may have been a factor. I can only guess as the angry security person only yelled and never helped me understand what I did wrong.  I would advise staying at the Hotel Eiffel Seine. It is only a block away, is very clean, is reasonably priced and . . . wait for it . . . no one yells at you!",1,1
"We had a trip booked and fully paid for July of 2020. Covid made us cancel/reschedule. The hotel said they would give us credits for the stay, to just call when we were ready to reschedule. Every time we tried they said “send it in an email” we did over and Over and OVER for 3 months!!! Well they never did it so we had to use our own money to rebook somewhere else. I called and told the reception desk twists been going on, she took my messages and she said she’d hand the manager the message and they’d call back within 24 hours. NOPE!  I even called their corporate office, who said they sent the information to their hotel manager and he would contact me. Nope! Never did! DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL!!! They lie, their customer service is the worst, and they literally stole my money!",1,1

Beware of booking on a 3rd party site. My wife booked on hotels.com and prepaid for a balcony Eiffel Tower view room. We prepaid and had  a guaranteed room type. When we arrived they said we didn’t not have a reservation at their hotel. When we showed our confirmation email they suddenly found our reservation but told us our room type was not available. They offered us the cheapest room possible for the same price we paid for the best room they offered. If they don’t want to honor the prices on 3rd parties then they should choose not to participate. Luckily we were able to get a refund from hotels.com and go to a nicer hotel down the street called Rayz with a balcony view of the Eiffel Tower and rooftop. Stay at Rayz and not this hotel.,1,1
"If you want to stay next to Eiffel Tower, no hotel has better location than Pullman but what a pity when they are not able to serve you properly! It’s a huge hotel which existing staff is not able to manage. Reception staff is always busy and no one pick up the phone, rooms may have fault and you just have to run to the reception for anything you may need.",1,1
This is not a good hotel. It is actually a hot mess. It takes over one hour to order food and at least 30-40 minutes just to get a drink. Definitely the worst hotel I have stayed in in Paris. Bad reviews to viking River cruises for putting us here.  The location is decent but it is ridiculous to stay in such a bad hotel in Paris when there are so many options.,1,1

On my arrival at 1 PM (which was announced) only one room was ready, I had to take a business call while asking my daughters to keep silent for 3 hours. (2) I had to call reception multiple times to ask when the second room was finally going to be ready. (3) No parking was available (hotel description stating otherwise). I had to assertively ask reception to find a solution to park my car. No replacement solution offered pro-actively. (4) I am a gold member and when I complained again - very angrily at my check-out, I was offered a 150 euros discount off my 1000+ euro bill - whereas I should have been offered at least one of the two rooms for the full stay.

Tried to have a drink in the outdoor restaurant and was told we needed a reservation (there was nobody there). He let us sit but said we would have to move if people with reservations came in. Nobody came to serve us,the manager came over and said we could sit but if someone with reservations came in we'd have to move. We left. How do you not know how many tables and reservations you have? What a jerk. The breakfast people were very nice.",2,1

I'm in what I'd call a twin bed, even though my husband prepaid handsomely for a king bed room. When we told one of the women at the desk this afternoon we thought maybe we'd been given the wrong room, she said, no, that was a king and guests simply push the two beds together to make a king bed. Push the two beds together? Have you ever heard of that? Me, either.",2,1
"Recently my husband and I took a trip to Paris, France. Unfortunately, we booked the Pullman Hotel near the Eiffel tower and had a TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!   During our first hour in our room, someone opened our door without knocking. They ended up leaving right away, and I could not get a good look at them due to me trying to get my dogs away from the door. When addressing it with the front desk, they told me I should have put a sign on the front door saying do not distribute. It turns out that housekeeping opened our door; in my opinion, NO ONE should walk into your room without knocking!!! I do not care if it house keeper or room service; they should always knock! But needless to say, they were unbothered that housekeeping just walked into our room and did not even apologize.",1,1

The lady who checked me in took €100 deposit for incidental which was paid on my card with pin and asked to return at 2.30pm when my room would be ready. I arrived an hour later. Ali was at the reception. Asked that I gave him my card in order to write down the digits, but I declined, stating that a deposit has already been charged, and showed my Revolut statement, so defeats the need... He insisted that there is no record on the system, I showed my receipt. He said he will get my card when I check out the next day.  On 15/07/21 I checked out after 11am.

It is safe to say the hotel relies solely on its location: you get out on your balcony and the Eiffel Tower is there, right in your face! That’s more than awesome. And that’s about it. We got there in the morning and were lucky, our room was ready! We were anxious to see it… and were greeted by a horrible sewage stanch from the bathroom. But we couldn’t change room without losing the view. We thought we could just leave the bathroom door shut. The smell still permeated through the ‘Terre d’Hermes’ we had spritzed everywhere. The room itself was very Ikea-ish. But we were in a Valentine mood and excited to see Paris, enjoy a meal by a great",1,1
On a hot Summers evening (Paris is hot in the Summer) I had to leave my room and go utside to cool down. A/C is so not up to standard. Seemed nice in other respects but all I can remember is the heat. Front desk shrugged thier shoulders -it was not just my room.,1,1
"The facilities in the room and decor were pleasant and met our expectations.  We paid an additional fee for the Eiffel tower view however we were unable to enjoy the view because one of the guests smoked drugs and cigarettes which plumed onto our balcony.  We have a 7 year old daughter who i would not let on there at all, we had to keep the door closed.  We did raise this with reception who offered us a free breakfast!?! We have emailed the parent company twice and had a slack general response that offered no apologies or incentive to return.  Also to add to this we were there at the end of July, the hand sanitizer on every floor was a great idea if they could be bothered to refill them - which was never!!, nobody wore masks it was a joke.  Very disappointed and would advise to",1,1
"I wanted to inform other's that I am being denied a refund or credit. I had made reservations and paid in full on the month of December of 2019. Due to unfortunate circumstances because of the pandemic, I am unable to take the vacation that I had worked hard for and plan for a very long time. I reached out to this hotel, and so did my third party which I made a bundle pack deal with, and they refuse to refund or give me credit for future use, stating that it is their policy. So I'm taking a big loss of $844 without understanding how come, at least credit cannot be given. The tour I had planned and flights have been canceled, the hotel is the only one to NOT credit or refund. I'm hoping that this is not happening to others, as well.  Thank you",1,1
"With COVID19 affecting the entire world & cancellations not in our control, this resort refuses to refund and continue take guests money. They have free cancellations now but didn’t before. BEWARE!!!!",1,1
"I showed the lady at reception my bank and she admitted I’ve already paid, when checking out they told me I had to pay again? And then told Me there was a mistake. Just checked my card to see I’ve been charged again? £1060 down for 2 night stay in this hotel... no one answers emails or the phone so I just have to deal with an extra £537 loss.... brilliant.",1,1
"I am so sad to be writing this review having previously given this hotel and its in house restaurant a 5* review.  I have previously enjoyed a wonderful, if not magical stay at the Pullman Tour Eiffel however I am so disappointed that my stay this last weekend did not meet up to previous standards.  Checking in was swift and easy. That is the highlight.  Upon reaching our room, I noticed the previous occupants’ room service (a bowl of nuts and a spoon) right outside the door. I didn’t pay much attention.  I entered the room and immediately called reception to request 2 extra pillows (one each for my husband and I as only one each were provided on the bed). They didn’t arrive. An hour or so later, I called again.... no answer from reception, guest services or concierge. I left it",2,1
"Will not respond to cancellation. Think twice about staying at this hotel they are not friendly they only want your money. They charged me twice for my booking and will not return the money. The reception staff are very unprofessional and the manager was rude, when we asked to change rooms",1,1
When we arrived at the hotel we was told that we had paid in advance and asked for our credit card to score any charges the room. On the day we left we paid our bill which was dinner at the hotel restaurant and couple of drinks at the bar. The following day I was promoted to check my bank account after unusual activities and I see that the Pullman had taken two payments the day after we left. I contacted customer services who said because I wasn’t a club member so they couldn’t help me. I then contacted the hotel directly. It was impossible to speak to a anyone that could understand what had happened. I finally spoke to someone who agreed to look into the issue if I emailed all the details. After several more emails I was refunded but only about 80% why? I called again several,1,1
"This is by far the worst hotel concierge service I have encountered, even hotel with lower rankings are better than this.  I was here for Paris fashion week and before I leave I have asked the concierge to help me handle 3 baggages for 3 different brands to pick up, the concierge didn't take it seriously enough and the communication between staffs are so poor that only 1 of them was successfully picked by the brand, 1 is kept at their storage for too long and no one is following up about the DHL pick up requested many times by the brand, another 1 has even gone missing! I have been chasing them everyday via email and the response is super slow, or I can say irresponsible. I cannot believe the concierge service from Pullman can be that poor, I have lost all of my trust in this",1,1
"I’m actually in Paris now as I’m writing this, this morning 9/1 at 845am my door was opened without the bell being ring or door being knocked. In my experiences of staying in so many hotels this is the first time. I immediately then call down to the guest services and they said they looked through the camera cctv and found out it was a cleaner, firstly what if I am actually in the shower or even sleeping naked ? And it’s 845 am most guest would actually be asleep. We checked out after packing due to the feeling of privacy invasion and the lack of security. You actually woke your guest in a shock at 845am in a so call 5 star hotel in Paris not impressive at all.",1,1
"I checked in yesterday with my newly wed wife. This is our first stay in our honeymoon trip. Horrible stay. Checkin was 3 hours late. Nothing works. There is no working AC. It’s 4.30 Am in the night, can’t sleep coz the room is too hot. The mini fridge and the TV don’t work either. The staff doesn’t seem to care at all. Have made over 10 calls to ask them to help. Also paid € 200/- as a security deposit even after paying for the room in full.",1,1
Your workers with there dirty hands are steeling... Paris is not what it use to be.... You guys are a disgrace...  Never going to book this hotel in my life.. This is not right and you guys are trying to block everyone that says something negative about it..own up to your responsibility as a hotel..,1,1
"Myself and my wife stayed there on Christmas and Christmas Eve this year and to be honest, we were very underwhelmed. The view to the Eiffel Tower was stunning of course and the rooms are well equipped but the staff were honestly hopeless. We were delayed about 1.5 hours because of a “technical issue”. The issue was that all the fridges were apparently locked, and they had no idea how to fix it. They have us 2 free drinks at the bar but that’s when the problems really started. We had 2 bottles of champagne we needed to keep cold. As we had no fridge, there response was to bring a bucket of ice to room. The bucket of ice never arrived. They have ice machines on every odd floor - 1,3,5,7 and 9. We stayed on floor 8. I went to 9,7 and 5. The machines appeared to all be on but NONE",2,1

"Spent four nights with staff at Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel. Spent 30 minutes last night with multiple Pullman staff members organising a van transfer to airport for our team for early this morning. Reaching the airport the driver demanded cash - then chased me into the airport yelling. I don’t carry cash. Embarrassing for my clients. Worse - the hotel didn’t answer phone this morning, nor tonight... even had London Pullman try to call them with no answer.",1,1
"I have to say when looking at this hotel it had promise, but it turned out I was very disappointed, the walls are so thin you can hear every noise made, the room above us made so much noise we could not sleep most of the night I mean you can hear everything not good. Our next problem is that some man from security lectured myself and my wife on how to wear our hoodies, I was so upset, if there is a hoodie policy then it needs to be explained when booking rooms at this bad hotel, The best option will be from AccorHotels to sell this hotel off so the brand can keep its good name, if you are reading this please do not stay here.",1,1
"Every time we visited Paris, we always stayed st this same hotel. It is very well located right next to Eiffel Tower. However today we had the worst check in experience. We arrived hotel at 3:30pm, it took over 30 mins to retrieve our booking regardless that we provided the booking voucher & passport. After finally they retrieved the booking, we were told that one room wasn’t ready ... isn’t official check in time at 3pm?! Of course we were quite frustrated and felt annoyed ..we were complaining ... but the staff around was giving us “Annoying Unfriendly” look.  End up we were revenged with a 1st floor room... we were loyal returning guests, I believe we deserve a better service than this.",2,1
"Initially we booked this hotel months in advance and it was paid for before we arrived. The day we arrived at the hotel, which was about noon, we were advised that check in was at 2 pm but they needed to add our credit card for incidentals and also had them “block” a room for us while they held our baggage. After we roamed the city for a couple of hours until our room would be ready, we returned and were told they did not have a room for us but they could give us a room on the second floor with 2 twin beds. We originally paid for a Superior room with an Eiffel Tower view, so needless to say we were extremely upset and frustrated at how the front desk was handling this situation. There were also others in our party and some in the lobby with the same complaints. The front desk",1,1
"We visited a Pullman Paris for the second time, this time my wife was invited to convention in the hotel. When it was time for checkout we noticed 200 euros had been removed from my wifes passport case. During checkout we let a manager on duty know and filled out a complaint, they told us they reach out to us after they mande there investigations. We never heard from them, so we passed by the hotel a couple of days later due to that we passed through Paris 2 more days and it seemed like they hadnt even done an investigation on the case. They sent us another manager just to tell us they were sorry, they had “checked the cameras” and that the housekeeping lady had been with them for a while and never had any similar issue. The “gobernanta” or head of housekeeping of the hotel",1,1
"Booked this hotel as we had stayed here 15 years ago, it was wonderful back then, now its just a heavy group hotel. Breakfast is in a meeting roo.  hostess was super rude, we didn't even try it, we went to a cafe nearby. They gave us a connecting room, where the connecting door is wafer thin, we heard all the shouting next door till 3am. Service/reception super rude in check out. The only good experience was on check in, can't remember the girls name, she wore a blue suit, blond hair, she was the only saving grace. Shame with such a fantastic location, one would think it would not be so desperate to book so many groups/tour groups, makes it feel very cheap. Won't stay there again.",2,1
"We stayed at this hotel as part of a Viking Cruise at the end of a river cruise for two nights.  The hotel is totally lacking in amenities.  There were no drawers or shelves in the closet to put our clothes. The bathtub was so high to get into that it was a health hazard.  I am not handicapped nor overweight, just 5'3"" and was afraid of falling!  The personnel was unhelpful  and it was a disappointment that even front desk receptionists could barely speak English.  I am not an ugly American.  I speak English, Spanish, and some French and realize I am in a foreign country, but this is a large hotel catering to Americans and could do better in their language skills.  It seems Viking makes hotel choices based on the lowest cost to them.  For the following three nights we changed to",2,1
"I stayed 24 hours qt this hotel for a VIP event my company organized. Thus i did not have the chance to live a true experience at this hotel but it was enough to convince me not to stay again. The rooms not only mine, i confirmed with my colleagues, smell like cigarettes but in fact it is coming from the sewage system in the bathroom. Even thought they came to drop some chemical substance in the drain, the smell persisted to the extent that my clothes smell too. One of my colleagues was awaken during the night due to the smell. I personally slept with the window opened which obviously made the room very noisy so i could not sleep. Some people may mot be bothered by this smell but my advice is not to stay at this hotel as it feels like an unhealthy room environment.",1,1
"The location is about all this hotel has got going for it. On arrival we knew the check in was 3pm and fully prepared for that arriving at 12pm. There was a lot of traffic in reception and no real organisation or clear direction on where to check in having a few desks scattered in the middle of the room and staff milling about. The lady who checked us in, whilst friendly enough wanted to tell us all about her recent visit to London and failed to give us any information about breakfast times, or any of the amenities the hotel obviously didn’t want to offer. When we came back to the hotel, another lady who was clearly training another member of staff, and so seemed a little distracted, I passed the luggage ticket to her but didn’t give us our room key and so had to ask for it, I",2,1

The hotel was extremely modern and clinical. the bedrooms had no draws to put your things only plenty of room for computers definitely totally unromantic, more like where business people would stay overnight.  The bar had a fantastic view of the Eiffel Tower we went there twice for a drink and were served buy a very, very  rude drink waiter (middle aged with glasses).  He was  so rude to us, it was as though if you were not a big tipper you were viewed as a second class citizen and he completely looked down his nose at us. we did complain about him, but it fell on deaf ears. All I can say is that I have travelled to many, many places and have never stayed in a Hotel as awful as this, totally",2,1
"Pullman Paris Tour Eiffe - Disappoints!  My wife and children traveled from Australia in October booking two rooms, room 636 & 637 with four guests in total at the Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel and this has to be the worst stay in a hotel she has ever stayed in.   Customer service at the hotel from the time we arrived is of a 0 star. I’ve traveled to many hotels in my own country and around the world and this has to be the worst service and hotel standard from all areas that she has experienced.   A small but important service is to provide complimentary water in rooms; there was one complimentary water bottle per room?!   We booked two rooms with 4 guests. That’s fine, called the front desk to ask if would could please have an extra two on arrival for the kids and it took them over",1,1
"The location of the hotel is great and very convenient. However, for how expensive the hotel is the service is horrible. The room service button did not connect me to room service, which is fine, but i asked if I could be transferred to the room service number. They said they could not transfer me and that i had to dial a number. The phone rang and no one answered as I waited on the line for 10 minutes. Then, I went downstairs and asked if I could just place the order at the bar or front desk. The guy that worked there literally told me to get uber eats instead. Additionally, their keys often deactivate, they could not put a cot in our room for our friend because the room was “too small for it” (it was not) and she had to sleep on the floor because there was no space in the bed.",1,1
"If you're looking to be close to the Eiffel Tower, this hotel will suit you. However, if you're expecting great customer service, this is not the place for you. The staff are passive in responding to issues and really don't care about your overall experience. The proximity to the tower was great. It's less than 5 minutes from the hotel.  We had a balcony with a view of the tower, but there were no chairs/tables for you to actually sit out and enjoy the view, which was disappointing. The walls are very thin. We could hear clear conversations of the room next to us and the outside noise is very clear.  Also, the included breakfast wasn't worth it. There are other restaurants (including Frame, which is connected to the hotel) to choose from. The buffet was very chaotic and had the",2,1
This was my first and last stay at the Pullman Hotel chain.   I came on business and was greeted by a grumpy receptionist who did not understand a word I said.   I went to the room. Instead of a double bed as I requested there were two singles. I ordered room service and was told it takes 20 mins - in reality it took 1 hour so I ate very late.   The safe broke down and my passport was stuck inside. They took 30 minutes to send someone when i rang.   I asked for my room to be cleaned and they left the food tray in my room. I rang to ask them to remove after a whole day and they promised to send someone but nobody came. My room smelt bad as a result.   WORST of all I was staying for business and in the morning I asjed the nan who flags taxis for the hotel to help me. He refused,1,1
"Viking Cruise selected this hotel to begin our European river cruise.  The staff was capable, but there were too few staff members and the lines were very long.  Breakfast service was a bright spot--good food and friendly staff.  I was surprised the desk was not willing to have small Euro bills and coins on hand to facilitate sightseeing.  The most disappointing thing to happen is that some of my wife's jewelry was stolen from our room.  Another member of the cruise party reported to us that some money was stolen from her purse in the room.  There is a safe in the room, so if you stay at this hotel, be sure to put everything of value in it even if you are only leaving a short time.",2,1
Con: It was my first time in Paris. We went to check in early and had to wait for a queue long time. I’m surprised hotel like this should have many desks for check in out. Staff were not helpful and not polite at all even so staff at the entrance. We went there which was on occasion that polite was blocking the road and only one way to go the hotel but either polite in Paris not helpful and we rung reception asking for another solutions or give us different direction which was awful couldn’t helpful. We had to sit and even beg for police to let’s part not only that we were exhausted from journey and traffic was overwhelming but we still sit in the ca and try to talked to the polite can’t even speak English. It was really hard to understood each other. Until they got a call off,2,1
This hotel was a location done by a tour that we extended for 2 extra days. First the elevators were 50% not working. Room was not cleaned until after 5 pm. So if you are tired from an all day tourist trip you don’t want to wait for them to clean. The clean room please tag was put out before 7am. The taxi service outside hotel was really a problem that was addressed with hotel with no resolution. Restaurant food in evening and bar not good and service awful!  Breakfast was good. Bathroom was not cleaned completely. Tub still had scum from morning shower upon return room being cleaned after 5 pm. Bath clothes not provided for each day of stay so I had my own of which the cleaning staff took. All was addressed with Management and we were offered some wine or champagne. REALLY,1,1
"Booked a suite with Effel tower view  1,5 months in advance. Arrived in the night with 2 kids. Reception offer only 1 flor angeled room. With ""Effel tower view"" - in reality you see a bit of tower just from one window. Huge difference between photos and reality.   To upgrade room reception offers to pay additionally 1000€ for 4 nights.  Than block 800 euro for any cases🤷‍♂️ instead of just card reservation like usual.   Kids want to sleep and when we entered the room the bed wasn't made. So we have to go at 1pm back to reception to ask made a bed.  They did, but forget duvet cover. All this at 1 am after long trip.  There is no enough towels and slippers for all of us in the room.   A lot of negative emotions. Will never choose again or recommend to someone.",1,1
Lots of family from all over the world converged on París for my cousins 50th birthday and the bar shut to residents at 1am ; this is poor. We will not be staying here again. We were ejected to a very small outside área .... not very hospitable!!,1,1
"Off to a bad start by having to ask three times over the course of 2hrs if our room was ready. Bar staff too busy chatting amongst themselves to serve. Told they weren’t serving cocktails (OK?) so had a warm glass of white wine presented to me and when I complained got asked if I wanted to put ice in my €15 a glass of wine (which I left).  Got back from our first night late in the evening to find room hadn’t been touched by a cleaner, so bed unmade, no clean towels, tea and coffee not replaced.  Buffet breakfast is of poor quality given we have paid €375 a night it is probably the worst value for money you are likely to ever get.   Luckily we still had a great time in Paris but the hotel was well below par give the cost. The general manager here needs to get a grip on the place",2,1

On top of that, the bathrooms are not only small, but also downright disgusting. It takes forever to drain the water in the basins and toilet.   We tried complaining about the same on our first day, but no action was taken. Then we tried again the next day, and they assured us that they would send someone to fix it. But again, no results. On the third day, we went to them and demanded that they either change our room or fix the issue immediately. But so far, nothing has been fixed and no action has been taken.  This disastrous stay experience has spoiled our entire trip. We cannot comfortably get ready in the morning and",1,1

The lower floors on the rear of the building face a close office building, and the frontside faces a football/soccer field. They play all-day, every day, so it can become quite noisy. Fortunately we brought a white noise machine, but it would've been more difficult to sleep had we not brought it.  The view is nice, but the location is just okay. Most of the stuff you're going to want to see as a tourist is closer towards the Louvre, but if you get a room with a balcony and Tower view, then it's a pretty nice spot to be. However, the rooms themselves were just okay. Kind of small, water pressure is just okay. We found chapstick and a couple of socks from previous guests, indicating that the maids",2,1

I checked the email confirmation they sent us and at no point did it state the original card was needed. As we did not have the original card they refused to check us in, after an early flight and an extreme heatwave we were keen to be in our room.

The customer service is a disgrace, we arrived very tired after more than 15 hrs of travelling from South America, we had booked our stay through a travel agency more than 4 months ago, everything was paid in advance.

I am appalled at the leadership and management style of this hotel.  I am celebrating my birthday and I wanted to do this in a hotel facing the Eiffel Tower.  Its not my first trip to Paris but I wanted this one to be special.  I couldnt decide to splurge on the day before or the day of my birthday as the hotel is a bit on the steeper end of a travel budget.  I had two browsers opened for booking on two different days.  I inadvertently selected a nonrefundable fare for the second day also immediately after booking the first day.  It was only 4 minutes until we saw the mistake.  We called the booking agent and they called the hotel.  Mistakes happen to anyone as we are human but recognizing this so quickly has no relevance to them.

We arrived late in the afternoon on April 1. It was a warm day and I am guessing the temperature in our room on the 9th floor was 85 degrees when we arrived. My husband called the front desk to report that the AC was not working. He was told that the hotel did not have AC. We opened the windows to let in some fresh air and discovered there were no window screens and the windows swung wide open. Apparently the Parisians are not worried about people falling out of windows. It was necessary to keep the windows open even in the rain.   We ate dinner at the hotel restaurant. Apparently it was some kind of artsy fusion place and the only thing that had any appeal was a hamburger—if you want to call it that. The bun was normal size but the hamburger part looked like and had the,1,1

We came back at 11.00am and it still was not ready. Came back an hour later and it still was not ready. Despite having two deliriously tired kids we did not get into our room until 1.30pm (following my persistence). The hotel staff were very rude and did not care about our long flight and the fact I had two very tired young children.  Unfortunately our dealings with the staff did not improve during our stay. Every time we approached them they were quite rude. The concierge was never there and when they were, they did not appear very knowledgeable.

We asked to have a sofa bed ready when we checked in at 4 p.m., but the hotel hadn’t done it yet when we came back from dinner at 11:00 p.m. We called twice and the front desk said to do soon. But no services for over 30 minutes. The lady at the front even laughed when we called the second time. Eventually, I had to go down to the front desk and asked again. Then at midnight, a guy came and made a bed without bringing pillows and blanket. This is my 4th time in Paris. Thank you for making my worst experience ever in Paris. Never stay here again and will spread the word.",1,1

Reception sent the security person. Nothing  I called again the reception. Reception sent the security person. Nothing.  I went down to reception for another room. The answer was: “we are sorry. We are fully booked”  I asked to make an official complaint and the hotel do not have a process for it.  I was shocked for the lack of interest and the lack of professionalism of the Pullman team.

"Suite booked for one night - not ready when we arrived, one hour after advertised check in time.  However biggest let down was breakfast.  Queued for 10 mins to even get in.  Shown to a table - filthy but waiter just shrugged his shoulders!   Then the food.  Or rather lack of food, bowls, etc.  Breakfast should be a big deal at a hotel like this- do not stay here",2,1
"My boyfriend (now fiancé) stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and were constantly disappointed.   The check-in process was difficult and not efficient as they required the same credit card we used to originally book hotel from 6 months ago - this was resolved by us searching through statements from 6 months ago to prove we aren’t “frauds”.  My partner at the time also organised to propose to me on our balcony facing Eiffel Tower. As a result, he had requested + confirmed that day for the room to be decorated for when we check-in which did not happen. He was extremely disappointed and had to sort this out with hotel manager who gave 2 free drinks (definitely does not make up for ruining an engagement proposal plan) and a quick decoration while we ate dinner that day which was",1,1
"We're staying here while vacationing on our honeymoon. Upon arrival, hotel staff immediately took our bags into a side room off the lobby, (even though our room was ready). The following morning I found my luggage had been tampered and items missing. When I went downstairs to the lobby to speak with a manager, I was approached by a female staff member whom wasn't epathetic. At first she wouldn't tell me her title or if she was the manager. She was not a manager. She advised the manager was away and would contact me upon their return. We've made a second request but still haven't had contact with a manager on day 4 of our 5 day stay. We learned from staff that there are no cameras located in the room off the lobby that our luggage had been pulled into.  The manager does not care",1,1
"Very bad service! I booked 6rooms , My guests had to wait 2 hours for check in. With The diner they forgot half our table, so we couldn’t eat at The same time. They took a pre-authorisation on My creditcard , normaly with the checkout they release it. Until today (9 days after checkout they have still blocked 5000 Euro on my card!!!! They don’t understand their own system. They don’t respond on emails. Watch out for this hotel!! Better book somewhere else, really really very unprofessional. A rip-off",1,1
"What a pity, because this place has it all. Nice rooms, wonderful view on the Eiffel Tower and good restaurant. But the main problem, is that twice a week, on their top terrace on the top floor, huge parties are given till one thirty in the morning. So if you are looking for peace and quiet, you won't find it here. The music blares on and thunders down to the rooms. It is impossible to sleep. The parties happen very often and even on weekdays and Sundays!  And even if you ring the reception to complain, they say they can't do anything. Very disappointing indeed. Do not go there if you want a good nights sleep.",2,1
"I am beyond disappointed at the level of service my husband and I received at Accors Pullman Eiffel Tower hotel. This was our second stop of our two week Anniversary trip after staying at the Ampersand Hotel in London (which was an absolute amazing stay and experience) and we were most excited about staying here because it was a recommendation from our family. We choose the superior room with the Eiffel Tower view. When it was time for bed we noticed an insect on the ceiling , then we noticed another one, then it flew on my husband , and I have a sensitivity to mosquitoes. As we began to try to kill them we saw another one. At that point we had enough and we went down to the service desk and explained the situation . The service desk was so insensitive to the fact that there",1,1
"This hotel is trading on its location, purely and simply. It is at best a 3*, if not a 2*. An Ibis Budget would have been better. The property is austere looking with grubby, overpriced rooms. The worse thing of all is the incompetent staff. They are all utterly miserable and unhelpful. You arrive and leave with the feeling that they're doing you a favour by being present. Absolutely horrible hotel. Accor should be ashamed of itself with this property.",1,1
"We have used this hotel five time over a number of years, always been good. This time arrived at Noon took 2 hours to check in, three people had to be involved, We booked one room for 4 night, they stated there were 2 rooms for the same people same time, advised they would refund, later advised they would not even though we only had 1 confirmation. Daughters met up with us in Paris, took the rest of the day to get them to use the room we did not book and could not get a refund on.  On the second day our room was accessed and a wine bottle was dropped onto the floor, Must have been a special bottle as it opened itself whilst we were out. Our credit card went missing, but after 4 attempts by phone and 2 visits downstairs they sent a cleaner to clean up. I day later.... When we",1,1
"Absolutely horrible experience.  We waited for 3 hours post the official check in time. Then too we received the room after waiting at the reception counter for an hour and half straight.  Few of the staff members are really good. Chef Vivega (Chef Vivekanad) & Chef Andrew are good and asssisted in giving good food (we are 100% vegetarians), and a couple of guys at the front office were helpful, but otherwise the staff isn't very helpful and assisting.  Better to try Mercure (part of of Accor group like Pullman) just few steps away. Here, you will pay quite a bit for an awesome view, decent rooms and horrible service.  I wouldn't recommend this hotel for stay for sure.",2,1
"I’m leaving 1 star due to the fact that my card was charged for the deposit upon my departure despite using a different card to pay the balance. My stay was during April 11-15. I reported the issue immediately and was told it takes one to two weeks to be taken off my credit card. I waited and the charge was still on my credit card so I called to follow up. When I spoke to someone at the front desk, he told me it looks like my credit card was mistakenly charged and that I would be refunding. Was told again that the refund would take one to two days. I emailed the hotel’s email for a confirmation several times and I STILL HAVE YET TO GET ANY RESPONSE AND MY CREDIT CARD IS STILL BEING CHARGED. This has been such a frustrating process and I already disputed the charge with my credit",1,1
"Accidentally made a mistake when booking this hotel via the Accor app. Tried for 2 days to contact them. My emails were ignored, they don’t answer the phone. The Accor central reservations team said the hotel could change my booking at manager’s discretion but they decided NOT to do this, leaving me $1000 out of pocket. They told me to contact my insurance company. Nice huh?  To boot, I’ve been an Accor Club Platinum and Gold member for years. I have never made such a simple mistake, but clearly this hotel doesn’t value loyal members and guests. Forget asking them for assistance!!",1,1
"Probably I was having too high expectations on this hotel which located right next to the Eiffel Tower, but after staying there for 5 nights, I actually felt disappointed and not sure whether I will return nor recommend to friends at all.",1,1
"Although this is super close to the Eiffel Tower, and the major Salesforce office, we won’t be staying here again. Major is it’s unbearably hot. No AC capability in the winter, and our floor and room were so uncomfortably warm, it made sleeping so difficult. Even opening the windows and ensuring all heating was turned off didn’t help. For goodness sakes, it’s 2019, get operating thermostats in the rooms!  Suite layouts are odd, as the wet area is separated from the shower. So you’re walking through the living area to get to the toilet. Doesn’t make it convenient in the middle of the night.   On the plus side, front desk personnel were very nice. But unfortunately couldn’t fix the heating issue.",2,1
"What a SHAME!!!!  We come in Paris as our first city for our honeymoon and we couldnt wait to leave this hotel.   Firstly we arrived at 4pm and the room wasnt ready yet, ok its something we can deal with. I sent an email explaining it was our honey moon and I was hoping to have even a card with the congratulations on it...nothing  The breakfast restaurant was packed as it was NYE period. customers like us lining up to get some eggs because there was ONLY 1 Chef cooking for maybe 200 people. He couldnt even speak english so after we waited 25 minuts we asked for a veggie omelette and we got ham inside...THANKS  Second day we decided it was better just get out somewhere else...  On the top of that they didnt even bother to put body soap in the room (I think even in 1 star hotel",1,1
"Unless you order a superior / executive class then yeah may be they will serve you better and got a nicer view.  we pay for this hotel for $500 per night for a deluxe room which we expected something nice from the hotel service & VIEW. THERE IS A REASON WHY YOU WANT TO BOOK THIS HOTEL.  Everyone wants to book this hotel to ENJOY THE VIEW. we cant even ask for higher floor or nicer view that we wish to have in our room. the purpose people book a room here is for the fantastic view. when we ask the front desk to get me a room with nice view, she told me that i can go out from the hotel you can see full eiffel tower. WTH?  i stay somewhere else also can come to eiffel tower area to see full eiffel tower what?!  what i want is a room with eiffel tower view. that is the purpose i",1,1
"Great location, truly pathetic service. Front of desk, dont care once you have been checked in. Organising rooms, forget it!! Over 5 nights, we had issues for 4 of them. Overcharge on check in, incorrect cards for doors, unable to get doors opened in interconnecting rooms, 1 hr to print for vouchers for tours, just hopeless. Just don't do it !!!",1,1
"Just left the Pullman Eiffel Tower 28/12 following 5 night stay.  While the location is great, the front of house staff is a disgrace. They are not helpful at all.  Firstly we were charged over AUD$4,000 initially then they tried to tell us that the transaction didn’t go through although our bank told us and told the staff at the Pullman directly that it had (this is now in dispute with the bank and Pullman), meanwhile we still had to pay this amount again (so down $4,000 on first day of holiday!!). Even asking help to print vouchers booked online seemed to be too hard or not important enough for the staff to assist with. Upon checkout (which we wanted to settle the night before as we had an early departure the next morning) we confirmed with the check-out staff if everything",1,1
"Best part of this hotel is the 30 second walk to the foot of the Eiffel Tower. Truly right there.  Everything else has been mediocre for a hotel of this caliber. The staff are friendly, but not very helpful. Breakfast is tasty, but very small and gets busy quickly. And the entire 9th floor had no hot water on our second day. Overall, our stay was good, but it felt more like a fancy hostel than a business hotel. I would not recommend this hotel in a city like Paris with so many other options.",2,1
"Waited a week before writing this review - was going to provide a good score based on the quality of the rooms and excellent location.   What dampened the experience for me was the clueless staff. Got charged twice on one card for the same dinner. Repeated the problem to 3 different persons at reception, no one could resole the issue or provide a refund.   In the end, got told to email them. Still waiting for a response.",2,1
"If you are looking for a great view of the Eiffel Tower, stay here.  If you want anything else, do not stay here.  This is a “4 Star” hotel.  It’s really a 2 star hotel, which they’ve renovated to try and make it a 4 star hotel.  They’ve not succeeded.  It is very overpriced.    In my opinion, it’s well worth the price for the view of the Eiffel Tower if that is what you are after.  Our view was amazing.  I’ll upload some pics from the balcony.  Let me just say though, you can save a lot of money and stay elsewhere.  You can take great photos around the Eiffel tower anyway, so is it really worth the money for a not great hotel?  I don’t think so.  Am I glad I stayed here?  Yes. Would I do it again, heck no.  Likes – They give you a phone to use with international calling and",1,1
"We stayed at the Pullman with our cruise and an additional 2 day. Other then a great location it’s about all it has going for it, we were so excited but our excitement was dashed once we opened the room door: Internet was spotty Bathroom not much bigger then an airline restroom Heat in the room was unbearable unless the window was open No space for luggage, no where to unpack if you are in the room for very long Will not recommend",2,1
"I have travelled many many times overseas over the years both for work as well as vacation and never have I had an experience like this one. About 3 months prior to us leaving Australia we made a booking through our agent. There was an issue with the booking and through the stuff up, we were offered an upgrade however the stipulation was that we had to pay upfront and on that day to secure. Which we did. That was about 8 weeks out. All secured and paid for, we arrive in Paris only to be told that although there was a booking, it had to be paid for as they had no records showing payment had been made. Pullman asked us to present a bank statement to prove otherwise. Well clearly we don’t travel with our bank statements!!! So they insisted we put another $4500 on my credit card",1,1
"Wi-fi did not work; tried to pay 9 euros/day for faster wi-fi but was told that didn't work either; wi-fi finally came active on 3rd day, then went down again. Paid deposit so we could use minibar, but they never unlocked it, even with 4 trips to front desk. Was told that tech staff would come to room and that genl. mgr. would contact me, but neither happened. Waited 35 minutes in cafe without getting any service, finally cafe mgr. said he'd wait on us, then he went back to texting on his phone, so we left. Long lines for breakfast in basement, and longer lines for only cook making hot food, who was interrupted by orders for room service. When we checked out, they tried to charge for minibar (never unlocked in 5 days) and for wi-fi that didn't work. This place desperately needs",1,1
"Great location, modern furniture. Mostly rude reception staff, with very limited English ability.  But my big gripe. When you pay more than 350€/night, you expect proper working air conditioning. I have stayed all over the world in hotels and somehow even hotels charging less than 100€ per night can provide their guests with proper air conditioning.  On our first night, our room on the 11th floor was incredibly hot. We reported, and a technician was send to our room. He informed us that the hotel’s heating system had already been turned on for winter and the a/c system could no longer provide cool air to the room. Our only option was to put off the air conditioning and rather open the window.  However, this meant that the sounds from the loading dock below kept us awake together",1,1
"For location, this hotel really can't be beat as you are literally across from the Tour Eiffel.  The room was clean and nicely furnished in a modern style and the bathroom with the rain shower was great since it reminded us of home. The people there, esp the bellmen were friendly and helpful.  There were however big disappointments, first of which was I felt very deceived since on their site when I booked, it showed a room where the balcony looks straight to the Tour Eiffel.  What we got was a view of a soccer field where kids/adults were playing pretty much all day and we had to fully go out to the balcony to be able to see it to the right.  There wasn't a cute little bistro set as in the pictures either.  Also, when you first walk into the hotel, there is a strong stench of",2,1
"The system this hotel uses to check guests in, is ridiculous.  They have no organized hotel clerk desk.  We arrived at 10:00 PM and waited until past 11:00 PM to get our room.  The clerk on duty was clueless and overwhelmed.  We requested a room with a shower because my wife has mobility issues - they didn't even know which rooms had showers and which rooms had baths.  The room they put us in (no showers available - just baths) had water running in the walls all night - couldn't get to sleep for hours!  The breakfast buffet is marginal at best.  We went down the street to a café for croissants and coffee - much better choice  About the only good thing about the hotel was the location next to the Eiffel Tower was nice and the room was clean.",2,1
"Check-in was very lengthy! Barely any attention was paid to the growing line. We got asssigned our room only to hear a continued rattling sound. Report this to the front desk, only half and hour and two calls later did a staff member pop in for a minite then out and mentioned a technician needed to come by. We waited again with no action, had to leave for a dinner reservation, front desk promised this would be fixed after our dinner. Came back over two hours later to no resolution. Called front desk again, had to convince them that we could not sleep in a room with a unknown rattling sound. 20 minutes later the come back and put us in an Assessible room, fine, the bathroom was basically a big room no shower walls, fine, the problem was the whole entire bathroom and even toliet",1,1
"Yes, the Eiffel Tower is right there. But that's not enough reason to stay here.  1. The check-in and check-out is completely disorganised. Arrive around check-in time and it's complete chaos.  2. There are a large numbers of tours, cruises that stay here. The lobby can get extremely busy as the large groups gather.  3. I don't speak French but you shouldn't pretend I'm not saying anything. Two members of housekeeping knocked on my door. I told them I wasn't ready for cleaning and as I was in the middle of asking for more water, both walked away. Literally was standing at my door talking to myself. I travel a lot and I've never experienced such rudeness.  4. I paid for upgraded wifi. After it tested to be very slow, I called guest services. Instead of sending someone to inspect",1,1
"The Pullman was the last stop for my wife and I on a ten day France/Spain vacation. For the price, it was very much a let down, but also lacked any really redeeming quality, in my opinion. We stayed at five different hotels on this trip, including another in Paris, and this was by far the least memorable. Upon entering we proceeded to the check-in line. A person who seemed to be a manager approached us after a couple minutes and simply said hello. You’d think he would know what we were there for considering our backpacks and that we were in the check-in line, however it became apparent after an awkward silence that we needed to state our intentions. Aside from that, there was no welcome to the hotel, or any sort of pleasantry. We were then escorted to another check-in table.  As",2,1
We have stayed here for 2 nights on fri and  Sat night. Our room was clean and lovely. Location was brilliant. My issue is that we came to Paris for the first time and the hotel is so busy that there is no real customer service. You are left to your own devices and it's always manic at the reception so we didn't ask for any resturants help or any advice on where to go etc.   We used the room phone and that was brilliant and really helped us find our way round.   Massive issue - we stayed on the 5th til 7th oct 18 and the authorisation on my debit card of aprox £250 has still not been released and I've emailed the hotel twice with no response. It is now the 17th oct. Hugely disappointed hence the low score  .,2,1
"Yesterday we arrived at the Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel to check in. We had to wait in a queue for over 40 minutes to check in. It was hot and horrible. The lady at the check in, when we finally got there (Nari) was wonderful and went out of her way to assist us. However we paid 380 euro for a bed that was like concrete. Seriously the worst bed I have slept in over my 35 years of travelling. Sleeping on the cobblestones would have been preferable and probably more comfortable. We had an early morning flight and there was a partly going on above our room so lots of stomping as they  danced, topped off by the noise of staff rearranging the room and dragging tables and chairs to rearrange the room after the party finished. A pity there is no such thing as try the bed before you",2,1
"We arrived at the hotel and it was so overcrowded that the lift could not be used as there was a long line waiting to go up.. We were told to go up one flight of  stairs which turned out to be four sets of stairs and 2 floors up with our cabin bags .and the old people were exhausted, half way up. Each time we phoned guest service from our room, the person could not understand English and we phoned 4 times and after 1 hour, the hangars we requested  did not come. My partner went to ask the concierge directions and she was so rude, they have a big problem with their women staff they are absolutely horrible and treat you like idiots. I am a woman and if it was my hotel would have kicked them out long ago.it is mainly that they cant understand English and answer all the wrong things",1,1
We encounter very rude service and uncomfortable stay. Staff were not helpful. Overly rated abs crowded. This property is not 4 or 5 star. I have to wait so long even I’m gold Accor member. It’s a mess.,1,1
"Arrived at the hotel to find chaos everywhere, weren’t too sure where to check in but finally did only to get told we wouldn’t have our King bed, garden and tower view but just two single beds and tower view only. Was told we can either have the King bed with no view or the single beds with a view (still no garden view) so we pushed our two singles together for the view of the tower. We were also told that I would have to pay nearly £200 additional “holding fee” that I would get bet back when I left... this made me short of spending money but this was “essential” apparently.  The pictures make out that you get a table and chairs on the balcony, you do not, which was annoying due to the amount you pay per night.  Other than this, the view was sensational (if you weren’t looking",2,1
"Do not recommend. Abosuletey worst service. Paid city taxes on check in was told we could only pay cash and our master card was not accepted.On checkout we were forced to pay them again as we couldn't show a receipt and were called liars to ever paying them. The person to charge kept repeating ""it's only 20 euros"" which is not the point. We advised name of the staff member but they all share the name badges so every day they have a different name. Refused to check cctv. Absolute do not recommend. Will be contacting the pullman h.o to esculate. Email sent with no response after a month.",1,1
Having spent 3 weeks in Provence before staying at this hotel we had an idea of the standard of accommodation to expect from something rated 4 stars. This place clearly rests on its location.  Our room was filthy. The pillows were absolutely awful & they do not offer a suite of pillows - what is in your room is all you get. The breakfast area has been designed by some work experience kid & there simply is not enough space in the restaurant for the number of people staying at the hotel. One of our biggest concerns was how an elderly person could deal with the shower over bath. It is a big step to get over the top of the bath on a slippery surface. Very dangerous.  The rooms are awful to be in too. Poorly designed & ugly.  Please go elsewhere. Do not stay in this hotel. We went to,1,1
"Do not stay there ! They will give you hell! My series of worst services here are:   1.)   I was denied to check in early despite my early request, so I had to go out.  2.)   On my way back, I lost my way because of FIFA parade and I called the hotel, but no staff took the call.  3.)   They mistakenly spelt my name and gave me the wrong room type.  4.)   They mistakenly checked me out 1 day in advance.  5.)   Whenever I followed up with the receptionists for their errors, there was no progress, I had to keep asking for the same old thing!  6.)   When I checked out, they did not return my security deposit of 1.260 euro. So I had to pay both my room rate 1,175.30 euro and 1,260 euro. Is it legal?  7.)   When I returned to Bangkok I had to waste time contacting the ACCOR top",1,1
"checked in late around midnight - receptionist took my credit Card and immediately charged 1 night to it. that night was never deducted from my total 2 nights bill.  when i recognised it, i had to write to Accor Group Pullman and request being Paid me. took time. never got an apology or even a make good for my time and efforts.",1,1

"I wanted to stay here for 3 nights and booked online through their website. Because I wanted to discuss a few things with my partner I booked a refundable rate. A few hours later I wanted to change this to a non-refundable rate to save money. Online this was impossible (you need to make a new booking, then cancel the old). I then contacted Accorhotels.com support. There I was first told it wasn't a problem, a few minutes later I was told ""computer says no"". I then emailed the hotel directly: no reply. I then sent an email to support. Reply: it is possible, just contact reservations. Sorry but I am tired of being sent around in circles. So I cancelled the booking. Am never staying in a hotel of Accorhotels.",2,1
"We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights as part of a two week tour around Europe.  This hotel was our least favorite of anywhere we stayed.  I booked this hotel due to Eiffel Tower views, and that was the highlight of the stay.  Let me start by saying, this hotel is heavily used by tour groups.  I had seen this in reviews before but did not realize the magnitude until arrival.   Viking river cruises, Gate1 travel, etc all use this hotel.  This means there is always a line at reception making it difficult to get anything done.  One reason we booked this hotel was because of the advertised cell phone that came with the room.  We did not have one in our room when we checked in and it took 24 hours before they were able to locate one only to have it not work because it had been reported",2,1
"First, let me say that I didn’t have any false beliefs before I went that this was a 5 star hotel. I knew exactly what I was getting. This is a 3 star hotel at best! My stay here confirmed that belief. The only reason to stay here is for the location. The views of Eiffel is amazing. It is literally a 2 minute walk to the tower.  Like I mentioned above, don’t go here thinking you will receive 5 star service. If you want that kind of service with a view, stay at the Shangri La which by the way will cost you around $1000 a night. Upon arrival, the check in is very basic. No hot towel, no welcome drinks, some staff speak English, some doesn’t, no orientation of the room etc.   The breakfast buffet is terrible for 26 euros per person. Don’t waste your money on it. There are plenty of",2,1
"Worst experience I have ever had in a hotel.   We stayed for one night to celebrate our engagement while on holidays in France. I had proposed during the day and stay here was to be special night, I had arranged, flowers, balloons, champagne, fruit platter.  All costing over $1500AUD for one night.   On arrival, 90% of the surprise was missing from the room, we spent several hours waiting for it the fixed instead of enjoying our stay and engagement.   The staff promised the room would be free and then on departure said they never said that.    The manager was rude, had no compassion.   DO NOT BOOK ANY SPECIAL OCCASION AT THIS HOTEL!",1,1
"Well that's basically tye synopsis of the hotel.....Satisfactory!! Long queues for check in, long queues for check out,breakfast bland and uninspired, noisy like a ships horn in the night rang to complain at 15 past midnight was like a foghorn really unpleasant when trying to sleep.",2,1

Was told breakfast was included when it wasn’t, good job I did not fall for that ruse or it would have been added to the bill.",1,1

"Don’t know where to start. We arrived after 2 PM, no room ready, that had been completely paid Iin Advance. Sent to the bar for a comp drink to wait, well after half hour went back to check in which is a real poor set up to start with, still not ready. Finally just took a room that was ready, not comp for the change either. Called housekeeping almost every day of the 5 days we were there   Water, Kleenex, oh n spilled water on the rug, money removed from night stand, also took our room key so had to have those cancelled and get new keys. Upon checking in ones charge card is charged e600, that’s almost $700 US for extras. The breakfast is good. If you eat out smoking everywhere .  Check out not much better. Great location   Restraunt was closed during day!!!",2,1

"With the exception of one young Parisian, Maurice, who organised within 1 hour of our arrival diabetic meds my husband needed, all other reception staff & managers were just plain rude, unhelpful, gave misdirections & shrugged shoulders at any query. I asked about the Big Bus tours & 3 Reception staff said they’d never heard of them. Yet the bus could be seen from our room in the next street. They pretended not to speak or understand English, yet I did hear English being spoken. I did attempt to speak basic French. I had heard that the French could turn their noses up to people of English origins but I never expected them to be so so rude & ignorant. the Pullman is definitely not value for money. If you ever travel to France, remember that you are completely on your own.",1,1
"On the positive side, this hotel has undergone a complete gutting and everything is completely new.  Rooms are large and it feels fresh and modern.  Location close to Eiffel tower also a big plus.  But ... so many drawbacks.  Check-in desk is understaffed and disorganized.  Couldn't get anyone to pick up service line, when they did, they hung up on me.  Internet is so slow it is unusable, if you can even log in.  Breakfast buffet's hot food was barely warm, and both my son and I left with bad stomachs.  Wouldn't let my son who is in a wheelchair use the disabled entrance.  Just so many drawbacks I could not recommend.",2,1

So we went and got something to eat and returned at 14:30, only to be told that our room still wasn't ready. We continued to wait and wait until it was 15:45 and, having been travelling for 36 hours we really just wanted to check in to our room! It still wasn't ready so we were ""upgraded"" to the room we didn't want. The staff member at check in was extremely rude at this point, criticizing us for not having the credit card under which the room was booked 6 months prior (we had the credit card information but not the credit card itself, as it had expired). The turn down service was also terrible. We went out for a full day on",2,1
The worst ever hotel experience! Very long review due to the spoiled anniversary holidays. Me and my wife came to Paris for our wedding anniversary and stayed in this hotel for two nights. Every step of the way starting from check in until check out was a struggle. Upon our arrival to the hotel we had to wait for a long time before being checked in due to the lack of organisation and structure in the lobby. The layout of the check in table is in the centre of the room which makes it impossible for the hotel staff to work on the registration process while communicating politely with the couple or more than one person at a time. One of us had to stand behind his back trying to hear what he was saying and being ignored. The experience is not pleasant. The check in process takes a,1,1
"Only good thing is location. If you visit this hotel in high season, consider yourself on your own with virtually no service provided. Internet is slower than a dial-up day speed Everything you ask for is delayed..from coffee at breakfast to room service to small house keeping stuff. This hotel is definitely not properly staff and the worst thing, they don't givea damn!!? Because Eiffel tower is next door. So unless you have to be next to this icon, just AVOID this place and stay isn a better hotel in Paris next to any metro station.",1,1
"We stayed in Pullman Paris to be close to Eiffel Tower. We had a balcony with great view and obviously we paid dearly for it. What we didn't pay but still got was headache, due to loud noise coming from the party on the floor above. There was loud music, people jumping and we could all hear it in our room. My son who was 20 months old at the time of stay was crying and the hotel couldn't help. The hotel team should have known about the noise & the party. They should have allocated the rooms considering it. Pathetic service.",1,1
"There is no question being able to look out at the Eiffel Tower from the hotel door is a great location. Unfortunately, the second you step into the lobby, you will see that the place is over-run with tour buses, and despite the best intentions of the staff, there clearly isn't the ability to handle that many people. The front desk staff were clearly overworked and overwhelmed.   We have now waited 6 hours for a roll-away bed that was in our reservation and  confirmed by the front desk TWICE. Three phone calls to the front desk - it is coming soon. I get it. they lack the staff to handle this. It would be probably easier for them to just give us another room tonight so my poor child has a place to sleep. We've been traveling all day anyways, so what's the loss of some more",2,1
"We had three rooms booked with 2 rooms arriving a day earlier than the next room. After waiting three hours extra so that the two rooms would be on through same floor, they made sure that the third room would be on the same floor so we would not have to deal with this the next day. Unfortunately, the next day, they made us wait an extra five hours so that a room on the same floor would be ready. However, when we came back, they gave away our room and we were told they would be unable to be on the same floor. They, then told us they charged an extra room under our name for the preceding day. When we assured them we aren’t in two places at once, they asked us to check the extra room and see who exactly was in this mysterious room. After all this confusion over someone who",1,1
Great AC - and it is hot in Paris right now. I realised I didn’t have a hair dryer after I got out of the shower. Called guest services - who insisted that I did. He promptly came to my room (without a hair dryer) to show me where my hair dryer was.  Voila - no hair dryer. The hair dryer was promised in 10 minutes and never arrived. The front desk also argued with me when I checked in. Really frustrating experience...I regularly stay at the Pullman Montparnasse - this hotel didn’t compare at all.,2,1
The hotel has a nice view from the rooms however I booked 2 rooms and they had me waiting for 1 of them for 2 hours without giving me any explanation or offering another location to wait. Totally dissatisfied.,2,1
"I stay here twice per year, and has become a silver member. By Paris standards, this is a nice hotel. But when compared to what you can expect elsewhere, it is pretty disappointing.  I guess due to being silver, my room was upgraded at my last visit. So i had a balcony looking onto the Eiffel. Just lovely! The breakfast is also good, nice variety and mostly good quality. Love the personally made omelettes.  So why complain? Well almost every time i visit, there are issues. This time around, they tried to charge me xtra for breakfast, when it was already included in my rate at the time of booking. I got an email contact (presumably at head office), and it was resolved. Or so i thought. When i checked out, they still tried to charge me for one night, despite a written email which",2,1
"First impression was good- clean, nice design, small but usable room in Paris! Paid for the view, which really is great. But when we booked, the advertisement showed a picture ""putting your feet up on the balcony with view toasting with a glass of champagne"". NO CHAIRS OR TABLE on balcony. Very misleading.  After 2 nights things were falling off the bathroom wall (glued on). Who was stupid enough to glue the sanitary-napkin holder at nose level?",2,1
"Most rooms do not have a view on the Eiffel Tower but a view on an ugly dark backyard. Too expensive for what it is. No hot water to shower. TV broken. No customer friendly staff, they treat arrivals as another number, clearly not caring weather you come back. Rip off of families with small children, so they handle small kids the same way as if youwould book for 4 adults.They force you to pay for two rooms although standard rooms very spacious claiming safety. If you do not wish to ruin your stay, stay away from this one.",1,1
"Pullman Eiffel sells on location only. due to its good location near Eiffel, it really does not bother with customer satisfaction. internet not working at first and slow - reported but they could not resolve. TV not working - reported and they sent technicians after hours and numerous calls. After giving feedback to the Pullman management, they replied that Pullman's hotel is not the only one affected - some frivolous excuses - because after i demanded room change, that other room has no TV problem. So Pullman and its management really dont care about customers and their feedback. they don't fill mini bars, don't upkeep cracks on glass windows, etc.. the saving grace I guess is that they are renovating the property now, many floors are closed and if you are in the room during",1,1
"I spent 1 night at this Pullman property (luckily 1 night, was supposed 3 nights) besides the view and the location, the experience was terrible  1, There were two men at the lobby and I’m not so sure what are their role. I’m not excepting the service is same as the luxury hotels but they were surprised me they decided to stand and chat when they saw a girl was carrying 3 baggages under the rain and just got off from the taxi.   2, the check in is efficient   3, I saw a man was complaining the TV was not working...said that the technician came for a few times and that customer request for changing a new room. I didn’t pay much attention on it until I found the TV in my room was not working as well, also the WiFi was down. I quoted what that man shouted at the lobby “come up",1,1
Check-in was helpful and the manager all are they didn't have room service assisted with getting us pizza but that was pretty much the best thing that happened at the hotel. The breakfast was awful and the room service was also awful. When I complained I was belittled and made Cry. The service is offered will not clearly explained. There is not a direct view of the Eiffel Tower. The housekeepers didn't clean the room properly even went off to assist. There was not much support for families,1,1

Booked in 3 nights at this good locale next to Eiffel Tower. Check in reasonable but Accor membership didn't make any difference when one is from Aust - no perks! Renovations in progress and noisy all day including on Saturdays. Room old and in need of repair especially bathroom. Ambient noise from other rooms noticeable too. No tissues in room no tea replacement. Bar fridge locked. Tv channels no CNN or Sky. Got locked out in lift as key card not valdated properly at check in and treated like a crook when reporting it to a very ill mannered person asking for proof of id at check in counter. Breakfast ok and sufficient choice with ok service. Really though this hotel needs to get its act together for the rate it charges and is not up to Accor 4 or 5 star standards! Recommend use,2,1
"The hotel was a great disappointment to what one would expect from a Pullman abc that too in Paris. To start of the location is great if you wanna be close to the Eiffel Tour and yet away from traffic and noise!  Just like to add I’m a gold Accor member and never gonna stay here again. First on check in we spent over 20 min to clarify that we had paid for breakfast then when I even showed them the invoice and the Accor app, I generally pay a lot to take the balcony room and was given one on the 2nd floor with no view and could hear the construction downstairs!  The room size was ok but after paying a deposit of 500 euro for a 5 night stay the minibar was locked and needed to call to unlock! Room had one bottle of water for a room meant for 2 people and needed to call again and",2,1
"This was my third visit to the Pullman Hotel at the Eiffel Tower, and the experience was very disappointing.  My previous visits were satisfactory, but things have gone downhill at the hotel. First the place was really crammed with guests, including swarms of people on guided tours staying at the hotel..  I asked for a room upgrade as I'm an Accor Hotel Platinum member, but there was no chance as the hotel was fully occupied.  The degree of crowding in the lobby was uncomfortable.  To add to the crowds there was a large conference event in the hotel which produced more traffic.  Second the bar service was very poor, with the servers refusing to make eye contact when customers were seeking service.   The bar staff frequently looked at their watches and phones to check the time,",2,1
"Normally I'm a very positive person when it comes to reviews. But not this time.  When I arrived at the hotel the staff were so friendly and welcoming. And that was all the good I have to say about the hotel.  I paid extra for a balcony and asked for a room with a good view. I was put on floor 4 (wow, thanks so much guys [sarcasm]) and could only see the top of the Tour Eiffel because my low level balcony had its view blocked by neighbouring buildings.   When I arrived, the basin drain was pulled out, AND the shower drain was pulled out too, so I had to put them back in. The shower had mould build up and there were still water marks on the bathroom mirror. The balcony door was also left unshut and a cold draught blew into the room.   The room was incredibly cold for my stay. The",2,1
"We were booked in here for 2 nights as part of a Viking cruise/tour.  What a debacle!  This place is the absolute worst hotel I have stayed in - anywhere in the world.  This is now my standard for the worst hotel experience - not a target I would aim for! The porter left our bags waiting on the footpath, with no one watching while he casually wandered about looking for a trolley.  Check in was via a Viking representative - average. We asked at reception about getting a corkscrew for our room - you would think we had asked for their first born - they told us to basically go away and ring room service - very rude, even by French standards. Our shower didn’t do hot water on day one, and I had to get stroppy to get a timely resolution so we could be on time for our Viking city tour.",1,1
"We are experienced travelers. This hotel is maybe a one star. At check in we were told our upper floor room was not ready and they would move us the next morning. The next day we we're rudely told we would not be moved. Instead stuck on the 2nd floor looking at someone's vegetable garden. The first day we were able to change our TV to English on channels. That evening it would not work and TV would not stay on. When we asked we we're rudely told the language did not change and nothing was wrong with the TV. They are also getting ready to remodel and have closed upper levels and staff has left because of looming remodel. Great location but not worth the price, there has to be better.",1,1
"I booked this hotel based on the great view and location; however I am very disappointed with the customer service considering this is a 4 star hotel. I guess I understand why its not five stars. This hotel was pre-booked through an agency and was packaged in our Eurotrip. It took us 4 hours to get our room and they kept forgetting about us. They said they would be charging us a hold on our credit card just for security. When I got home, and saw my statement, they ended up charging me for my hotel stay. The hotel stay was already paid for and pre-booked and I called and told the receptionist. She said she would take care of it and send me an email in the next hour. She admitted they charged me instead of the agency. Two days later, no e-mail and no charge. I call the hotel back",1,1
"We chose this place as it was very close to the Eiffel Tower and was advertised as 4 stars. I would personally give it 2 stars. Check in was loooong and our room wasnt ready for over an hour after check in time. When we finally got to our room the windows were all wide open, ( it was a hot day) so the room was hot. Cleaning equipment was lft throughout the room/ I suspect the windows were open due to the previous guests smoking as we could smell smoke. The aircon took for ever to cool down, infact it didn;t ever really get to an acceptable level. NO view at all of the Eiffel Tower just another hotel.  Although a family room, there was only one bed. There was a fold ourt bed BUT they wanted more money for sheets to use it. Front desk simply werent interested in our issues. On the",2,1

Booked a king only to discover we had a queen, not happy! On the day for check out we had paid to stay until 4. 2 phone calls & 2 people knocking on our door to say check out was at 12. No communication in the place at all!!! The only positive was the view of the Eiffel tour although there was a big air conditiong duct blocking some of the view. For the money you pay its not worth it.",2,1

"The hotel is located very close to Eiffel Tower, and was booked by Viking Cruises, but the service and guest room made me uncomfortable. When we opened the guest room door, there was strong smoking smell in this room. I talked to the front desk man and requested room change. The man refused to do so, saying the hotel was fully booked, but promised to clean the room again. Nothing was improved. The amenities in the room are not good either.It's just like a motel.",2,1
"I've stayed in hundreds of hotels, not dozens. I know when I leave the placard on the door for no housekeeping and I know when I don't. There is always a chance of it falling off but in this case, we just left the room and forgot something in the room, so the likelihood of it falls off in less than 5 minutes is unlikely. The maid was in the room and didn't understand English, no problem since I am in France. She replaced the towels and stuff and left after I stood holding the door for 5 minutes. She knew I didn't want her in the room but even thats ok.   I saw a bell hop in the hall and asked if he spoke English, he did. He was able to translate to her that I simply wanted her name. She proceeded to argue with the bell hop about the ""blanc"" side being there which even I know",2,1
"The hotel has a unique type of chaos in it's reception/ concierge/ room service. First of all, you have to wait in a queue for the front desk, because they are responsible for everything (at the end the priority would be for the check-in gusts). Also, the elevators are not working properly, some times after several gusts chooses their floors the elevator will reset and cancel all the choices (leading to crowded + delayed elevators) Moreover, the working stuff were a combination of three different categories (varying from those who were extremely helpful, these who wanted to help but found a linguistic problems in communication, or the others whom had an extremely poor attitude) Finally, room service the the laundry was good, but the restaurant was something else, I had the worst",2,1
I had a question regarding making a reservation for an upcoming stay and they have yet to answer me back. This was sent over the weekend. We are still going to stay there because we will only be in Paris for a short time and it seems very close to the Eiffel Tower but it would be nice if they were not rude to future costumers.,1,1
"Terrible service. When I say terrible, one of the worst I've ever encountered. Watched employees trying customers drinks before sending them out. Waited 10 minutes to receive a menu and then the waiter laying down while we waited 10-15 min to pay. Side note we initially sat outside but was forced to move in when water soaked towels were being thrown down (landed a foot from me). No apology or compensation for the immense inconvenience. Would never recommend or spend money at this place.",1,1
"Very poor room with no view. Charged twice in the restaurant when my server told me my credit card did not go through. Found double charge on card when I returned home. Not a good experience and would certainly avoid this hotel on future visits to Paris. To my server in the restaurant, I hope your scam is found out by management. Other staff at the hotel were very pleasant and efficient.",1,1
"Went to stay here in July for 5 nights as final leg of my journey. Firstly I admit you needed to pay upfront and was advised no refund, I paid around $2,500 for 5 nights. Regrettably I became ill and rushed to hospital in Italy so could not complete final leg. My airfares and tours all got refunded, I did ask the Pullman given the unforeseen circumstances that in this tough and competitive market that there moral ethics may have come in to play. I did suggest take a deposit of goodwill and got response ""Sorry we are keeping all your funds"". Only took me two years to save for the trip and said if I come back before the end of 2017 I could have the room.(Gee how generous) not one word of empathy for their customer just to make a buck so be very wary when booking this hotel as if",1,1
"We stayed here for one night in June 2017.  We paid approximately $100 extra (bringing the 1 night to over $500USD) for a view of the Eiffel Tower and were very excited to see the balcony with the view.  Upon check in, we were assigned a room on the 2nd floor and were told the hotel was booked and a higher floor was not available. When we opened the door to the room, we were met with a VERY strong chemical odor - presumably from cleaning products. Then we walked out to the balcony and found there was sort of a view, but you kind of had to hang over the rail a bit and look way towards the right. Not even close to what we expected. Also, there wasn't one piece of furniture on the balcony, so even if we wanted to sit out there it wasn't possible anyway.  Very disappointing",2,1
"My wife and I just spent 3 nights at the Pullman in a balcony room with supposed views of the Trocadero and the Eiffel Tower. Unfortunately our room was on floor 7 and you have a limited filtered view of the Trocadero but if you go out onto your balcony you have an amazing view of the Eiffel Tower. Given the price you pay for these rooms the service by staff is poor with a ""couldn't care"" attitude. The location is just a short 2 minute walk to the Tower itself however I am sure you could find better rooms with similar view at a more competitive price. As an Accor Gold member I assumed we would have received some acknowledgement but got none. I won't stay at this hotel again.",2,1
"We first visited the Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel when a tour company used it as a meeting spot during our Summer 2016 Paris visit.  At that time I said ""if I ever come back to Paris I want to stay here.""  Based on its location so close to Bir Hakim Metro, the Eiffel Tower, and the Seine river boat tours.  So we went back in July 2017 and stayed at Pullman Paris.  Check in was super smooth.  This trip we took our kids 12 and 17.  I called the Pullman and they said they had no rooms that would accommodate all of us and said I had to book 2 rooms.  So I did.  At that time I requested that the rooms be on the same floor and either beside each other or across from each other.  They said they would do their best.  A month before we left, I emailed the hotel and relayed the request",2,1
"We had high expectations about this hotel and was supposed to be one of the high lights of our stay in Paris. We are Platinum card holder with Accor loyalty program so all the more we expected the VIP treatment that we always receive from other Pullman and accord hotels. Boy were we in for a BIG disappointment.  When we walked into the hotel to check in, NOBODY SAID ANYTHING TO US, not even a welcome. We stood at the Priority check in counter for good 10 minutes but no one came to assist. No one helped with luggage. Breakfast is average. If Eiffel tower view is not available, this hotel would have nothing to offer. I personally regretted we chose to stay here as the price was not cheap and could have chosen other better hotel.",2,1
"I reserved a room with a balcony and Eiffel Tower view.  Well, the balcony was a space about four feet wide and with no furniture. Not usable.  Unless one went out on the balcony and looked 90 degrees to there was NO view of the tower.   The hotel represents that they have 24 hour room service.  One evening I called to place an order and was told the kitchen was closed.    I had requested an early check in when I made my reservation.  They did not accommodate the request, and we sat in the lobby for 3 hours waiting for a room to be ready.",2,1
"I was entirely underwhelmed by my experience staying at this property. Though the location is fantastic, many negative factors came into play. My wife and I arrived early in Paris and left our bags with the valet. When we returned to pick up our room keys at 2 pm, we had to wait for 30 minutes as only two people were there not only checking in guests, but acting as concierge at the same time. When we finally did get our room keys, they said they would have someone bring up the bags. After sitting in the room for an hour and exhausted after traveling for 21 hours, we went downstairs where the guy who was suppose to deliver our bags said they never gave him the ticket. We carried our own bags up to the room where, once we pulled the sheets back on the bed, saw that the mattress",2,1
"This hotel is very standard.  I found the corridors dirty and were in need of an urgent paint job.  The rooms were clean. The lobby was stinking hot as they had no air conditioning.  The breakfast was terrible and way over priced. Looked like something from jail Close to the Eiffel Tower, probably the only thumbs up",1,1
Pullman Eiffel Paris just made our Paris visit so terrible with  false promises and a 4 hour wait at the hotel lobby for check in with a tired 6 year old kid for a confirmed pre paid booking.  Booked room was a trocadero suite with Eiffel tower view with special instructions to provide the same on the highest floor. However after making us wait for more than 3 hours in the lobby the room given was in the 3rd floor with an electric post view.,1,1

"I stayed at this hotel in early May and it was the worst experience I ever had as I am an avid traveler.  We also paid extra for a view of the Eiffel Tower.  On the first day, we got to the hotel early and they said that our rooms weren't ready.  We were prepared for that and they said that they would pre check us in and took our passports to make copies and promised us high floors for our rooms when we returned.  Later that evening when we returned to the hotel, the room we walked into had other guests staying there and when we returned to the front desk, they thought we were with them. They weren't a part of our reservation at all.  The other guests were Asian so they thought that was why we were together.  They almost lost the passport information for my friend that was",1,1
"My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights in the view room.  The room is nice beds are comfortable and bathroom/shower was great. Location was excellent - overpriced even for Europe.  Dislikes:  Only 2 coffee pods per day felt very cheap. Internet was appalling, very little access and did not work 80% of the time. When complain I got a blank stare saying the would let management j ow. They offered upgrade for  9 euros per 20mb. Are we in 1990?  The restaurant was very poor, service staff needed better education and couldn't handle a nearly empty restaurant, they even gave us the wrong meal when we ordered veal. Then tried to tell us the lamb was veal. When they agreed to make a new on they offered to keep the other meal warm... what?  When these issues were raised on check out",1,1
"I booked Deluxe room for my 2 nights stay in Paris. As a Le Club Accor Platinum, I normally got upgraded to superior room type in most of the Accor hotels without asking. The rule is - if there is availability, I get upgraded automatically at check-in.  At this hotel, they didn't follow this rule of Accor. They didn't bother to upgrade even their is vacancy. I got to ask the staff about the upgrade and he upgraded me to ""the last Junior suite"" with ugly view -- not an Eiffel tower view.  I got the room, 932. Unfortunately this room is located under their event floor on the rooftop. It was also next to the service lift shaft which operated the whole night. The noise of all the activities from the top floor was so loud from evening till 1100 pm. The noise of the lift has continued",1,1
I booked AND PAID IN FULL and got confirmation # for the 1186 square foot Eiffel tower suite at the Pullman Paris Tour Effiel hotel and after I paid they changed my room to a 775 smaller room and didn't tell me. I HAVE EMAILS WITH ALL THE PROOF REQUIRED and the hotel has refused to honor the reservation. This is my honeymoon trip. I have been taken advantage of. We were engaged in Pairs a year ago and wanted to go back for our honeymoon. Pullman Hotel has ruined this trip back to Paris for us. I have informed the better Business Bureau and my lawyer. BEWARE OF BOOKING WITH THIS COMPANY!,1,1
"Just checked in this morning. Since my flight arrived very early in the morning (before 6am), by the time I arrived the hotel, no room was available. This is understandable. The staff took down my cell phone number, telling me that they would text me when the room is ready. I waited at the lobby working at my laptop. The lobby soon became very noisy because there were a lot of groups... At 11am, I couldn't stand the environment any longer. I approached the front desk to ask if a room of my category had become available. And IT WAS available...but no one had ever contacted me. I guess the staff are not very empaphetic. And very funny, when I approached the front desk with a tired look checking for the availability of room, instead of something caring, I was asked if I was aware",2,1
I've just checked in to this hotel. I pre-booked and pre-paid for a deluxe room as I wanted a view of the Eiffel Tower. Very disappointed to find myself on the 2nd floor with no view of the Eiffel Tower unless I crane my head around the divider on the balcony. Front desk unable to help. I checked in at 12 noon and understood that the room would not be readily available but did not expect to receive such a bad room when we returned at 5 pm.,2,1
"I booked a room that said I would have a room with a view of the Trocadero and the Eiffel Tower. This is what I expected, but instead the view was of a soccer field and I had to look around the corner of the balcony to see the Eiffel Tower. I complained about the view and asked for another room with the view that I paid almost $600 per night to see. I was told that was the only view from any room. Also, there was a balcony but no chairs or small table! What point is having a balcony if you can't sit and relax on it. We had to drag the one small chair in the room and a luggage rack out to the balcony so we could sit. Ridiculous. The one positive point is the location.",2,1
"I was really looking forward to the stay at Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel. The reviews seemed good and the location right by the Eiffel Tower seemed perfect for a few days in Paris over the Valentines period.   It was smooth enough to begin with by checking in and a nice enough room, although our booking said Garden view - now we knew you pay a lot more for the Eiffel Tower view but the ""garden view"" is basically the building of the hotel behind it. Maybe it was our room or side of the building we were facing but there was no garden here...  Not a massive issue as who comes on a trip to stare outside their hotel window, right? So moving on, we bring some food up to the room and ask reception for some cutlery - that would incur a €5 room charge as it is room service (but they would",2,1
"Me and my wife booked a stay for a week for our anniversary and picked the wrong month by mistake.  We were booking over a month in advance, so we called Accor and Emailed the Pollman hotel.  We were told that they will not credit us towards the correct date.  They said we would have to pay again and said we should file a claim with our travel insurance?   We caught it the same day within hours, and called right away.  They are inflexible and do not care about their customers.  We are out lots of $$ and getting nothing for it.  Beware!",1,1

"I stayed at the Pullman for four (4) nights from April 23 to 27 for a business trip and meeting at the hotel (room 842). The location is convenient and is very close to the Eiffel tower and public transportation. The staff were pleasant during check-in/out and in the restaurant which serves breakfast. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this hotel due to the current condition of the bathrooms. First, the bathtub in my room was poorly designed and has an outer edge that is very sharp (normally the edge should be rounded or totally flush against bathtub wall). As a result, my ankle was cut very badly while stepping out of the bathtub and I'm still having trouble walking several days later. I should mention that I did bring this incident to the attention of the hotel staff and they",2,1
"My second day at the Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel and my wallet is missing from the room. So far everything was OK, the room and the service are good and my review was going to be very good until the second day/today. In the morning I decide to leave my wallet in the room because of the bunch of thefts in Paris. So I put it in my closed luggage. There was no money in it (only some personal cards) and that's why I didn't put it in the safe. In the evening when we get back I noticed it's missing and complained to the reception. The wallet was very rare and limited edition Philipp Plein brand and it was a present from my wife so it's not only very expensive but it's sentimental for me. I'll write more when I've got news from the staff and I hope they'll fix the problem!",1,1
"We made a typographical error when selecting the dates for our travel and they will not credit us for even a portion of the amount that we prepaid for use for the correct dates, we are now out almost $300.00 , very disappointing, I was not asking for a full refund, even a partial would do and they won't budge, whatever you do, DO NOT prepay for your room, stay somewhere else, there are plenty of other hotels to choose from in Paris",1,1
Good view of Eiffel Tower.   No AC despite 60 degree weather outside forcing us to sleep with windows open. Average service at best. Dirty floors in hallways. You're ONLY paying for the view. Would not repeat.,2,1
"First the good. The location can't be beat with the iconic Eiffel Tower at its doorstep. Rooms with a view have to be booked accordingly. Convenient access to transportation. Cabs constantly available outside the Hotel. 6-minute walk to metro. 4-minute walk to RER.   The in-house restaurant is Frame. It's an all in one outlet that serves as the restaurant, bar and vinoteca. The price of Frame is fair for where you are and the service is quite good. Breakfast may be included (which ours was) and the spread is really quite generous and varied.   The bad. The hotel service is abysmal from the get go. There is a registration desk smack in the middle of the lobby and the line to it is disorganized. ""Front desk"" service is slow and inefficient. Halfway through my stay my key card was",2,1
"The hotel is modern and OK. Very overprized becouse IT is very close to the eiffeltower.  Quick check in, late check out, since they doubled the bill on minibar (digital registered)  Large gym in the hotel, but it is only central to the eiffeltower, you have to walk 2-4 km to Champs de elysse, latin quarter and other more interesting area.   The area around the hotel is not an exciting one. We have stayed in Two other hotels in Paris that was better, more central and cheaper (Melia and IHG). They were fully booked This time so We gave pullman a second try and regret. . We last gave Pullmann 3 stars, we now give them Two.  The hotel and the Breakfast should with normal prises and a Good staff, have 5 star.  We Asked them to fill the minibar twice, but NO We asked them to change a",2,1
"I called concierge service to ask to bring wine glasses, and it took nearly 1 hour. During that 1 hour, I called several times but she didn't say any sorry to me. ""If you don't want to wait, come to the lounge bar and bring wine glassed by yourself."" That was her answer, and I asked again. ""Is it Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel's service?""  She answered without any hesitation and sorry, ""Yes!"" I don't understand whether she got any proper training to welcome customers. What's more, it was the last night of my honeymoon!!!",1,1
"The only thing near by is the tower. Have to ride the Merro at least 2 stops to find interesting restaurants, neighborhoods. Also, it's getting a little shabby room wise. On the plus side people at the desk were very helpful.",2,1
"Worst ever experience in my entire life. I would not rate more than 2 star experience  and pathetic service . Staff especially Ms laune (front office manager ) is extremely rude. The hotel room does not have single mirror in the room, bed bug in room, smell in room and above all saw a customer shouting in lobby and really furious on 6th Jan, 2017. Will never suggest anyone to take this hotel . Only thing to the advantage of hotel is location but whole service experience is simply disgusting. Total waste of money :(",1,1
"We stayed here for 3 nights. The check-in process was a nightmare. There was a long line of people waiting to check-in. The man who checked us in was quite rude and kept doing other things in the middle of checking us in. Finally he told me we were 20 minutes early for check-in and I could wait or take another room 2 floors down from where we were supposed to be. Also, I told him my husband was having problems in the parking garage and finding the elevator. He said something rude about it not being that hard and walked away. Shortly after arriving we reported several problems in our room which we were assured would be fixed immediately. They never were. Yet, we payed for these things that did not work. Outside the hotel there are female pickpockets who try to get you distracted",1,1
"Just unclean rooms, we noted that they don't clean and wash the glasses and very bad WIFI. I am not advising any to check in!!  No tissues! Water leaking! Non clean bathroom, actually disgusting!  I complained for the WIFI and they have just sent the manager to me and an apologizes without any solution!  I wonder that i am in Paris and in a hotel which is close to tour Eiffel!!   It doesn't worth more than 2 stars actually!",1,1
"I just returned home yesterday after being taken on a surprise trip by my partner so he could propose. Having looked back from when we first checked in, there was no particular way in which they made this experience any more special for us. My partner got everything spot on but the hotel let us down. I found out it cost €311 for one night stay with a partial view of the eifell tower which I have to say was very stunning and I feel lucky to have woken up to such a lovely view. I would have thought that the hotel would have arranged something a little special maybe a bottle of wine, flowers or breakfast in bed but we had a less than 'special' experience. The room was clean and cosy, not extravagant in any way. The bed had a topper on the mattress and was very soft so we ended up",2,1
"Overall the experience at the Pullman was lacking. The killer for me was the I'm room amenities. Horrible Wi-Fi, a very poorly done entertainment system, low water pressure (on both of the shower heads) and low hot water temperature. Add that up and the $270/night to get a partial view of the base of the Eiffel tower isn't worth the money.   Also note, we were supposed to be booked on a higher floor, but were told our room wasn't ready, so we got dropped to the 4th floor. Lots of noise where we're at (I get it, we're in a city), but not so much fun when you get woken by leaf blowers at 6 AM. was hoping the higher floor would limit that.   Anyhow, only been here less than 24 hours, hoping the experience improves, but at present I would stay away from this hotel.  Wishing I had",2,1
"My husband and I stopped at the Pullman Hotel to check out the restaurant menu and the lodgings and sat down at the bar to have a drink. Two men sat down next to me and put their coats over my bag and just walked out with all my treasured jewelry, passports, phone, glasses, licenses, my mom and dad's wedding rings and the hotel was lackadaisical and most unhelpful. There is no security. They had a video of what happened but would not let us see it. We were appalled by their lack of sympathy and they implied that this happens all the time in Paris. Where is their security??? If this is so prevalent, why not have a security guard?  Negligence and distress here...we would never recommend.",1,1
Was on the 10th floor and the room was extremely hot and the Air Conditioning is off for the season.  Arrived there mid morning after a long flight. Outside air temperature was about 12C was able to open the window however unable to cool room down  for comfortable sleeping.  The solution is very simple.  All the Hotel needs to do is install fans on the outside wall that would force ambient air into the room.  This would give hotel guests the ability to cool the rooms down at a minimal ongoing cost to them. Another issue was the internet was very intermittent.  It would work for a few minutes and then drop off.  One final issue was a random wake up call that I did not ask for.  Hotel might be OK during the Summer with the A/C on or when the outside temperature is below 5C. But,1,1
"I booked this hotel due to the level of high ratings. I booked and paid for a room with Eiffel tower view (as pictured on the hotel's Orbtiz page) and included a note requesting a high floor. Not only did the room have NO view of the Eiffel tower, but we were placed on the 1st floor, right above the entrance...where the noise of cars and taxis is easily heard. When I spoke to management, I was told they couldn't accommodate the room I requested and paid for on that night, but the ""manager"" whose name was Youssef promised to move us to an acceptable room the next night...that did NOT happen. The staff is rude, dismissive and doesn't give a care in the world. If i request a high floor and you can't accommodate it, the least the hotel could have done would have been to give a room",1,1
"I am an ex hotelier and just arrived from this hotel back home.  Hotel has a good location , tho i guess it is a bit old . We had 126 room with garden view and it was big and with a nice balcony and garden view. Walking distance from the tower and in general is a nice hotel.   But there are no service ..     1. Before check in i have send a few emails to concierge to do pre bookings - ( they have sent offer to pick up so i responded to same email )  emails was not answered within several days   So i called : the lady who was answered the phone tolled me that she cannot take my details and follow up with concierge as her department is not in charge and that is not her work .

"We are still here and have another two nights. We were here last year and really enjoyed the experience and as such have recommended the hotel to many friends and family. However, sadly this time, after prepaying our accommodation almost 12 months in advance, we are treated with what can only be described as second rate. We have travelled to Dublin, London and Rome on this trip and the Pullman has rated last on all levels. I won't be returning or recommending the hotel in the future to friends or family. Terrible experience......!!!",1,1
We sat on the cafe for 1/2hr before being served but as it was an ok place it was sort of ok. Them we ordered 2 pots of tea (English ) and they came back and avised they had no English tea. What sort of 4 star hotel does not have this type of tea? Not very good.,1,1
Nice enough but so much wrong. Lovely balcony overlooking the Eiffel Tower. But no seats on balcony at all. Complete lack of good wifi signal which is unforgivable in this day and age. Front of house staff very nice but staff and service in the hotel's Frame bar and restaurant appalling. Don't ask for a coffee after 11pm - they turn the coffee machine off! Much nicer hotels in Paris. This one rests on its laurels thanks to location next to the tower which is wonderful. But it's not enough.,2,1
"My flight was canceled due to an air traffic controller strike in France.  After trying to call the hotel (more than 6 times) to no answer, I finally got someone in the evening shift.  I explained my problem, and they said that I paid for the hotel and there was nothing they could do.  Ironically beyond the strike, the French Government declared a ""state of emergency"" due to severe flooding, which worsened the situation.  The front desk acknowledged my problems, but said they wouldn't reimburse me even though traveling to Paris the next day or day after would be pointless with the flooding.  Effectively, the front desk staff was useless, and the manager I spoke with was as rude as could be...curt and quick to hang up on me.  I'm sure it's a beautiful hotel (why I booked in the",1,1
"Although this hotel is in a great location and has great views of the Eiffel Tower, the overall service is less than acceptable given the fact that they rate themselves as an ""upscale"" hotel.  Our room requests were rarely honored.  One time I had to phone 3 times to get some pillows and ice delivered to my room.  On another occasion, my request was never honored.  The service in the Frame restaurant was very poor.  We had dinner there with 2 local attorneys and the service was so bad, they even refused to tip.  However, the service from the breakfast staff was excellent.  There is no real concierge service either and the majority of the front desk staff was really not very helpful or even knowledgeable.  For example, they knew little about the local transportation and rather",1,1
"My family and I stayed here from August 2nd until August 9th. The staff was very unfriendly and not accomadating at all. 2 days room was not cleaned and mini bar not refilled. Called front desk at 5pm and asked for both things to be done was told I would have to wait until the following day. And, to make matters worse, when we checked out, they ran our credit card twice. I called and they were no help at all to fix the situation. Claim had to be filed with our credit card company. The food is awful too. Room service, breakfast and the restaurant. They also charge you a fee to store your own items in the mini bar. We were overcharged for that as well. If you want an enjoyable stay in Paris, do not stay here.",1,1
"I arrived at this hotel having been mugged on the tube and having my handbag stolen. The staff could not have been any more unhelpful or unsympathetic. I could not pay with the original credit card as it was stolen, and I needed to speak to my bank as to how I could pay. The reception staff treated me like a petty criminal and told me I could not stay without full payment, they did not even want me to sit in reception to sort it. I made a formal complaint the next day and received no response to this. On return to the UK I have asked for a letter confirming what happened on arrival at there hotel and now customer services have even refused to provide this for my travel insurance claim. I am a Pulman member and will never use them again. If you expect even a little customer",1,1
"After a long day of travel, we arrived to the hotel to have the check in attendant tell us that our reservation (prepaid mind you) had been cancelled and they had no reservation for us. Thankfully I came prepared with our confirmation number, receipt etc so I pulled that out and he did some digging and found out it had been cancelled ( still unclear why ) and rebooked but they put my last name as my first name. WHOOPS?? After 8 hours on a plane and an hour and 15 minute ride to the hotel from CDG this was really not the right way to start our visit here. THen he proceeded to argue that I didnt book an eiffel tower view room ( although my printout confirmed it ) and that I booked a queen bed instead of a king. Again, thankfully I had the confirmation information with me since",2,1
My wife and I stayed here on our trip to Paris.  The room was beautiful but the air conditioning only work sporadically and when we asked for a fan we were told it was not possible.  Third day we finally got a fan and it certainly helped the poor ac performance.    The television here is wireless based and clearly they don't have enough bandwidth to cover the demand.   Also using our laptops at night was next to impossible connected to their wifi.   Not to say our stay was completely negative.  We did have a balcony room with a beautiful view of the Eiffel tower.  The only thing that would have made that better was some small chairs on the balcony.,2,1
"We stayed at the Pullman after our Viking river cruise. The best thing that I can say is that the location near the Eiffel Tower was perfect. The hallways are dark and can be compared to a prison. Our room smelled terrible as soon as we walked in. I think the smell could be traced to mold in the bathroom. Bed was comfortable. In room safe was appreciated as were the robes and slippers. It was not noisy especially when you consider the Eurocup soccer was in progress. Fitness room on our floor was convenient and was stocked with cold waters. Breakfast room had many choices, but my yogurt had green mold growing on it, and fellow travelers said the scrambled eggs were inedible. Safe to go with the omelette cooked to order and the croissant. Carpet in the breakfast room was",2,1
"I'm in the travel industry but here on holiday. Selected this hotel due to the Pullman hotels I have previously reviewed for work have been exceptional. Not so in this case. Had our first night here of 5 last night and while the rooms are clean and reasonable size, the beds are less than satisfactory and the staff have little options to resolve. Could have stayed next door at the Mecure (where my daughter is staying) for 1/3 of the price. The only extra I get for my added expense is free movies, I'll pass thanks. Sorry Pullman, but this is a fail.",2,1
"Came here with a Viking cruise ship for the second part of the trip. To put my review in context I am a sucker for a luxury hotel. I don't cheap out. I'm willing to pay and I don't whine about price. I'm always working remotely so wifi and a nice desk matter.  Don't be deceived by this place. It's a cheap tourist hotel.  Weird issue with check-in - someone else with my name checked into my room. Luggage in hand the receptionist refused to believe I really was myself. With a passport. She saw two people with my name and still argued with me. Another patron said ""you know an apology would be nice"" to her. Nothing. She finally figured everything out.  Now for the review:  Pros: Wifi reasonably fast but you'll have to pay for fast version Workspace is decent  Easy taxis outside",2,1
The PullmanEiffel Tower was very disappointing.  We checked in after a wonderful Viking Cruise and were expecting to check into a 4 star hotel directly in front of the Eiffel Tower.  The room was smelly and the air conditioning was not working properly.  We reported both problems to the front desk but no one was ever sent up to address our issues nor was a different room offered.  The staff always seemed overwhelmed and disinterested.  The hotel is in need of renovations and looked run down.  The stay was not cheap.  We felt cheated.  We will never go back or recommend this hotel.,1,1
"TV, outlets under TV, phone, mini-bar and hot water maker had no electricity to them.  Air Conditioning did not work. Only fan at low speed. Very stiff bed. Went to Lobby to report problem at 5:10 pm and waited over an hour and a half with no technician arriving at room. Left to dine with colleagues. Arrived a couple of hours later nothing accomplished. Key inserted by entrance. All other lights worked fine.",1,1
"We stayed here as part of a tour package and I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone - let me count the ways:  1.  The hotel was unreasonably hot and stuffy.  It was so unhealthy we both became ill.  In fact, several of us became ill on the same floor.  I understand that the air is off for winter, however, the fans should work and circulate fresh air (not cooled).  We were told to shut off the fans altogether.  We did and it only got worse.  We had to have our balcony door open to get done relief (over 80). Try sleeping in a Friday night with Paris traffic noise and concert noise - not pleasant.  2.  We provided a credit card but couldn't access the mini bar for a cool drink because of their computer issues.  After a lengthy phone call and running back and forth while they",1,1
"It was my first day in my honeymoon and i booked and paid for an early check-in to get my room early. I arrived and asked the staff about my room , he said it is not ready and i had to wait. i have waited for 20 minutes and still the room was not ready, I went for a walk without taking rest after my 7 hours flight and came back to the hotel after 1 hours and still the room was not ready. They promised me that the room will be ready in 5 minutes and had to wait 45 minutes and finally get my room. To make it up to me , they offered me a late check out up to 15:00 and when i went to check their website their normal check out was at 15:00. I would like to congratulate this hotel and give them a great applause and certificate in ""Cheating their Customers""",2,1

"The good:   1) if you get a balcony suite, the view of the tower from our room (512) was great.  2) Antoine at the front 'desk' was a nice-seeming fellow.  The bad:   1) We traveled mid-trip, so 4 total times coming and going with bags, and not once did a door man offer to help us with our bags. Once we got into the lobby, 3 clerks looked at us while I tried to maneuver 4 bags around, and never offered to help.    2) Spider webs in the room. We asked for them to clean 3 times, and they never did. See pics.   3) Walls were peeling.   4) Showers were lukewarm, with the temperature set at full hot.   5) The breakfast at 26 euros was average.

"Overall this was disappointing. The Eiffel  Tower is actually at a right angle to the hotel so if you want to see it you have to lean out of the balcony. Otherwise you are looking at a football pitch and even the delight of flood lights from said pitch when it gets dark. Most promotion material will have you believe the Eiffel  Tower is right in front of you.  Rooms are basic with few English tv channels, breeze block walls and no turndown service.   The room was frequently too hot and the thermostat clumsy. Breakfast room exceedingly hot.   You are far out of town in this location and I felt duped. Better to stay in town with a view of the Tower in the distance.",2,1
"I booked this hotel through Booking.com for my wife's birthday. 2 Adults, 2 nights with Breakfast.  When we arrived we confirmed this and were told what time breakfast was, at no point were we told different.   Upon checkout we were given a bill for 2 days breakfast as I was told that wasn't included even though the booking was for 2 the breakfast was only for 1??? The booking I showed them I had paid for 2 Adults with breakfast. They simply didn't want to know and insisted I pay up.  People may think I am being petty but through booking.com I could have booked the same room without breakfast for cheaper but I choose to include breakfast. The reception handled the situation terribly in my opinion and told me to take it up with booking.com not them.  Out of principle I wouldn't",1,1
"This hotel has an excellent location, and great rooms.   However, the service is very poor, especially in the hotel restaurant where the staff couldn't even take a simple food order correctly for just 3 persons, which ruined a very expensive meal.

You pay for the location at this hotel - not the service, which is very poor.",2,1

We stayed in a room that was not updated. Black mold around the tub and the repairs that were done were very poorly. Toilet seat was the wrong shape for the toilet so you would sit with one cheek inside the bowl. Room needed to be repainted. The number was missing of door. Tried to move rooms but staff was not helpful nor accommodating.,1,1

After searching the whole room, we called the front desk and they sent the housekeeping manager up who said she spoke to the person cleaning our room and stated 'she didn't take it'. We then went down to the front desk to complain and the manager said they cannot get hold of housekeeping because it's out of hours. So we were lied to by the first person. All in",1,1

We arrived back at 3:00 and the room was still being cleaned. They did not refresh the supplies and I had to go ask the maid down the hall for them.  I will say that the restaurant service was great and the food was very good.  We have three more nights here and I am dreading it.",2,1
"Other than a good location, there is nothing good about this hotel. The tiny room has all of the charm of a college dorm room. The bedroom and the breakfast room feature 1950s retro furniture that is very uncomfortable to sit in. And the bedrooms are too warm but they turn off the air-conditioning in fall, giving you the option to make your hotter still or leave it as is. The very uncomfortable breakfast room is too hot (except for the coffee which is barely warm). They have a modest size buffet of mediocre food. No brown breads of any kind, scrambled eggs that have no taste and aren't warm, etc. Overall, I'd give this hotel a big Ugh!",1,1

"When you first enter and see how luxurious the hotel appears to be, you'd think you're going to get 5-star service -- especially at the prices they're charging. But you would be wrong.   The front-desk service was ok, but the in-room service was terrible. Cleaning staff left their own trash in my room several days in a row -- a half-drunk can of coke one day in the bathroom, a half-eaten packet of cookies the next on the desk, replete with scattered crumbs. So finally I hung a ""do not disturb"" sign on the door the next day, thinking it would be best if they just didn't clean my room at all. Did they heed the sign? Nope.   My colleagues also dealt with worse inconveniences, including being charged for breakfasts they did not eat, a flooded bathroom (water coming from ceiling),",2,1
"Pretty bleak stay, really. Check in – a disaster. A really odd set-up with tables in the middle of the foyer among a sea of people. Arriving guests didn't have a clue what was going on – signage was non-existent (as per other reviews, people weren't sure where to go - the island desks? the reception desks?) and staff were milling around like headless chickens among the crowd, exuding an air of complete chaos. Combine this with a bunch of guests arriving for a conference, and the first impression was bordering on the shambolic.

It takes ages and still no one is gone say even hello 😭 the room completely overpriced (219) - you have to go on the balcony to the very left to see a bit of the Eiffel Tower - 260 pounds for one night 😂😂😂😂😂 booked via hotels.com!! Definitely guys don't do - you be will be very disappointed! Next time definitely a different hotel in Paris, because the city as such is beautiful 😍",1,1
"We stayed at the Pullman for 2 nights in early August 2015. It was the worst hotel experience I had in many years. Our luggage was left in front go hotel with little supervision. We waited over the 30 minutes for the elevators at 6pm. Hotel corridor was filled with large laundry bags to maneuver around as well as trash. The room smelled of electrical fumes. The lobby computers & printers were inoperable. The hotel seemed overwhelmed / rude with too many guest all complaining of rooms not being ready, etc. The breakfast in the morning were mediocre at best and servers were removing plates before we were finished. We will NEVER recommend or stay at the hotel again.",1,1
"I thought after paying 395 euro for a suit i would have a the best of the best, No i didn't, the decor is 1980's style finish, the shower was broken and we had no hot water for four hours, and our coffee machine that we had in a our room was broken, so what was good about the room ? the view of the eiffel tower was nice , the bed was comfortable dont book this place, i wouldn't recommend it, the place has three concierges working on the desks and there is a lot of people waiting to be checked in, for the price i paid i didn't even get breakfast, so ridiculous",2,1
"We arrived at 2 in the afternoon at the hotel after a long wait we got to check in counter there the receptionist tells me u check in time is 2 and I was yes it is 2.30 pl wait for 50 m. That's a joke we have stayed in one of the best hotels around the world and have not ever had a problem I really don't know why we have to make the guess wait after my travel agent has confirmed with them the same morning and they said the room is ready and we are ready to welcome the guest. This is a joke feeling v upset that we selected Pullman Eiffel and not our regular Shangri la , Hyatt made a big mistake thought of trying a new hotel BUT MADE A BIG MISTAKE.  NEVER AGAIN.

"The only thing this hotel  has going for it is the view of the Eiffel Tower from the rooms.   Staff: Indifferent and blamed each other when things went wrong. Uninformed/unable to assist with local restaurants, ""Just turn left you'll find a few"" .. really?   Cleanliness: Hallway was not vacuumed the entire 3 days we were there, there were empty candy wrappers on the floor. We'd come back from a busy day to find several large bags of DIRTY laundry in the hall way. yuch.  Food service: A fellow traveler asked for coffee at breakfast, it was  9:00 a.m. The wait staff in the restaurant clearly did not want to be bothered and told her they had no more coffee since breakfast service was almost over.

Once we arrived we were told the rooms with the view had been sold out and we were given a standard room with no view. we did not want to kick up a fuss and accepted the room were only here for two nights so we wanted to make the most of paris by sleeping early and waking up early on our first night we attempted to sleep at 9pm but the room above us had kids which were screaming and jumping on our ceiling we complained to front desk they said they would send security up however this nuisance went on till 2am we then complained in the morning to front desk they said they would look into it.

Closet in the room was very, very narrow. We had to ask for shampoo/conditioner when ours was almost out. The chair by the desk was not a good sturdy chair The que up system to the ""front desk"" was very confusing as was the que up to the concierge. When we finally got to the concierge, both of the folks knew very little and we were asking about a restaurant that was close by. The WiFi was up and down and very unreliable.",2,1

Some of the staff and brilliant some are far from. We were married in the Pullman Quay Grand in Sydney and this hotel doesn't come close to matching the quality.",2,1
"We stayed at the Pullman as part of a recent Tauck tour of Paris; otherwise I would never have booked there.  After checking the hotel photos on TA, a warning bell rang in my head: 90% of them showed the famous tower; with hardly any depicting the interiors of the hotel.  When we arrived, I found out why.  There is nothing even remotely photo-worthy at this hostelry.  It is as modern as a space capsule, and just as charming.  The ""front desk"" is a table on one side of the stark lobby, with three dark-suited staff STANDING on different sides typing on laptop computers, while the knots of confused travelers clutter all available floor space waiting to catch someone's eye.  Like flagging a taxi in Manhattan on a rainy day, the fastest person gets the next available receptionist.",1,1
"The hotel is in a good location, however the service is the worse than any hotel I have ever stayed. Staffs are very unhelpful, they won't try to help you at all.  Celebrated my husband's birthday here but both of us were very disappointed. I'm writing this review now still in this Pullman hotel room and can't wait to check out... very pricey, especially for the poor customer service. You only pay for the location. Plus we are staying in a room with Eiffel Tower view, but you have to go out to baloney and to see part of the Eiffel Tower, otherwise you can't see anything from the room... don't trust the hotel pictures.",2,1
"We visited Paris for our 25th wedding anniversary, so this was special to us. Upon arrival to check in we were 2nd in the queue. A receptionist came into the foyer to assist with the check in, however completely ignored us and served everyone else instead, on the 2nd day our bathroom lighting was broke so I went to the check in desk to get it rectified, and once again they completely ignored us. We stood for 45 minuted waiting for someone to assist us. Eventually we were attended to, I told the receptionist what had happened over the last 2 days of being ignored but she wasn't interested!!!! I didn't stay in the hotel much after that! it completely ruined my visit!",2,1

Unfortunately, the room was booked on a non-refundable rate and we had no insurance to cover the cancellation.  After I explained that the mother of my friend had a stroke and a heart attack, I was lead to believe that the hotel management would do something to cancel the reservation and provide a refund. Unfortunately, the head of the reception desk wanted to make it her personal mission to offer nothing.  Even though they would certainly have been able to book the room at a higher rate with other guests, she refused to do anything. My mother happened to be visiting Paris at the same time.  We",1,1
We booked 5 nights for a deluxe balcony room with the view of the eiffel tower. However the view was sad. From the room we can't see the tower. The only view is from balcony and it's right at the far corner of the balcony. Nothing like what is been advertised. In fact our room view is a football court. Total waste of money. I'll say if you book a room with view there only 25% chance you will get a room with a decent view. We drew a short end of the stick.  The check in and out area is terribly small and understaffed too. So there were always huge number of people waiting around disorganised for their turn during the peak hours.  Lift was crazy slow. So many guest we bumped into were grumbling   As I desperately wanted a room with a decent view at least for 1 night as it's a,1,1
"I choose this hotel because of the view and opted for a balcony room.  I was disappointed because although the view is nice the rest of the hotel lets down the experience.  The hotel is massive and the infrastructure can't cope.  We had to queue to check in at 4pm (via a weird check in table rather than a desk - room wasn't ready .... There are only 2 lifts so you have to queue with about 50 other people and wait for about 3 circuits of the lift before you get a chance to use it.  Breakfast was the worst ..... There must have been 700 people in the dining room, food all over the floor, 20 people waiting in line for the cooked choice .... Felt like a motorway service station restaurant, we went elsewhere even though it was included in our price  Staff friendly, bar looked nice ,",2,1
"Be extremely cautious when riding the elevators. If they get over the weight limit, the door closes and traps you in.  I spent an extremely uncomfortable 25 minutes in one with my family and several strangers last week. No ventilation whatsoever. By the time we were freed, the condensation on the metal and mirrored walls was running onto the floor.  The lift next to ours was stuck, too.  We could hear those people screaming and beating on the walls.  An absolute nightmare, and we aren't even claustrophobic. I spoke with someone at the front desk about it later that day, she said that it was due to the weight limit. She actually said 8 Parisians or 6 Americans is the max. The elevators are on the small side, and there aren't nearly enough for busy times of the day.",1,1

However most of my first day is ""currently"" a mess !!! .  In comparison to the other pullman hotels this branch is embrassing I believe.   First of all the front desk is made up of two computers and two men to deal with the long line of people waiting for their turn. They are very disorganised and people stood in front of the line when it's not their turn and they carelessly allowed them to do it. While others who stood for so long complained .. yup you guess it! They did not care!!!.  Alright moving on to the most important part ... The lobby is full of people laying around the sofas and waiting some even",1,1
"My disappointing experience concerns my reservation with the Pullman Hotel, Eiffel Tower in Paris.  I booked a deluxe room in March 2015 for my husband and myself with a balcony view of the Eiffel Tower  for July 14 and 15.  We wanted to celebrate ""Bastille Day"" by watching the fireworks show from our private balcony.  I confirmed our reservation 3 weeks before the date we were to travel to Paris and had everything in writing.  I received an email 5 days before we were to travel stating that ""due to circumstances beyond our control"", our room was downgraded to a garden view for July 14th but we could watch the fireworks from the 10th floor with the other guests.  I called the hotel and was told there were ""technical difficulties,"" but that the room would be available on the 15th",2,1
This hotel does not care about your experience at all.  There is no sense of service. The front desk is awful and rude.  The concierge is unhelpful.  They don't answer any questions.  This is the worst I've ever experienced. Clearly the manager of the hotel doesn't care either.,1,1

(I hope the company changes Paris hotels!). The only redeeming quality is its location near the Eiffel Tower, if you are new to Paris and want to explore this side of town 1.  The check-in space is bizarre and unfriendly; 2.  The staff were rude and appear to be displeased or unhappy -- the only bad ""staff"" experience in Paris. They were not accommodating -- need some customer service training at all staff levels. 3.  The room was clean, but mediocre -- we did not get the view room and we had twin beds.  We were told the queen bed was not available. Seriously? 4.  The breakfast was awful, on",1,1

In fact, we travel quite a bit and have stayed at over 25 Accor properties across the globe. Being a platinum Accorhotels member, I prefer to stay with them. They have tailormade options for all price ranges and stay types and it becomes easy to choose. I booked the Pullman for my wife's first ever trip to Paris and mine being the second.   Right from the go, the hotel was useless. We had booked a deluxe room with balcony and upon check in, we were told that the room was not available because it had a ""technical problem"".

My reasons for not ever staying at Pullman ever again are as follows: bad service; mediocre rooms and terrible value for money. As a sign of protest, I will launch a twitter account and a facebook page against Pullman, which will unite us all who were cheated by Pullman. I will explain my opinion as follows:  1. Do not expect to have a Eiffel Tower view. Firstly, for a room at Euros 350 you will not be given one. So, don't book this hotel expecting such a view. The attitude of the staff of this hotel is extremely disgusting and insulting. And you know what they don't care.   2. We paid around Euros 350.00/night for our stay at this hotel.

this hotel is completely overpriced and not suitable for young families or middle aged - senior couples. it seems to be aimed completely at YUPPIES. Their online and service desk booking system is flawed to the point of incompetence. totally ruined my 40th anniversary accomodation. Promised / implied direct views of the Eiffel Tower but any room facing remotely in that direction required you to virtually hang over the edge of the balcony to get a clear sight of it. Also uses electronic bar fridge data recording technology without first advising the guest of its existence. The system records and charges your account even if you remove and replace ANYTHING in the  bar fridge. the best thing I can say about this hotel is that it is with 5 minutes slow walk of the tower.

The receptionist checked the previous payments and said he can't give us the same price just because..The breakfast (Bufet) cost 26 euros in the morning.. Really?

Choose this place for my girlfriends birthday in December. Stayed for 5 nights. The hotel is extremely over priced and have stayed in better places for half the price. The view from the room was supposed to be a garden view but was actually of a loading bay with camouflage netting over it. The room itself was adequate. The room service was average.

I decided to give this hotel an other chance after having read that it was entirely refurbished. I used to be a regular client when it was still a Hilton. Yes it was rundown and in desperate need of refurbishment,  however using Frankenstein-Zen as an architect is a tempting fate. The result is a nightmare.  The reception is a farce. But now to the point.  My superior room, althouh smal, stank of Dettol, provoking instant nausea.  Paying a hefty supplement put me in to a tiny version of a junior suite that stark of Dettol all but not as much as the first room.

Then we had a fire alarm go off twice in the early morning waking the entire hotel up. A technical fault with another guests room, but no apology and no information, not once but twice!

The party and other parts of the event were lovely - good food, service and facilities - but the hotel room was pretty awful, mainly due to: - Virtually no storage space - just a tiny hanging cupboard, one shelf and no drawers - A stale smell of drains - A shower with minimal pressure and that would barely get above luke warm It did have a view of the Eifel Tower, but only if you went out on to the balcony and strained your neck. Otherwise the actual view was a huge running track and football field.   There was free wifi, but it was ridiculously slow - if you wanted high speed you had to pay for it.  There were also lifts that were desparately slow and inefficient, and often failed to stop",1,1

Thank goodness for the lovely Chablis that arrived with it but 100 euros for a couple of starters, a burger and a pasta. Would have been fine if the food was hot.   Worst of all the nasty restaurant manager, Her customer service skills were non-existent. She ruined my breakfast to the point I walked out.

Every girl dreams of waking up to the Eiffel Tower view on their honeymoon. However the minute we stepped foot into the Pullman, this dream came very close to crashing. After arriving in Paris, we took the metro to the accommodation, only to have the station required for the hotel stop closed. Poor signage and little direction made it very difficult to find. An email to give this information about closure and alternate means would have been great from the hotel.

Minutes from the Eiffel Tower and great views from the bedroom.  You couldn't ask for a better location yet...... Inefficient reception which created unnecessary waiting time at check-in.

First let me explain how their reception desk is, its a rectangular shaped table where you stand next to the employee & you can see everything on the computer which I found strange and guests doesn't know where to stand  because hotel staff are located all around that table and it just looks strange so people just don't",1,1

After I arrived at the Hotel they said the early check-in will cost me 60 Euro. I told them to talk to their Colleague who confirmed the early check-in. They denied!! After some time they found out about my Platinum Status and confirmed the early check-in. I received a room on the 1st Floor!! I told them that this is not acceptable for me but they didn't care. They offered me to wait 5 hours in the Lobby hoping that another room,1,1
"I reserved an Eiffel Tower view room at an increased price. The room we got had the tip of the tower visible and was a handicapped accessible room with no tub or shower curtain with a view of the ""garden"".   When I complained, I was offered a room down the hall for another 100$ with a more complete view. I said no but due to some miscommunication, I was billed anyway as I found out later.  I was told before I left it was corrected but have yet to see the correction. All this, took away from the great access to the tower and the river hop on hop off boat, otherwise would have been a good experience.  All in all, I feel cheated from a tourist trap-like hotel.",1,1
"I know the service in France is typically bad but I really expected more out of this hotel.  First we had a major issue with the online booking and some changes we had to make (basically the hotel reservation did NOT make the changes and did NOT send me the email changes and I luckily thought to call the night before as I was in the airport and had a minor panic), and then it seems an impossibility to get any kind of concierge service. I asked the front desk staff to help find out how we can get tickets up to the Eiffel Tower and they said you can't - so I basically had to go online and figure things out myself, when half the websites are in French. And then I wanted to book a train to Brussels, and again the front desk staff just pointed me to the computers nearby and suggested",1,1
"Actually the hotel is very nice, beautiful rooms very good place right next to the Tour Eiffel. But the whole staff is not trained in their workflows and unable to serve und satisfy all the guests. But for the high price they should do that. They had also problems with all the minibar fridges in the hotel (they get locked automatically). The housekeeping didn't replace all the shampoos and shower gels and so on. The worst thing however was that, we saw in the lobby around midnight on saturday just one guy from the hotel. Although the one didn't have too much to do, he didn't pick up the phone calls from the rooms. We asked him to send a technician for the fridge, but after 30 minutes we're still waiting. Then we tried to call the lobby but it was necessary to call them 4 times",1,1
"I usually never write any reviews, never in my life I felt so disappointed from a hotel service. The rooms were ok, good size and our room had a balcony. The third night of my stay we had leakage of water from the bathroom from the LIGHT BULB! YES! LIGHT BULB! Our complaint wasn't taken seriously and I had to call 5-7 times for someone from the reception to respond. They told us that they are changing our room, we were surprised to be taken to another smaller room on the same floor with no balcony and the room had a really small bathroom. We agreed, even though were disappointed from many things. The racist employees, the attitude, the way of talking and the overall treatment. Racism at a hotel? What kind of hospitality is this? You think everything ends here? no. The new rooms",1,1
"Ive had to put the worst rating because our experience was awful. My partners father sadly passed away and even with a copy of the death certificate, the hotel would not allow us to reschedule our booking and we paid a lot to stay there. Very appauled by their attitude and unhelpfulness.",1,1
"From the arrival to the check out this hotel has been a disaster with the service. Unprofessional check in and certainly not the expectation we should get as a regular visitor in Accor hotels group. You are asked to pay upfront 100% on the room with signature, they do not know what imprint of the credit card is about in this hotel. ... Looks like we would run away without paying our own bills. The staff at the check in and check out  is more a training center for students rather than a hotel where service should show French elegance. Looking at the location of the hotel right at the corner of the Eiffel Tower this shows once again that the French team in charge or should I say not in charge of the service displays the non professionalism. On top of the list of the worst team",1,1
"Stayed at the hotel with my wife for 7 nights, during a business trip. Other than the location, closed to the Eiffel Tower, this place is a catastrophe. Bizarre check-in area, overwhelmed staff, very long wait to get any attention. The hotel just doesn't care because they always will fill their room with tourists, whom for the main part will never return. Very expensive for what they offer. The rooms have a very small closet, no drawers anywhere and our clothes had to be left in our suitcases, which obviously, is not good when you need to attend professional events. The bathroom get totally flooded after a shower. More than 10 minutes waiting time for somebody at the service client to answer the phone. Yes, one good thing...they offer free Internet. A lot of hotels in Paris, if",1,1
"My colleague and me had a reservation of two rooms. Each of us received key to room which was occupied with other guest, and after going down to the reception, we received room which was not prepared.  Only the third attempt was ""success"".  My room was without air condition. I have asked 5 (!!!!!!!!) times to fix it. Every time the stuff promised to fix it, but they did not.  You can imagine how much time spent to reach the stuff ( no body is answering to phone calls), go down to the reception waiting for the stuff..  But the horrible thing was that the air condition was not fixed, and we suffered with sweating night!!!!! In the last attempt to request the fixing of the air condition I met a manager who was in the reception as well. But even this manager ( which was very kind),",1,1
"the title of this review is the only positive I can come up with.  Close to Eiffel Tower , some good restaurants, & docks for Seine boat rides.  Reception area is a hodge podge poorly marked & computers in an open area. Bellman dropped luggage off in room & disappeared before any explanations of  coffee machine, minibar, ice whereabouts. Room design is weird with NO drawers, & the tiniest closet ever.  We stayed 3 nights living out of & stumbling over suitcases,. No towel bars!  It got to be comical as we could not open minibar, employee came to room & said see Reception.  We did & their reply was we do not handle minibars! Next was a request for an item that took 4 hours & 4 phone calls to complete. all in all a poorly designed renovation, poorly trained staff.  No way a 4 star",2,1
"I walked through this hotel with my dog at 12:05 pm on 19th June.  The entrance of this hotel was under construction. Due to it, the road was narrowed and many guests were stationed btw entrance and this narrow road.  There was no other choice than I jumped in the grounds of this hotel to go through. But a woman employee's of this hotel who wear safety vest and tied up her hair was glaring indignantly at me and my dog. It was very unpleasant though this hotel's door man was very nice.",2,1
"The location is great, rooms are OK. Its downhill from there. Service is bad, slow and uninformed. When asked for directions i was told to take a cab to a place that was 0.3 miles away. Then i was told to walk to another place that was 3 miles away. Thank god for google maps, because the hotel staff was nice, but uninformed. The restaurant is mediocre, room service is slow (in fact it never came)... You can probably find somewhere better to stay for the price.",2,1
"I will start by saying this hotel has a fantastic location, steps away from the Eiffel tower and many restaurants/shops.  This hotel has also undergone a recent renovation so there are many areas that you can tell are not quite finished.  The renovation is going for a very modern feel but maybe too modern, it feels very sterile and cold.  The choices of some of the modern touches in the rooms just does not make since for maintenance and lasting quality.  During my stay it was very difficult to obtain any service at the front desk and something as simple as getting my TV to work required 6 phone calls, notified someone is on their way and they never came.  I also took this issue directly to the front desk and to no avail my TV still revealed an error message for the housekeeping",2,1
"My wife and I had the bad luck to stay here for three nights as part of a ""Tauck Tour"".  About the only good thing to say about this horror house is that they offer free internet access in the lobby. The first day three individuals from our tour had their luggage stolen between being taken off the tour bus and given to Hotel staff for delivery to our rooms!  The open baggage was later found with items missing on a unguarded stairwell!   The rooms themselves look as if they were modeled after a jail cell.  Modern, gray, concrete-like with a dark dirty look. A small, and a mean SMALL closet that make a closet on a cruise ship seem super LARGE.  No drawers to put your clothes away.  A stark look that only a blind person could appreciate.  The TV is next to impossible to operate.",2,1
"No closet space, rude staff who took took more than an hour and a half to bring a luggage rack and some other items.  When they finally brought the luggage rack they forgot the other items.  Location to the Eiffel Tower is nice and that is about it.  Electricity went out and when I went to their make shift front desk to let them know, they all of a sudden couldn't speak English and there was not a manager on duty.  Horrible horrible for the money. Not worth the money, will not be returning.  Close to the Eiffel Tower an absolutely nothing else.",1,1
"We stayed in this hotel and someone entered our room and stole my laptop. A few of the other tourists also had the same fate and the money in their safe was stolen as well. Very bad security . They said they have record that someone entered the room but have no idea who was it.  When we request the manager , miss linda to accompany us to the police station as We cant speak french , she refused. Instead she said we can file police report online and she will follow up for us to get the final report for insurance claim. After we returned to singapore, we did not hear from her anymore. When we wrote emails to her, she told us she cannot get the report for us. Wr will never stay in this hotel again.",1,1
"The hotel , The estruture was perfect ! Beautiful , elegant, very good localitation . Very good food in the restaurant !  But the service (the people )very big mass ! I think it's e its new hotel . It's left integration and service to pleasure costumers .",1,1
"I stayed here sevral years back when it was the Hilton. At that time, I did have a balcony where if I turned and looked to the side  I could see the Eiffel Tower. Meh. There's a lot more to Paris then staring at the tower. My friend and I walked around forever to try to find a restaurant. The one we found was totally mediocre but the only place open. The next day we tried to go shopping but there is nothing nearby. We checked out and headed to the Marriott. I can't comment on the rooms but I'm surprised people think the location is great. Just because you can see the Eiffel Tower ? I'd rather be near shops and restaurants.",1,1
"I arrived at the Pullman Eiffel Tower Hotel, Paris, France, on 4/29/14, for a personal stay and celebrating of my 26th wedding anniversary.  I was greeted and assisted by a young woman named Ann/Anne, who advised me all the hotel renovations had been completed. I had researched the property prior to my visit, which I had been planning for the past year and I knew the hotel was being renovated. I was under the impression that all rooms had been completed but the restaurant was not open, but 24 hour room service was available.  So, I was very happy to hear that all renovations had been completed and the restaurant was now open, as my vacation package included breakfast daily.  I must note that during our entire stay, the only front desk staff who spoke to us or assisted us was",2,1
"Our second time here. First time our bathroom got flooded during the night. The hotel was in renovation at the time, so we were not too surprised by this. But we had a major surprise on how bad the situation was handled by the staff. It took 3 hours to sort out a new room. At night, with a child sleeping, this was not fun.  Now that the renovations are over we said we give it another try.  Rooms are much better now but the service quality is not.  We again needed a change of rooms, this time for personal reasons. Two hours later, it finally worked out.  So much precious time wasted waiting for a room.  Such a pity that the customer service standards cannot be renovated.  But the location is unbeatable. Best in town if you have kids who are keen to see the Eiffel  Tower.",1,1
The morning of our departure to Paris  (!) we received a phone call from the hotel that they would close for a couple of months. They offered us an alternative hotel but that one was far inferior to Hotel Duette. No compensation at all.,1,1
"Rooms and breakfast area is very small, Hotel is not family friendly (only good for couples or singles), employess don`t give you a welcome feeling, Not a good value for money, Area around the hotel is very nice, Its very close to all points of interest!",2,1
"We were 2 Adults and few months old baby, we booked a classic room and when we arrived all classic rooms were full and they had only 1 higher categoty room. Instead of just upgrading us coz they dont have the booked category, they said we must pay the difference and used the baby then as a reason(extra person) for this when i refused to pay. I asked to cancel the booking but they also refused and said i wont b refunded. so i had either to pay the difference or lose the whole money i paid. With a baby who needs to sleep i had to pay. They started to negotiate then like in bazzar! Started with 60€/ night till 35 €/night was reached!",1,1
"We checked in the hotel and were given room no 17 on the first floor.  Next day early morn, there are painters working in the corridor. The smell of paint and consequently the new wallpaper installation with its glue made the entire stay intolerable for us to sleep at night with excessive weeZing and breathing issues due to the asthma.   Informing the reception and emailing them the very next day was pointless, as neither dis they change our room nor did the stop their renovation work. The result was that our entire trip was ruined with sleepless nights.   Neither does the bathroom exhaust work.  Overall would never recommend the hotel.",1,1
"Let me start out by saying that the staff at Le Mareuil is absolutely wonderful. Everyone we interacted with was friendly and incredibly helpful - I just wish that the other aspects of the hotel had been on the same level as its employees. My husband and I checked into Le Mareuil on 1/1 for the second half of our stay in Paris, with a reservation for 8 nights. Upon entering our room, we were hit with the very noticeable and unpleasant stench of mildew coming from the bathroom. I tried airing out the room, but unfortunately it didn't make a difference. There were a few other issues with our room, but the biggest problem was the wifi. It worked for about 20 minutes and then stopped completely - a huge problem for both myself and my husband who had work and numerous emails to",2,1
"Upon our arrival on an early Saturday afternoon, we were walking down the narrow sidewalk next to this hotel before arriving at the entrance, and we sidestepped what looked like 3 low-level hotel staff lounging on a door stoop and standing around on the sidewalk, smoking cigarettes and hanging out, avoiding eye contact. We go inside, and now, behold! - we see that this same threesome are the ""professionals"" that are there to greet us at our 4-star hotel! And it went downhill from there. We'd prepaid for our room over a month in advance (and been billed and paid for it too), and we had the complete confirmation email on my wife's iPhone to see, but the front desk manager insisted there was no record of our reservation. We were then made us go through a lengthy rigamarole before",2,1
"I first stayed in this hotel in September for couple of days with my husband. As the location fits me perfectly for what I have to do in Paris I came back again in January for another couple of days. The room was payed by my husband  via booking and his card was debited. At the arrival the lady at the reception  (probably a manager) (no ""good afternoon"", no ""welcome"", nothing !) asks me to present the card with which I payed. 10 minutes of annoying discussions  - me trying to explain to her that I do not have the card with me as it's my husband's card and that it is the first time it causes a problem and her speaking to me in a very impolite way and treating me as a fraudster while I'm visiting their establishment for the second time. Very “pleasant” welcome drink. We travel a",2,1
"Good location.Relatively close to the city center. Rooms are well designed. However, the breakfast is always the same and did not change once throughout our stay (6days, 7 nights). The rooms are small but afterall, you only need it to sleep. It is advertised that the rooms are soundproof but this is not the case. You can hear every step above your room and if someone in the room beside you is flushing the toilet or taking a shower. Apart from this, the hotel is good but I wouldn’t consider staying here again.",2,1
"With the ventilation/aircondition off the whole night, we didn’t get much sleep. We got 20 euros in discount after complaining (total nearly 160). In a hotel with otherwise a good standard we expect more. Never try to cover a flaw with silly explanations. Start with a simle sorry/pardon.",2,1
"Having been to Hotel Home Moderne before with a friend and having a pleasant stay I decided to book to stay again when travelling to Paris. However this time the hotel let itself down.   The room was small (you get what you pay for) and very warm and you could hear the noise of the lift dinging every time someone called it, or it arrived on the floor. We shortly discovered the bedding in our room was dirty, and brought it to the attention of the front desk, who assured us the room was clear but they would get someone to check it, and it would be dealt with by the time we got back to the room that evening. When we returned we were assured the problem had been fixed and were offered a free breakfast the next day. However when went to the room we discovered this new ""clean"" bedding",1,1
"a couple of things travellers should be warned about...or perhaps we were asking a bit too much for a two-star hotel. - no ironing board in the room as stated (if you dont have it, dont say you do) - no UK plug converter (instead they had a million other weird ones...but fail to have an UK one!?)  overall the staff is quite friendly and pleasant, so i give it two stars.",2,1
"We read ALL of the reviews, every single one was positive.  The Hotel's services sounded ideal for our holiday.    Internet, mini-safe & satellite tv.  One tripadvisor reviewer said they had BBC 1&2 - absolute perfection.   We don’t mind a walk to the bus or metro - our holidays consist of us walking a lot We must have entered a parallel universe. Arrived at the hotel but the room wasn’t ready, reception asked us to come back in an hour, we returned 90 minutes later and still the room wasn’t ready, eventually we got to room 401 which is set up for a single despite the double bed  - the giveaway being the one coffee cup, 1/2 a shelf in the wardrobe, the rest being used by the safe.  No BBC channels on the TV. Offered another room and 606 was more suited to a couple, but the safe",2,1
"Very small hotel room, reminding me of some very tightly spaced hotel rooms/apartments in New York & San Francisco.   We were there mid May. AC was off/disabled by the hotel because it wasn't considered necessary. So we had to open the windows to get air, even overnight. We were on the 5th floor, safe enough, but I was always afraid of who-knows-what could fly in.   Small bathroom with old shower curtain, which looked fine at first but smelled moldy after 1-2 use. If they just replaced the thing, we'd rate them 5/5 for cleanliness and for condition/upkeep (if they also placed screens on the windows).  No refrigerator in the room. Their website showed very little amenities info because there was none :( At least wi-fi worked without extra charge :) Laundromat was a 3-min walk",2,1
"We had a bad experience at this hotel.  The air conditioning did not work and when we reported it to the management they said they would quickly take care of it, which they did not.  Because we had booked for three days, we asked for another room, they said they were full.  Three nights with no air conditioning, not good!",1,1
My wife and i booked 01 night stay. We though we will continue the stay if we like the hotel. At reception they have given us the key. when we opened the room we realized that it was too small. we went down to reception and asked him to give us another room. He has given us the key but he told us that it is almost the same size and he was absolutely right. We decided to be in the hotel as it was 11:30 in the night.   The hotel is far from the city. the first thing in the morning is checking out as we can't stay in such a small room. People who are interested in Nightlife or walk around stay away...,2,1
I had horrible experience upon checking in with hotel staff Alexandria. Booked a room for two adults. Last minute my sister brought her one year old infant. The hotel denied us a room because we had a baby. Was told the baby is considered a third person and the room was booked for two adults. Although we didn’t ask for a crib or baby bed. We were told they didn’t have a room to accommodate a baby. Instead of helping as at first she immediately told as to go find a different hotel. I had already prepaid for the room for the duration of five days. It was unbelievable how rude she was about as bringing a baby. I understand if it was a child but it was in infant that sleeps with her mother. I argued for about an hour about the situation. We had flew in on 14 hour journey. As you can,1,1
"First a back story ... 2 weeks prior to our arrival, I emailed the hotel to let them know that we were celebrating our 25th anniversary and I was hoping if possible, if we could get a room with a romantic view and as a surprise to my husband something special to be placed in the room. We had booked/ paid for a standard room, so I wasn't expecting an upgrade to a suite but something special would be a nice touch.  They emailed back, stating that they have a romantic package for 49E including a bottle of champagne, flowers etc.. That wasn't the answer I was looking for but c'est la vie and decided to leave it at that.  (this was only a one night stay for us before heading back home)  Upon check in we were told that an upgrade was not available,  I was little disappointed  but",2,1

Upon arrival, I was told by the lady at the front desk that they were oversold because another person decided to extend his stay??!! As a result, they put me in their sister property down the street for the night.   Overall, very disappointed that the hotel and room I reserved was not available. Beware of this happening to you as I booked this hotel solely because of the good reviews...",1,1
"We had stayed at this hotel during 2014 and despite being toward the budget end of the market had a good stay. Unfortunately this hotel has deteriorated massively. Terrible room service, only left with 1 towel in a double room and despite requesting TWICE for another towel, nothing was made available. Room very small and stuffy, no fan or air conditioning, the only window opened onto brick work. It's a real shame but I'd advise that everyone gives this place a miss.",1,1
"Myself and two friends booked one night in this hotel. Looking through the photos on Tripadvisor we thought we'd found a bargain,  On arrival we were met by a man at the reception who said we'd arrived early (on our booking we'd specified that we would arrive at 7pm however we arrived at 5pm) he was quite rude about the whole thing and told us we would be given a ""basic"" room because we'd arrived early.  This ""basic"" room was possibly the worst hotel room I've ever stayed in, the beds were old and worn out, the bathroom was a box retrofitted into the room and it just felt horrible. We had paid almost £100 for the pleasure.  Overall:  - Poor Service (I must blame my poor French as well but he did not help matters) - Room was not what we'd paid for - Top floor with no lift   I",2,1
"This is by far the worst hotel I have stayed in. I am really puzzled by the amount of good reviews this hotel has received. It was terrible. Here are some thoughts:  Pros:  **Good Location. Close to public transportation, lovely restaurants, etc..  Cons: ** Rude receptionist. I was literally greeted by a snort and rolling eyes as I arrived earlier than the check-in time due to the early arrival of my international flight. He then proceeded to try to push the shuttle service for my return to the airport and ATTEMPTED TO CHARGE ME 8 EUROS MORE PER PERSON THAN WHAT THE HOTEL HAD LISTED. I'm assuming he was going to pocket the difference. Unbelievable!  ** Rooms were so small you can only fit one suitcase in there. Bathrooms were tiny as well. You can hear everything through the",1,1
"We stayed in the Hotel des Arts for a weekend last autumn. I had previously stayed and enjoyed it immensely, but was very disappointed this time. The positives - it's right in the centre of Montmartre, just across from a famous arthouse cinema and metres away from a great bar and a wonderful Italian restaurant. It's not far from Abbesses metro station and fairly easy to find. We were disappointed though by the awful customer service. On checking in we were greeted by a miserable, dour receptionist who was most concerned with warning us not to take keys outside the hotel. We were given a room which stank of cigarette smoke, and when my partner went down to ask to change rooms, he was told that we could only change if I had not sat down on the bed or used the toilet.

"We recently stayed at Hotel des Arts in April, finishing our 10 day European trip in which we stayed at two different hotels in Rome and Venice (a 3 and 4 star respectively) and unfortunately this hotel, our last visit, was the least enjoyable.   First, let me say the hotel is in a great location, that was the most appealing aspect of the hotel. There is plenty to see nearby and no shortage of nice restaurants and cafes. The Moulin Rouge is in walking distance and most of the major attractions in Paris are a short cab/bus ride away.  When we first arrived to the hotel we were greeted and given our key to the room, the gentlemen informed us that we had not chosen the daily breakfast (through the travel agency) but could dine there and pay the 11 euro per person daily fee if we",2,1
"Almost everything about this hotel was great BUT it was all undermined by the complete mis-selling of an 'Eiffel Tower view' (only bookable through their website direct). I thought this sort of practice only went on in shabby beach hotels claiming to have a sea view on the basis that only a small bit of sea can be seen from the room...but apparently it happens in €150 Paris hotels too.   I booked the Eiffel Tower room for a romantic break with my wife having looked at the website and seen images of the rooms, the communal areas and finally a picture of the Eiffel Tower across the city from the hotel. I assumed (perhaps wrongly) this would be the view we would get...alas no. No communal rooms would have had the view in the picture as the building was surrounded by buildings up to",2,1
"Charmy hotel in beautiful Montmartre close to Sacré Couer and Moulin Rouge. We booked a Superior Double room with an delightful view. But was ""no view"" and not a Superior room with extra squaremeters and extra ordinary design. In the reception worked a girl that couldnt tell us if we will get the right room for the next two nights. Read about this problems with overbooking and so on, but thought this were from the past. So be carefull by booking rooms at this hotel, and at least don't up grade, cause you don't get what you pay for. And they couldnt give us the breakfast as a compensation for this night that will not be as suspected.",2,1
"Stayed for 3 nights for the annual arc weekend.  Intial thoughts were how friendly and helpful the staff were, in fact i would rate their helpfulness as 5 star.  Fantastic spot to stay highly recommend staying in the area and i will review the restaurants in another post. However, the room we were given on the ground floor was the problem.   Not because it was too small i expected that and it was, that aside it was clean and everything worked fine no problems. These started in the middle of the night when people from other rooms flushed their toilets, it seemed that the waste pipe run through the back of our bathroom.

"This hotel has 6 floors - 5 of which are accessible by lift, the 6th is only accessible via a narrow spiral staircase. It is quite difficult to get normal-sized luggage up those stairs.  The hotel sent us an e-mail stating that they were planning renovations due to previous customer comments - I can only imagine those customers stayed in the same room as us. The room was sufficient for our 1-night stay, but in order to be able to open the door to the room or to the bathroom, we had to stack all of our luggage on top of each other (there is absolutely no floor space in this room - the entire room is taken up by the hard-as-a-rock double bed and a tiny desk). The bathroom had no shower curtain or glass barrier, and thus water got all over the place - which is probably why there",2,1

However, on arrival we were told the hotel was overbooked and we would be staying in an apartment near Sacre Coeur . I explained that breakfast was included in my booking but they had no record of it. Fortunately I had my e-mail confirmation but as were not staying there it would have meant going there every morning. They gave me a discount of 21 euros for the 3 days which really wasn't acceptable.

"This is one of the worst (but not the worst hotel by far) I and friends have stayed in. The rooms continually filled with the smell of tobacco from other rooms despite allegedly being a non-smoking hotel. I continually complained but management were laissez faire and if one can't abide by tobacco smoke which filled the hall ways of every room (like a smell of class debasement and poverty) one will hate it here. As I did. The balcony door was open to the room 24/7 to get rid of it, which worked, but, as it was winter you can imagine the absolute horror of permanent cold that entailed. I would also find myself often RUSHING down the stairs to get out of the smell.  Bathroom toiletries offered were poor and just smelled generically of random fruit and there was no bottled water",1,1
"We stayed in this hotel for a week in October. We knew it was described as small but that just doesn't describe the facilities.  As a rule of thumb I think a traveller should expect an adult bed. My husband and I were given a twin room. The beds were not singles! They were so narrow, what I would describe as a child's bed, that when you turned in your sleep you fell out. This meant we were waking up 3 or 4 times per night to turn over. The mattress also had a rubber cover on it which tended to rumple under you as you turned. This also made you overheat. Our room had a window which opened onto an internal shaft. As there was no air conditioning and the room was so hot, we had to have the window open. Not surprisingly everyone seemed to do the same. Unfortunately smokers thought",2,1
"We booked this hotel as many reviews reported it as being quiet and favourable in other respects. However our experience I am afraid directly contradicted this. Hotel des Arts is located in a narrow, steepish street, bustling with people at all times of the day and night.  The reception was friendly enough, the room was very small and dark with poor lighting - quite claustrophobic; the shower even smaller (perhaps the smallest cubicle I have ever used). There was no mirror or proper lighting in the bedroom so we had to share the mirror in the bathroom for hair, shaving, make-up and every other luxury!  The room overlooked a very small dark square of a yard. The daylight was somewhere up above. This wasn't a problem; what was a problem was that during the night the moving of what",2,1
"This was my 7th trip to Paris, but the first time I'd stayed in Montmartre (which is a lovely arrondissement - I'd definitely stay in this part of town again...but in a different hotel).  Clearly this hotel has gotten a lot of positive feedback so I think it meets the needs of a certain group of travelers...a group that I do not belong in.  I prefer hotels that do not have mold growing in the shower; towels that are less than threadbare and a staff that at least pretends to be helpful.  Typically, I book my hotel at least a month in advance and I contact the concierge to work out some dinner reservations.  In this case, I booked almost 2 months in advance.  The concierge acknowledged my inquiry about a dinner reservation at Frenchie (notoriously difficult to get in to) but never",2,1
"We spent 4 nights at the hotel mainly on the recommendations on TA - all I can say is it's not the worst hotel we have ever stayed at, but it comes pretty close. We had a room on the 5th floor, room 54 which was supposed to be a superior room, i have no idea why, the room measured 12' x 10' with twin beds and a view from the window of room 53 and the back of the lift. Storage space was almost nonexistent, 2 single wardrobes either side of the beds, which consisted of a hanging space which was just about tall enough to hang a shirt or a skirt and 3 narrow shelves, one of which had the room safe fitted into it and the other 2 had spare pillows and blankets. So the blankets and pillows had to be put on the floor with our cases so we could store our clothes away. All around the room",2,1
"I paid an additional supplement to have a superior room to help celebrate a belated Christmas treat only to find our Chambre Superieur was the size of a postage stamp and one could not swing a proverbial cat in it! We complained and after two days we were moved to a much larger room, which was lovely! In the UK we would call this a misrepresentation of fact and no apology or compensation was offered! The hotel in general is very good, enjoying an excellent location. Had we not been fluent in the French Language, i don't think we would have been moved and just ignored! Would i return? I think i probably would, providing i was given what i had expected to receive. They just didn't do what is says on the tin!",2,1
"We booked our trip  with Cresta holidays. That was fine can't fault them, but the hotel was supposed to be ****+ in their brochre so we expecteded the standard to be really good. There were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room,no air conditioning, it was very small,their was no bracket to hang the shower head on, there was a safe in the wardrobe but as the over ride code was printed on the instructions it was hardly secure. we were on the 3rd floor and the window opened on to a very small utility area, there was a door from the reception area that opened in to this place and at night the receptionists had it open, we didn't go to to bed very early the first night but were kept awke by first off all 2 girls singing and then a man walking about coughing. as this area",2,1
"After reading excellent reviews on this hotel, we were very disappointed with our stay. The  room is tiny and you don't even have room for your legs when sitting on the toilet. The wifi internet system was barely working and the service is not good at all. Not recommended.",1,1
"The service was good, the room neat, but he manager and some staff were rude and condescending, not helpful in follow through. We had a room next to a street so it was noisy all the time. The manager in particular was rude and not at all helpful both during our stay and in correspondence later. The hotel was actually in a poor location away from many major sites whcih makes for  too much time traveing mainly on the subway.",2,1
"Booked Hotel des Arts  for 23-26 March from  good reviews on various travel sites. E-mailed hotel prior to departing and they  replied that the booking was OK. On arriving was told that the room was been “renovated!!” and that I  was booked into another hotel in the area. On apology, nothing. Seemed like this was normal procedure for them.. On investigation on Trip Advisor forum it seems that this hotel is notorious for “walking” people to other hotels in the area!! . This hotel seems to be a victim of it`s own success as it only has 30 rooms? . Be aware,book this hotel at your peril",1,1
"Having read some of the reviews regarding both overbooking’s and not so good rooms I sent 2 e-mails prior to our arrival asking for a room with a view and not to overbook me, neither got a reply.  As I am a travel agent this did not instil me with confidence, anyone who works in a service industry should at least have the courtesy to reply.  On arrival we were given the key to room 20, made our way up and found this to be a very small drab room, the view was the wall opposite so there was no natural light. I would have put up with it for 1 night but not for 4, so I went down to reception and asked to be moved.  Eventually offered room 4 which overlooked a courtyard and we could at least see the sky. Unpacked our bags and settled in for our much awaited break.   Had a look",2,1
"In June, I booked one night at Hotel Des Arts for 13 September.  Of course, on 12th September, Eurostar's tunnel caught fire and services were suspended.  Eurostar agreed to refund, but not so Hotel Des Arts.  Their cancellation date was given as Septenmber 8th and despite protestation that there really was nothing I could have done about the situation they refused to refund the £81.52 cost.  Eventually, they offered to give me one night free in the new year, provided I stayed there for a minimum of 3 nights - not what i was looking for.  I will go to Paris in 2009, I certainly won't be booking Hotel Des arts.",1,1
We booked a room at this hotel based on guidebook reviews and some tripadvisor reviews that referred to it as a friendly well run hotel representing good value in Montmartre. The rooms on the website looked fine. Despite having booked directly with the hotel nearly 5 months earlier we were told on arrival that they were overbooked  but  we could be accomodated elsewhere in Paris for the night.  I had heard of this scam before and had it tried on us in Rome only to find on insistence that there were indeed rooms available1When I insisted that we stay  where we had booked the reception manager was aggressive but gave us the room next to the reception desk. We were on the last day of a 7 week trip and already had a shuttle bus booked for return to the airport next day so we had no,1,1
"We booked through Eurostar. Arrived at the hotel, no room available. Told to go to another hotel 10 minutes walk away. Do not book this hotel you will not get a room.",1,1
"We first booked this hotel in July 2005 through an agent, when we arrived we were given a story about flood damage on 3rd and 4th floor and were sent to another hotel down the road. Thinking this was unfortunate we booked the hotel again through expedia for one night in July 2007. Between booking and travelling we saw the reviews mentioning about the flood damage scam -- so we were prepared. Nevertheless we were still total gobsmacked to arrive at the hotel to be greeting with 'I have bad news and good news'. The reception seemed slightly shocked when we said ' let me guess you have flood damage on the 4th floor'. We told him in no uncertain terms that we didn't believe him, that we'd paid for a room in this hotel and we'd appreciate him finding us one. At this point he tried to",1,1
"I had booked a room at this hotel's website before seeing the various posts warning of the ""bait-and-switch"" scam.  The warnings so unnerved me that I immediately sent an email to the hotel, asking them to confirm my booking.  In response, I got....nothing.  I sent another email to the void, then finally called up the hotel. A receptionist told me very briskly that their booking site had been down, which is why she had ignored my emails but that she would be book me a room and send me an email.  Several days later, having not yet received email confirmation, I called back and spoke to a different person who confirmed my booking.  And, finally, finally, I received email confirmation. After all this back-and-forth for a simple confirmation, I was convinced that no room would be",2,1
"Booked two months in advance with lastminute.com, then got fobbed off with the ""water damage"" story as seen in other reviews here! Amazed that they keep getting away with it. They offered a place in the Kyriad hotel, but when checking the rooms, found it to be awful, so demanded another hotel elsewhere. After about an hour of phonecalls, finally got placed at the Carlton.  This is obviously a common scam. BEWARE WHEN BOOKING.  If you still choose to take your chances, be prepared to be sent elsewhere!",1,1
"As one writer below put it, we got the old ""bait and switch"" pulled on us. The disinterested clerk waved her hand and said a water pipe burst (yeah, right) and we had to go find our other hotel which was ""just down the hill.""  We demanded a cab and 18 euros later we were at our other hotel quite far away in a seedy part of town. When we got to the Hotel des Arts the next day, the same female clerk couldn't be bothered to open the baggage room and made us leave our luggage in the hall for 4 hours for anyone to steal. When I tried to make a local call with the courtesy phone she actually hung the phone up on my call, and on and on and on. When we finally saw our room...3 Star Hotel? I don't think so. Everyone we spoke to said they couldn't believe that rating. Some American",1,1
"Booked a two day trip for myself and husband through expedia on eurostar and picked this hotel before checking out reviews on this site. Was a bit apprehensive that we would not  get a room and now wish we had been moved... The area round the hotel is really nice with lots of cafes and shops including about 3 bakeries.. The hotel entrance is ok and the staff were quite friendly and helpful but the room ""oh dear"" The only way I can describe the size is think of a shoe box... we had two single beds that I am sure were only 2ft6 and very hard, a small table fixed to the wall, a wardrobe and french windows opened into the room so then you had to climb over the beds to get to the bathroom, no mirror in the bedroom only  on the bathroom door. As for the bathroom it was even smaller,",1,1
"DO NOT GO HERE. Husband and I were subject to fraudulent practices. Hotel Des Arts ook our money and our booking [through last minute.com], got there, told us room wasn't available and tried to send us on our way to crummy 1-2 start dump down the street, which we walked to on our own and had graphiti in the lift. Suprising, or not, it was owned by the same guy as Hotel Des Arts. Gather he pays for renovations on that dump by kicking people they over booked to the crummy place, but charging them 3 star fees. Went back to try and just get our money back [they wouldn't hand over] and they tried to kick us to a hotel in the suburbs.   Really *impressed* when someone in the lobby gives us a document off a website saying this 'water damage' excuse for lack of room and shove off to",1,1
My husband and I were booked into Hotel Des Arts via our local travel agent who found this hotel from Escape who are based at Manchester.  We travelled from Charles de Gaulle airport on the Air France coach to the AF bus stop and then travelled on the Metro for five stops only to be be told when we arrived at the hotel that due to flooding there was no room for us and that they had booked us in a hotel nearby.  The hotel they had booked us in was five Metro stops away.  It all turned well for us as the hotel was near the Arc de Triomphe and was more central.  The hotel we stayed was called Hotel Niel on Rue Leroy and was excellent.,1,1
"Sorry to be another traveller to have a bad experience to share about this hotel but my advice is, do not touch it.   We arrived at the hotel only to be told by the desk clerk  Alain, that the hotel had problems with electrics, water, you name it and that we would have to be given alternative accommodation.   Needless to say he was charming at this point. The alternative was absolutely dreadful and when we went back to the Des Arts and said it was unacceptable, Alain became very hostile and rude. He eventually got us into another hotel but he basically told us to like it or lump it as it wasn't his job to find us alternative accommodation. Literally we were left with no choice.  I would say that Paris is a great city and with so many other hotels to choose from, it would be best",1,1
"Like some of the other reviewers, we too fell victim to the overbooking problem.   On arrival for a 3 night stay, we were told that the room was flooded, but not to mind as we were to be directed to another, better hotel nearby.  As it turned out, the better hotel was a grotty hotel miles away from Montmatre on a busy street. And we weren't alone, 3 other couples had been directed to the same grotty hotel.  The staff were unapologetic and wouldn't provide for a complimentary transfer to the second hotel.  All in all a very disappointing, frustrating experience.  It seems as though success breeds complacency for this hotel and I wouldn't trust that they would honour any future bookings.",1,1
"I booked this hotel over the Easter weekend for a romantic break for my girlfriend and myself. Booked about a month in advance, initially through a website called Parishotels. I paid a deposit, but recieved no confirmatory email. I then contacted the hotel direct who told me that everything was in order.  However, as I wanted to make sure everything was going to run smoothly, I checked again in both French and English to be sure there was no misunderstanding, a week or so later, just to be sure my booking was confirmed, and was reassured that it was.  I then recieved an email from Des Arts two days before we were due to stay there (bearing in mind it was the Easter Bank Holiday, a busy time in Paris to say the least) telling me that due to 'renovations' our room was unavailible,",1,1
"I booked for easter holydays for two nights with two months in advance and the day before my leaving from Italy I called them to know if everything was ok: they said YES !. At my arrival the man before me was destinated to another location because of problem at the 5th floor...I began to get angry and when I reached the reception Alain told me :"" don't worry everything is ok....but you should go to another hotel !!!"". I replied:"" WHAT ? I called yesterday, I paid advance with credit card and now you say that I have to go to another hotel ?"" fortunately when he told me the name of the other hotel I remember that it was better than Des Arts (it was The Cardinal) and so I accepted told to Alain that if there'll be only a little problem I came back immediately to him.  It's anyway",2,1
"I booked this hotel for four nights beginning tonight (December 8th) for my brother and his partner Helen. I just texted him to see how check-in went - he replied ""Alain tried to tell us we had to go to another hotel, but Helen gave him what for, and we got our room'.  This is obviously a regular scam they try and pull, but insist and hopefully you will get your room too.  The hotel itself is good he said.",2,1
"Despite booking a 4 night stay well over a month in advance, when we arrived we were told that due to a computer crash a week before, the hotel had lost all it's booking details. We were told that they had tried to contact all the agents they deal with, in order to find out who had booked and to be able to notify them. We were not contacted and had no prior notice. We find it very difficult to believe that efforts were made as we had booked the holiday through Eurostar, which you think would have been one of the first on the list. Very disappointing as we were transfered to a hotel some considerable distance away, not of the superior standard promised and on a busy and noisy street. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",1,1
"Yes we were also ""stitched up"" - our first trip overseas to Paris. Unfortunately I left Paris as soon as I could from this experience. After about 19 hours travelling only to find that the room was not available was not very pleasant",1,1
"Do not go there! I booked this hotel for my husband, our ten year old daughter and myself 3 months in advance. The booking was made directly by me via email with the hotel - in French.I made it explicit that we were travelling with a child. We chose HdA because friends had stayed there in the past with their daughter and really loved it and its location. We were booked for a week and arrived to be told computer problems and room flooding meant our room was no longer available - but that we had been booked into Hotel Andre Gill ""in the centre of Montmartre"", a ""more expensive hotel but offering the same price as a special favour"". Needless to say HAG was in a seedy location, incredibly noisy at night with incredibly uncomfortable beds. payment was rudely demanded in advance and",1,1
"My friend and I booked a twin room through GTS Travel for this hotel.  We arrived at the hotel at 1pm - after long trip from US. The receptionist informed us that our room was not ready and would not be ready until 2:30pm.  We sat for awhile and overheard a lady inquiring about the hotel rooms asking to see one.  The receptionist stated that the rooms could not be shown until tomorrow at 11am; the lady became insistant saying that she expected to stay from 10-15 nights.  The answer was still No! My friend and I went out for awhile returning at 2:25pm and asked to check in. Caroline, the rude receptionist said No! - must wait 5 more minutes.  Meanwhile she checked in 2 people who came in after us.  Finally she checked us in to a tiny room with a double bed.  I returned to",1,1
"The stories I am finding here sound all too familiar. We arrived in the afternoon, booking in hand, and were told that they had had a terrible problem when their computer crashed, causing them to loose all their reservations. Unfortunately, among them was ours, so would we mind being upgraded to the Hotel Du Casino, a three star hotel instead of two, and just a ten-minute walk from Des Arts? Unsuspectingly, we agreed, only to find ourselves farmed out to a run down place, about a twenty-minute walk away (with luggage) on a busy street. This seems certainly their way of operating: the owners run Des Arts as a flagship, and syphon off the bookings to less desirable hotels. I will contact our travel agent and suggest they discontinue doing business with these crooks.",1,1
"Booked a double on the weekend of the France v England Rugby International through Eurostar 'Short Breaks'.  Staff said that they expected us the following month and shifted us to another hotel in Rue Amsterdam.  Determined to stay at the Hotel des Arts I booked on the internet a few months later.  On arrival I was told that the hotel does not deal with the company through which I had booked and I was, again, moved to another hotel. Never again!!!",1,1
"Despite booking well in advance through a reputable travel agent (Thomas Cook Signature), we too were shunted to another, far inferior, hotel for our first night in Paris.  I had read about the booking scam on TripAdvisor but never thought I'd be unlucky enough for it to happen to me.  I couldn't have been more wrong!  On arrival at the Des Arts the bald receptionist Alain (who seems to have featured in other poor reviews...) told us that due to a computer crash they had lost our booking and had no room for us.  We put up a fight but he insisted that we stay at the Mont Dore, their sister hotel, which he described as 'charming, more expensive' and even told us they would give us their best room.  However, we arrived to a teeny tiny room on a busy road well outside of the centre",2,1
"My husband, brother and I booked a 2 night break at this hotel on 14 May 2005 via Air Miles (to be taken in September).  One double and one single room were confirmed. Reading of the alleged scam going on at HdA, I contacted Air Miles who were unaware of any problem and, in any case, said the hotel had the contract with them and they thought it was unlikely I would be bounced and, therefore, reassured me.  However, when we turned up, the receptionist told us there was a problem ""because Air Miles had made a mistake with the booking"" and because there was a big event in Paris, they had overbooked and they had no triple rooms for us (this was the first I heard of a triple room being booked by anyone).  The young  lady said she had ""searched Paris"" and found us accommodation at",1,1
"we booked this hotel through a well reputed dutch travel agency (Sunair). After reading the many reports about overbooking I sent them an email 2 days before our departure asking a confirmation of my booking. Sine I did not get a reply I called them one day in advance. The guy from the reception replied that I had a reservation for 4 nights, so I assumed that everything would be OK...NOT! Upon arrival the very same guy I talked to on the phone (a young bald guy called Alain, watch out for him) STILL came up with the usual story about the ""inexperienced employee who had made a mistake"" . As a result we would have to spend the first night in another hotel. I got furious and there followed a long and unfriendly conversation. I made it clear that what upset me most was the fact that",1,1
"To be realistic I cannot write an accurate review of the Hotel Des Arts itself seeing as I was unable to stay in it.  Upon arrival at the Hotel I was very pleased. It look warm and clean, if quite small, and was not disappointed by its appearance. I had read reviews of the Hotel warning tourists about the over-booking scam and though I was wary, I did not believe it would happen to me.   However, after giving the Hotel our details they told us that they has accidentally over-booked due to 'a new receptionist' (presumably the same 'new' receptionist that over-books everyone else). I knew immediately it was a scam but due to a language barrier I could not really do anything.   We were relocated to a so-called 3star hotel. Yet the new hotel was dirty and badly situation and",1,1
We have just returned from a week in Paris which was amazing. The hotel was in a great location but the staff where all very rude. We had problems from as soon as we arrived at the hotel. Being quite sick and exhausted from an 18 hour flight we wanted to check-in as soon as possible but we weren't allowed into our room until 3:00pm even though it was ready when we got there just before from 12:00pm. There was no compassion at all.,2,1
The practice of being shunted on to other hotels in Paris is alive and kicking at Hotel des Arts - interestingly no longer a member of Logis de France!  You could well find yourselves in the shoes of many travellers before you if you book this Hotel. Do so at your peril!!  My son & daughter gave my husband and I an all expenses paid visit to Paris including the excellent travel provided by 1st Class Eurostar. We arrived in Paris on May 6th for 3 nights.  After carrying our heavy baggage from Gare du Nord and using the Metro we then walked to Rue Tholoze and to the hotel.  On arrival we too were given the pathetic spiel about the 'new & inexperienced receptionist' and shunted off to Hotel du Mont Dore - this hotel being inferior and way out of Montmartre! The room we had was on,1,1
"On arrival, we were sent by taxi to another hotel (Hotel du Mont Dore) with very little explanation and no apology.  The man on reception mumbled something about a new receptionist messing up, but I've since read a review on this website of exactly the same thing happening to someone else last year.  It seems to be a regular scam.  Not the best start to a weekend in Paris!",1,1
"No matter how good this hotel sounds, its business practices are outrageously dishonest!  Although I had read some of the negative reviews in advance, the positive descriptions of the hotel were so compelling, I took a risk.  Big mistake.   I booked this hotel through a reputable website - one which I have used to book many other hotel rooms in France and UK.  I have never had a problem.  When I showed up at Hotel Des Arts, my reservation had clearly been separated in a pile with a couple of others.   I was told my reservation did not exist,  that the hotel booking website was disreputable and had simply booked me into Hotel des Arts though a reservation was never arranged there.     The receptionist made a big show about booking me in another hotel up the street - a shoddy,",1,1
"I booked this hotel rationalising that all of the customers that got turned away booked or arrived too late or never received a 'confirmed guaranteed booking confirmation'.  However, all of the reviews about 'inexperienced receptionists overbooking' were spot-on.  I could have finished the sentences of the bald-headed man at Des Arts reception for him because I had heard them so often at this site.  However, he claimed all was not lost as he had a 3 star hotel also in Montmartre that would charge us the same rate as Des Arts.  Unfortunately, the Hotel Du Mont Dore was not a 3-star hotel, was not in Montmartre, was on a busy road, was noisy till early morning, and had a toilet that I couldn't sit straight on because there was nowhere to put my legs!  It was clean and close enough",1,1
"We booked the hotel through a travel agency (NS Travel) in Holland. We had already read reports on this and other sites about the overbooking problems associated with Hotel des Arts but booked anyway in the assumption that booking through a travel agency would make a difference.   At first we believed this assumption to be true because after arriving on sunday at 2 PM we got our room. But when we checked out on friday afternoon we witnessed the overbooking with our own eyes. Another dutch couple, who had booked with the same travel agency were given the old and known excuse that an unexperienced hotel employee had mistakingly overbooked the hotel and that they had to move to another hotel. We talked to them (in dutch) and told them about the overbooking reputation of this hotel",1,1
"I booked this hotel in September 2004 through Eurostar Holidays direct.  After reading reviews on this website, I emailed the hotel directly to ensure that they were aware of our booking and asked them to ensure that we wouldn't be bumped.  They replied promptly and ensured us that there would be no problems.   On Thursday December 9th, we arrived at the hotel about midday to leave our bags. The receptionist informed us that they were overbooked and that they had no knowledge of our booking and we would need to be moved but not to worry they would get us a taxi.  I explained about the email but unfortunately hadn't taken a copy of their response.  After a lengthy confrontation they assured me that we could remain in that hotel and to come back and check in after 5pm.   I was",2,1

Upon arrival at the ""Hotel"", we were told that our reservation had been cancelled that morning ( whilst we were enroute ) because my credit card was invalid. It was not, we used it several times whilst in Paris with no problem. We booked through Active hotels and I must say they have been very helpful when we complained about the way we were treated, they have even taken the hotel off their list ( try and book !) We did however find a lovely hotel just down the road and we would recommend it, they even accepted my invalid credit card. Hotel Regyn's Montmartre was the name and it is very similar in price.",1,1
"I booked this hotel through Expedia, and in accordance with the rave reviews that have been posted.  My partner and I, after a long transatlantic flight were given the same line that a new receptionist had over booked and we were being transferred to the Timhotel a few blocks over.  When I informed them that I had spoken to the reservations dept the previous day and reconfirmed our reservation, they became hostile and rude, for no reason at all.  They proceeded to inform me that they do not make money through travel bookings such as expedia and if I did not book directly with them, they were under no obligation to honour our reservations.  When I brought it back to them that the new receptionist story was an untruth, they wrote down the name and address of the new hotel and told",1,1
"Booked this hotel via the internet on the hotel's own website. charged 87.60 euros for one night and thought fair enough....it looks like a nice place to stay with my wife for a romantic night in Paris.  Arrived Saturday 2pm to be told they'd had an inexperienced member of staff who'd overbooked and that we were now staying in a ""more expensive"" hotel in the same road - Comfort Hotel. Needless to say our experience was so bad I've posted a sperate review of this other hotel which, incidentally, charges 60 euros per night!!!  Now having read the various comments posted on here PLEASE DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL as you too may never get past Reception. What's more you'll be overcharged in the process!",1,1
"Fortunately we had only prepaid for one night at this hotel through expedia (who have lost my custom for good). The lobby of this hotel is indeed lovely. We were told that whilst they couldn't accommodate us they were sending us to an even better hotel! Indeed the entrance to the grand hotel de normadie does appear nice (presumably to lure those who think they are getting a three star hotel - come on french tourist board stop stuffing your face with croissants and go past the entrance to these places!). This hotel is a ----hole (excuse my french!). The rooms and stairways reminded me of a student squat, and a poorly faciliated one at that (At least my student squat many years ago had a working TV).  Don't go to either of these hotels.",1,1
"My wife and I visited Paris at Easter and having booked the Des Arts in January (through Expedia) thought we would be safe. I have to be honest and say that i hadn't really looked into the hotel with any great detail. It looked nice from the pictures and suited our budget. (besides double booking rarely happens...right?) We were greeted after a long hot walk with our cases with the same 'New receptionist has over booked' speil that seems all too common. The 'Heavy snowfall' excuse i have later read is a classic! We were being moved to the Grande Normandie, a 3 star hotel so we were told, in the Opera district but this was no good to us as we specifically wanted to stay in the MontMarte district.  After much complaining we gave in and waited for our free transport to the hotel,",2,1
"On arriving at this Hotel on the evening of Sunday 20 March with my two travelling companions, we were quickly told by the man at the Reception Desk that our booking was not for this Hotel despite us having full documentation to confirm our booking. No reason was given to us for our booking not being able to be honoured.  I have since read about the practice of ""bumping"" guests taking place at this Hotel on Trip Adviser and feel it should be highlighted to would be guests that my party were subjected to a situation that appears to be fairly commonplace at this establishment.  The Hotel we were sent to, whilst being fairly decent, was situated in Pigale in the heart of Paris' red light district, an area of the city we certainly would not have booked through choice.    I am sure",1,1
"We too as some other people had reserved and payed for a room at this hotel for our last night in Paris. We were supposed to be celebrating my partners newly passed doctorate and my pregnancy. As we were living in a hotel nearby we went to have a look at hotel desArts the day before, I thought it looked sweet and was really happy since we had spent four nights in an avarage hotel and this looked like an upgrade. So as so many others when we arrived we were told that there was a slight problem with their Hotel and that we would be sent to a better one and receive breakfast. Sounded good so we were Ok about it. But what we got at Hotel Grande Normandie, was just awful. It was on a busy street in an awful area. The room was ---!!!!!!!! Much worse then the 2 star hotel we had been",1,1
"This is an awful place. Despite pre-paying, our party were dunted to another hotel. I suspect there is a system in place where a group of hotels advertise through Expedia with one hotel (this one) over book and shift people. This avoids advertising charges for them. When we arrived the guy at reception said that shifting us was OK!, he was obviously used to doing so. This establishment is not trustworthy, avoid at all costs...",1,1
"Over booked again which didn't help after we had suffered flight cancellations, lost luggage.  I had read reviews on this sight about the overbooking situation and actually got Expedia to confirm our booking when our flights were delayed. We were told this was fine. We arrived 5 hours late and were moved to another area of Paris (Batignolles) to the hotel Du Mont Port (this was clean, friendly but not what we booked and certainly a lower grade hotel as it is cheaper to book).  My advise if you don't want a trip to a fantastic city tarnished DO NOT BOOK HOTEL DES ARTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I highly reccomend the Batignolles area and would say hotel Du mon port is ideally situated and cheap and cheerful",1,1
Its simply happening far too often to be anything other than a systematic scam. We had booked for 3 nights through Expedia and on arrival late on the evening of 20 March our party of 3 were advised by the receptionist that there wasn't a room available but that we had been shifted to a better hotel. The receptionist claimed not to have much English and was quite unsympathetic.No explanation was given as to why the prepaid rooms had been relet and we were told to come back the next day and see the manager if we were unhappy! Having read Trip Advisor I had prepared my colleagues for the possibility of the  bumping scam however it doesn't make it any better when it happens to you. We were moved to the Carlton Hotel at Pigalle and whilst the hotel itself was clean and the staff,1,1
"Despite being informed that this hotel had a reputation of ""bumping"" to other hotels we still went ahead and booked - thought we'd covered ourselves by emailing ahead and letting them know we knew this could happen! Well, we got there and the lobby is lovely! Before we even finished saying hello we were told that there was damage to our room by a previous guest (a new excuse apparently - the usual is new member of staff who can't book guests properly and / or computer problems) and that we'd have to go elsewhere. As I am fluent in French I told the manageress that we knew they did this and that we wanted our room no matter what - no joy though in fact she was very dismissive of us.    We were told to go to the Timhotel Montmartre nearby and given a dodgy photocopied map to get",1,1
"I reserved a room several weeks before the arrival.  However, as I got to the hotel, the receptionist told me that parts of the hotel was closed because of the problem due to an unexpected amount of snowfall.   They assigned me another hotel, whose owner is the same as that of the Hotel des Arts.  I suppose that the hotel intentionally accepts the researvation that exceeds their capacity, and gives the customers to the other hotel.  It is a disgusting policy and I do not recommend this hotel to anyone who does not want to be get scammed!",1,1
"I got scammed at this hotel as well. Was told a tissue of lies of how a new receptionist had over - booked by 10 people. Was sent to another hotel, which was the pits. I had booked weeks in advance to stay at the hotel. They are a complete joke.",1,1
"My family and I were also turned away on the first night of a short holiday we had booked in advance and sent to another hotel nearby which was certainly of a lower standard.  We were allowed back for the last 2 nights, but it was clear that the hotel management had overbooked and were sending unsuspecting foreign tourists elsewhere and saving themselves some money.  Apart from that the hotel was comfortable and clean.",2,1
"We were scammed too....We risked booking at the the hotel despite all the warnings.  I phoned the hotel prior to arrival to confirm they had received the booking - which they had, so I felt quite confident we would be ok...big mistake!.  On arrival at the hotel we were told that our room had been flooded.  So, we were bumped to another hotel (the comfort inn, sacre couer) which was ok but quite small.  We paid ??20 a night so we were not too unhappy, but if your heart is set on staying in a really nice hotel, it may be best to avoid this hotel....be warned and good luck!",2,1
"I checked tripadvisor before booking and decided to risk being bumped, as those who actually get to stay seem to like it and the location is great.  Bad move!  Arriving 6 Dec 04 we were spun the same lies about a new receptionist  overbooking.  The Paris boat show (quite a minor event) was said to have caused a hotels crisis too.  Like the others we were dumped outside Montmartre, in a hotel with small rooms in a nondescript area.  ""Upgrade"" it was certainly not! The pattern of the same lies spun to others repeatedly over a long period shows that this a systematic and deliberate overbooking scam, not an accident that just keeps on happening again and again.",1,1
"My husband and I and another couple booked this hotel in Feb. 04 for a special birthday in Sept. 04, via Paris Travel Service. On arrival at the reception we were informed that the unfortunately the 'inexperienced receptionist' had double booked our rooms but not to worry they had kindly arranged for us to stay at an alternative hotel. We were transported after a long wait to another hotel which was not as aesthetically pleasing and was not in as nice an area. We had chosen the Des Arts particularly for its location. After seeing the other hotel I returned to the Des Arts to complain that we hadn't been given a choice and the response of the male receptionist was not very pleasant, especially when I queried why we had to move when we'd been booked so long.We were extremely",1,1
"I made my reservations 2 months prior and got a confirmation from the hotel, to no avail. When I arrived I was told the room had been overbooked and was put in another hotel which was not nearly as nice. I am very disappointed; the hotel looks great but the management is at the least incompetent. I do not accept their explanation that this was an oversight; I think they purposefully overbook and then deliver their guests to other local hotels. Look at how often overbooking occurs.",1,1
"Having read the reviews on tripadvisor.com about this hotel, I decided to book it anyway. It seemed like those people who booked and actually managed to stay in the hotel, were quite satisfied with the hotel. But it seemed like they did have a habit of overbooking the hotel, and shunting people off to other hotels out of the Montmartre neighbourhood. I decided to take the risk! Bad decision.  After a day of driving 3 hours from Liverpool to Luton airport in the UK, then catching a flight to Paris, then an RER train into Paris and then 2 Metro lines to the Moulin Rouge, and then a walk up the hill to the hotel, we were given the bad news. Unfortunately their new or inexperienced (I can't remember which explanation we were given) receptionist had accidentally overbooked the hotel,",2,1
"It is true that this hotel has bad service. Try to book this hotel for a longer stay, and you will feel it ! We booked this hotel at the beginning of September 2004 through a famous travel agent in Tokyo. We booked it for 4 nights, but we only stayed there 2 nights.  The first day we arrived, they bumped us to other hotel, which fortunatelly better than this hotel. We thought that this is a little strange, but we still can accept it.  They told us to come back to Des Arts at the second day, and we stayed there for two nights.  Then at the forth night, the unbelievable thing happened. We still have our luggage being kept at this hotel, but the receptionist said that they don't have any room for us, and bumped us again to another hotel. This time is worse because the hotel was",1,1
"It isn't just on line bookings that get bumped to other hotels.  I booked last September for a trip in July through a reputable travel agent, Thomas Cook.  When we got to the Hotel we were told there were no twin rooms and we had been transferred to another hotel of the same class - at no extra charge (I should think not!).  The other hotel was decent enough, but away from the area I wanted and as I had specifically booked a trip to Montmartre as a Christmas gift for my mother, I was, to say the least, disappointed.  Needless to say I will try another hotel next time.",1,1
"...as they will bump you!Clearly from other posts and my own experience they will quite happily take bookings and money up front and then bump you in favour of tour groups who will pay a higher rate.We arrived just after 1pm to hear that there was a ""petite problem""! An ""inexperienced receptionist"" had mistakenly double booked our room and many other rooms. Yes, part of your consolation is that you are not the only one!! You can argue all you like but they will not budge, we had the kind offer of a refund and the option of trying to find our own hotel on a friday afternoon in Paris rather than take their option at their ""sister hotel""!!My advice...just don't book in the first place!",1,1
"I would strongly caution people from booking this hotel on-line.  After a long flight and the hassle of making our way into Paris from the airport we were informed that the Hotel had made an error in our booking and we were being moved to a hotel outside of Montmartre.  The alternate hotel (The Excelsior) turned out to be fine and to give them their due, they provided us with a driver and got us settled in quickly.  In reading other reviews, we've discovered we were not the first to have our plans altered and we suspect that they often bump on-line reservations for which they are paid less, in favour of walk-in or phone-in guests for whom they get the full rate with no middle-men.  Having travelled a great deal, my wife and I rolled with the punch and had a marvellous time in",1,1
"I had read the earlier reviews on this site and thought that those people had simply been unlucky and that overbooking must be a rare occurence. But having now been shunted elsewhere myself, having booked the hotel for last weekend, I now share the opinion that this is a regular plan. I arrived on friday having spent the day travelling with a young child to be told that a new member of staff had made a mistake and double booked.The hotel had however as with other reviewers, made another booking for me elsewhere and one of their staff was on hand to take me there.What was described as a 5 minute walk away turned out to be 15mins by car.I would not risk booking this hotel again as they obviously do not honour bookings, and you have no say on which part of paris you end up staying",1,1
"I too tried to visit the Hotel Des Arts in April, but never got to stay there.My wife and daughter were with me on a special 2 day Eurostar trip but when we arrived at the Hotel Des Arts, they blithely announced that they were full and had no booking for us.  Subsequent to some very strong representations and my production of booking confirmations from ""Travelnow"" (aka hotels) they admitted that they had been given our bookings but claimed to have declined them.  With gallic shrugs the reception clerk tried to simply dismiss us and put us on the street blaming the ""travel.now"" brigade for everything.  More, and stronger, representations mysteriously produced a map to the Hotel Casino where apparently ""by chance"" there were the last 2 double rooms vacant (but we would have to pay",1,1
"Having read some of the other reviews on this site I felt strongly that I should add my own. I've stayed in this hotel twice. Once about 4 years ago when there were no problems at all. From that visit I can see why it gets some good reviews - it's clean, good value and in a good location. However, the second time I stayed in it (11/03) we fell foul of the 'relocation/overbooking' scam that seems to be operated by this hotel. When we arrived we were informed (in a v matter of fact way) that there had been a problem with the booking and that we had been moved to another hotel of equal standard very nearby. We weren't happy with this but went along with it as we really didn't have a choice. In fact the other hotel was not nearby (especially when you don't know an area) and the room",1,1
"We booked 2 double rooms in this hotel on the internet for the night Saturday 17 April 2004. I received 2 emails confirming the booking. We arrived at 3pm to check in and were told there were no rooms and that the hotel had informed the internet company by fax. We were very quickly offered 'a hotel that they knew very well'. This hotel was completely out of the area we required as we wanted to be within 2 minutes walk of Montmartre restuarant and art area. We had no choice but to accept, as we had no idea where else to go. The internet company claim the hotel did not inform them. When checking in at the Hotel Casino (recommended by Hotel Des Arts) we spoke to another couple who were also sent there by the Hotel Des Arts as there 'was a mistake'. In view of another comment posted",1,1
"We recently returned from a two week trip to Paris (Dec. 25- Jan. 8) and spent the last two nights of our trip at this hotel in Montmartre.  The location is good, particularly if you are a lover of the film, Amelie. You are just two blocks from her workplace, Cafe des deux Moulins on Rue Lepic, and about eight blocks from her corner market.  Also about a 20 minute walk to Sacre Coeur, up hill. Around the corner from this hotel is an excellent Tiebtan food restuarant. The hotel itself was adequate. It had the most extensive breakfast of our hotels with serve yourself set up. The room was dark and smelly (cigarettes and too much perfume to cover it up) and the bed was very soft. I think your budget dollar could best be spent at another hotel. It is probably a fine hotel if you are",2,1
"We booked and paid online, a month in advance, for a two night stay at the Hotel des Arts in Paris. The Hotel des Arts is in a very pretty location and we paid extra for a 'room with a paris view'. The hotel looks beautifully decorated on the internet - but that's as much as we saw...  When we arrived, the receptionist told us a cock and bull story about ""first floor floorboards being up"" and they'd booked us into a comparable hotel, nearby, and as a conciliatory gesture the hotel was 3* (in comparison to Hotel des Arts' 2 stars).  The alternative hotel was the Hotel Bellevue - which is a fairly spartan and economical hotel, and is not in such a nice area (especially after nightfall). Bearing in mind, we had paid to stay in the Hotel des Arts, not getting the Hotel des Arts to",1,1
"I would not have said this until I checked out. The hotel is adequate in most respects, clean, well situated and reasonably priced.  Unfortunately the manger and receptionist are both totally inept and staggeringly arrogant. The receptionist manged to charge my stay twice to my bank whilst telling me the transcation had been refused. Having settled the bill with another card I called my bank who advised me that the hotel had attempted to charge me twice. I attempted to rectify this with both the receptionist and the manager who claimed I was rude, apparently rudeness in his world equals politely asking him to rectify the errors of his incompetent staff. Paris has many fine hotels run by good people, this isn't one of them, don't stay there.",1,1
"Hotel is basic but comfortable as what is expected for a 2* hotel, but the customer service was Appalling! No greeting (never mind ""nice greeting"") was given on our arrival. Although check in was at 12:00pm, they told us our rooms would not be ready till 2:30pm, No aplogy was given for this inconvenience, and for the duration of our stay no information was given to us about breakfast times, maid service, checking out procedures etc etc. So if your looking for a nice friendly enviroment for a romantic getaway (like us) Don't bother with this hotel.",2,1
Make sure if you lose something in the hotel room. Don’t expect to get it back. I left my AirPods Pro in my room. They never contacted me. Where I could have gone back to get them. I emailed them they took a week to get back. Made me pay 50 euros to mail them to me and I still do not have them. Hotel is in a great location. The staff was friendly when I was there. After the fact it has been horrific. I have them ample time to fix the problem and still no resolve.,1,1
"I visited the property after three years since last stay. VIsited 9th - 12th of September.  The hotel is very well located next to Les halles station, with perfect metro connection and next to B line from airport.  We ordered Executive King room. We got room 208. It seems rooms 202, 204, 206... all have openable windows into the dining hall and not to the outside. This might be acceptable if Air conditioning A/C was working. It was not.  It was blowing in air but warm air only.  As the room was quite warm, weaking up sweating we talked to the front desk three times during different shifts. On all occations they were ""goin to look at it"" or ""send somone"".  In none of the occasion we received any feedback.   It became clear to me that the hotel was going to ignore this problem.",2,1
"Okay, lets start with the positives, this hotel is in a very good location, a few steps away from Les Halles Metro station. It has a Nespresso machine in the bedroom and you can request additional pods from reception.   I was travelling with my husband and our 15 year old daughter, we booked a room with two queen beds, thinking there would be additional space, there wasn't! The room was very cramped and there was no usable mirror near a plug  to allow you to style your hair, there was a hairdryer in the very cramped bathroom, this hairdryer (like all hotels) wasn't fit to style my hair and there was nowhere to plug straighteners in etc. The curtains in the room were covered in holes which allowed the sunlight to shine through in the morning (not what i would expect of a 4 star",2,1
"Location is perfect. Rooms are excellent but TV does not function and this was apparently true for many rooms so I could not even move to another room. Breakfast was super small but a manager helped me out. Upon checking out, I asked for the receipt to be send by Email and after 5 days, I still did not receive it. I tried to call but I am put through to a reception that does not respond and I tried to email but no reply. There is a good potential for this hotel to become very good but staff needs to be more coordinated.",2,1
"After 3 nights of waking up drenched in my own sweat and having considered all options (virus, aircon, stress, etc) I finally checked the bed and realised Novotel, a 4 star hotel, uses plastified matrass covers right under the bed sheet. I had it removed and the last night was finally restful. As expected and as always, the reception desk was sincerely sorry about it and made a report. One of this moment when sorry feel as tiring as 3 bad nights sleep. If sleeping on a plastic bag is not a concern then the place is great. You can also request to have it removed. I felt this is not just letting down clients but also the staff who delivers a quality and friendly service.",2,1
"This could be such a good hotel if it would only do something about it's heating system! The room was good, the location fabulous, but we just weren't able to get the room to a comfortable temperature no matter how long we left the air con on for, and the hotel would not provide a plugin heater. Such a shame.",1,1
Arrived tired. The staff couldn't find our reservation. Tried to check our email to verify.  Had trouble connecting to wifi.  After numerous attempts a tech guy was called. Finally got to our room for a rest and a much-needed shower only to find shampoo and body wash containers practically empty. A room service tray was not picked up outside our door. Still there when we checked out.  Final insult: breakfast not included!,2,1
I kid you not - there are mice running around the bar. We are in the bar for a few drinks after dinner and there were mice running around. I love Minnie and Micky but this is a joke - I would go to Disneyland for this kind of virtual reality experience.,1,1
"overall' the hotel is good: good location, stuff are nice and helpful, room looks clean and the bed is good.  The only thing that can ruin the vacation is the fact the they do not   protect their guests!  Out bag pack was but someone inside the hotel lobby and they   didn't order the police to the place and haven't looked at the cameras!  I am still waiting for them to call me!  Be careful with your luggage  there....",1,1
"We have enjoyed many wonderful adventures in Paris and always stayed at the Novotel Les Halles as it is in a wonderful position to explore Paris. Our last trip which was in July 2019 was very disappointing. I always book the Novotel as it was spotlessly clean and I felt at home and relaxed knowing this. Apparently they have changed to contract cleaners and the standard has dropped dramatically. Our shower cubicle and the ceiling was thick with mold, the carpet was covered in stains and the bedhead was so filthy that the management had to pin sheets over it so we could go to bed. Hence I had no sleep that night as I was so upset by the standard of the room. We booked a Junior Suite as we thought it would be better and it looked so good on the internet. There was a trundle bed in",2,1
Accor platinum not recognised; no upgrade; asked for high level room - put on lower floor; best to stay with Hilton or Marriott properties where they reward status better. Platinum status worthless at this hotel,2,1
"Our flight to Paris was unfortunately canceled out of our control the evening we were to fly. We could not get on another flight in a timely manner to use our reservation. Novotel Les Halles refuses to refund us and basically told us tough luck, we are taking your money anyways. We spoke to a number of people including management. One person even told us to email proof that the flight was cancelled and we did, yet they refused to refund us. FYI, We booked through a travel company who was willing to refund us and it was Novotel who said no.  When we do get to Paris, we won’t be staying here.",1,1
"As a frequent travelor, Accor has long been my preffered hotel group.Having stayed in Accor hotels across 7 countries I frequent for work, I would have never thought to check trip advisor reviews before making a booking at the Novotel Les Halles in Paris.However, I really should have. I found out too late the hotel has has several reviews related to odd charges to rooms and credit cards over the last 2 years.On trying to use the minibar after a 30 hour journey from Australia I found it locked - which was odd, as I had to hand over my company credit card on arrival.I went to an empty lobby late on my first night, and was told by the receptionist that I needed to add a card to my room to unlock the mini bar. I told him I had given the hotel my company amex on arrival and he told",1,1
"There were many things that went wrong during our stay. The check-in experience was poor, the room did not have the amenities that were listed during booking, the restaurant is over-priced with inattentive service and mediocre food... I gave this hotel several opportunities to make things right but they just don't care enough about their guests. I guess they have so much business that losing some customers just doesn't matter.",1,1
"Hotel was very nice but room and service was lacking.  The only good party was the easy check in - We checked in very late because our flight was delayed, they immediately had our room ready at 3:00 am.    Problems with the AC and Plumbing.  It was very hot June in Paris, the air condition would not work, we asked front desk twice to inspect and repair but nobody ever showed up to fix the problem.  Toilet would not stop running the first night and  had to have it repaired in the middle of the night.      On our last day the hallway just outside our room near the elevator stunk with Marijuana smell.  It was strong and horrible.   When I reported to the reception, she denied it and said it was paint which is worse considering they are putting us on a floor with hazardous paint",2,1
"The Hotel was an utter disappointment. The lobby is grand. But the rooms are small, cramped and like a hostel. There was no place to move. There is no decor in the room. It is very very basic. The rooms were not kept clean. The bathroom is so small, that even one person finds it a struggle to use it.  Overall I would not recommend this hotel for a family with children. We expected more from Novotel and were disappointed.  The only positive is the location of the hotel. It is in the city centre and is easy to access the sightseeing spots. But I am sure there are better options for the same price in the vicinity.",2,1
"I like the hotel overall, but we could not open the window which is a complete No go for us.   Our window faced and internal hall so even if it could have been opened IT would still be Better than this prison. I'm writing this from the room and feeling like bring choked.  I do not normally have issues with small rooms or closed rooms but this is Strange.  In the Bright side the hotel is situated in a very central (not equivalent to Posh) area. Many Street vendors screaming ""one euro one euro one euro"" may make some sende of the fact that the Windows cant open.  IT is like bring on a bad Ferry.  👍",1,1
"This is my first time posting negative review in TA we tried to forget but that horrible experience is very hard to forget.  We are family of 3 visiting Paris the first time. I chose Novotel Paris Les Halles because i am an accor member and we read many good reviews.     We came for check-in and as usual i gave 3 passport and also print-out of hotel voucher to reception, but this gentlemen name Samir from the beginning seems to be very confuse with my reservation, he just kept on typing his computer & asked me three htimes if I have checked-in before, I said no, then he also asked for my son age several times (same question). I notice that his movement are repetitive and unsteadiness on his feet. He later said something about the printer which at the end my check in process took",1,1
I was stay a hotel room number 430 and my freinds 432 in 15.11.2017 just 1 night we need stay 3 night but we just stay 6 hour because the reception crew has name Matthien and guy they kidding with me they was gived already room to late and gived just 1 room we was take the other room in the night a 12 pm but was very hurt to take room about matthien and guy they ask me the name from room the room was for 2 person number 432 the second person didn't come with us when we arrived first time in hotel I was explain to them and they said they change the name no problem but in the night matthien and guy they really kidding with me we was wait 45 minute they say only tell me correct name I was explain to them what's happened but they didn't understand anything and guy he want to teach,1,1
"The room was fine, the staff were excellent, but the hotel is in an area prone to pickpockets.  Sadly I learned this the hard way.  A group of men were aggressively soliciting a cause in French, a language I do not speak, and continued even when I asked them to stop.  Later I learned my money had been stolen.  Their aggressiveness should have been a warning.  BE ALERT, BE AWARE!",1,1
"I was disappointed to find our room in such a dirty and old condition. Filthy carpets, filthy walls and doors, bathroom etc.  Our room was a standard room - looks nothing like the pictures.  We were on level 1 which was quiet but it seems the hotel put a lot of families on that level which would explain the filthy condition of the room. There is still construction out the front of the hotel but that didn't bother us on this visit.  The thing this hotel has going for it is it's location and staff.  The staff are amazingly friendly and helpful - I'd like to make a special mention to Anna who was extremely helpful - merci.  Reception seems busy most of the time so be prepared for a wait when you check in & out.  For the price we paid, I would've expected a clean room.... even in",2,1
"This hotel is very well positioned in center of (touristic) Paris and therefor a great starting point for visits. However our arrival was not a happy one : we booked an executive room (!) which was not ready at our arrival at 14:30. They sent us to another room, which wasn't cleaned very well (the toilet was awfull) and beds were not ready. It seems staff is not able to manage its facilities and cope with a lot of people in the hotel. This was a very disappointing experience with the Accor group and Novotel hotels... For me not a warm welcome, and a serious disappointment.",2,1
"It was like the Paris of old when the only words Parisians could say in English were ""No"" or ""it's impossible"". Indeed the front desk staff at Novotel Les Halles were obviously trained in the old school.   Our group's country manager had booked us all into the Novotel Les Halles for a business ""customer intimate"" weekend around the classic horse race the Prix de l'Arc de Triomph.  The hotel was expensive, the rooms were small and just functional, designed in every way to be easily cleaned and robust to reduce ware and tear at the cost of comfort!   The breakfast was continental in typical french minimalist style!  Be sure to book a taxi 5 days in advance and whatever you do don't ask for directions- as they are not forthcoming.   But all this would have been just about tolerable",1,1
"Booked this late because of business commitments meaning I could not plan ahead - but also because I am regular user of Accor as the standards are usually consistent, i.e. No surprises but you get what is advertised. However (so far, trip not over) this has been disappointing. Tripadvisor alerted us to works in the area - not the hotel. Actually the taxi could not get to the hotel due to the works (we maybe could have used metro but were concerned about dragging suitcases a distance after a previous trip was spoilt by pick pockets). Tonight the video on demand failed - worse it kept saying ""try in a few minutes"" but after 45 minutes and complaints the staff eventually had to give up and admit the third party provider would only fix ""tomorrow"". Dont know if that is the real story",2,1
"This hotel is completely miss leading, with non helpful staff. First of all, they charged me for a room because I pre-paid but left a day early. No one would even help or make the situation even better. Also, no ONE ever disclosed to us when booking over 6 months ago or even when we were checking in that the entire area around the hotel is under construction, right by the front door, the taxis can't even get you to the door or near it. There was also mold in our room. My husband were here on our honeymoon, and we couldn't wait to get out of this hotel. We then accidentally left 4 shirts in the closet and we called within an hour of leaving the hotel to head to our train. They actually charged me $40 to send me my 4 shirts! After not refunding me for the night we did NOT spend",1,1
Just checked in. Room nice enough but construction on second floor all this week until six pm is the word from front desk. Just FYI if can change your plans.  Bit loud in our room on second floor and wish did not prepay,2,1
stayed here at novotel for 3 days but the stay seemed like forever. Im sorry but it was not what i expected it to be. The pictures on their website is quite decieving. We got the opposite of the room we wanted. when we got to the room the sofa bed was made up... I called and asked if it could be made back up as a sofa sonwe could have more space in the room but until we check out our request was never done. Theres a mall outside the hotel but part of it was under construction so it did not look nice. The only positive thing probably is theres a lot of restaurants around the area. I didnt get a good first impression of PARIS so i promise i will come back and give paris another chance but i will never stay in this hotel again 🙁,2,1
"Really disappointed and terrible experience. We were allocated standard room 138 with 4 bed configuration. Water kettle lid was broken, my wife got burnt due to that luckily no major injures but still burning and pain. Hotel didn't even bother to apologise for that. They offered to call the doctor (advised cost will be 18-20 euros)and didn't even reimburse with a execute as it is late and manager will have to look into this.  Doctor costed us 130 euro when we were told 18-20 euro from Audrey (staff member responsible at that time). First advised that manager will not be available on the weekend and all kind of excuses as we can't reimburse. The hotel staff member had smug smile on his face when we asked for reimbursement. It was so annoying as wife was still in pain and he said",1,1
"The receptionists are incredibly polite by European standard. The lady who serve me is very polite. Her English can be better, I believe she is trying her best but there is small thing where she said ""Everything in the mini bar is free except alcoholic drink and meat""  I don't see any meat in the bar but nut, so I thought the nut is free. It's not! When I check out, they almost charge me for the nut. Luckily she let me go without the need to pay the nut but it gives unpleasant taste in the end :( In the outside there are people building the metro station I think, the isolation from outside is good enough where you will barely hear it if you turn on TV in the room. To my surprise, there is also renovation inside the hotel! My baby awaken on her morning sleep thanks to people who",2,1
"We just checked in to this hotel and we were very happy with how beautiful and comfortable the hotel lobby was. As we walked into our room, we're very disappointed. This hotel has a 4 star rating but it's really a 3 star.   - carpets were dirty  - bathroom/shower room was dirty and old  - when we took showers, the whole bathroom was completely wet from the steam.  - This part is the worst. When we removed our sofa bed cushions to set up our bed, the bottom of the mattress had a huge dirt stain. This is something your guest will see right when they remove the cushions, at least wrap it up with sheets?  Overall very disappointed with this hotel. Hallways and all looked very nice but rooms are completely a different thing.  We really considered checking out after tonight and go to",2,1
"Great locaton but staff needs some lessons in customer service. Reception wanted to overcharge and after arguing extensively for a good 45min. realised mistake, failed to apologise and this with a Gold Accor customer. Do not want to know how non-loyalty programme customers are treated. Todays experience was a direct invitation for me to move on from Accor. Hint: there are good alternatives close by ;)",1,1
"Handily placed and decent enough building but various issues spoiled our experience. Check in was a messy affair with rooms not available well after 3pm, notwithstanding the fact we had received texts confirming that our keys were ready for collection. Check out was similarly poor when the hotel confused which of our two rooms we were checking out of and which we were staying in for a further night, as originally booked. Reception staff were very smiley about it all but unable to correct the error, so we had to then go and move our stuff from one room to another unnecessarily. Then the keys didn't work and, finally, no hot water for a shower at 6pm in the evening, which is  bit rubbish for a big modern hotel. Staff kept dropping into ""is everything ok for you mode"" when we were",2,1
"I checked out of the Ibis Republique for what i thought would be an upgrade . Kaplop ... I made a mistake . My room cost 3 times that of Ibis ...I should have stayed where I was .The room and much of the hotel interior is gloomy... the only bright spot is the elevator. lol Not worth the price I paid ...next time back to the Ibis which was cheap, clean, more modern and friendlier ...",2,1
"I booked a room online. Upon check-in, they charged me a refundable 150 euro deposit. However, they never refunded me the 150 euros. My assistant and I called SIX times, each time saying they would refund the money. It never happened. We also emailed them several times.",1,1
"I have booked room with cruises on the seine. However they didn't give me any cruise ticket. This is fraud.  Some lady said on the phone that it was my fault because i didn't ask for ticket . (This is insane.)And she said  bluntly she is gonna check what they can do. All I wanted was sincere apology from them.When I checked out hotel, they didn't  apology and they didn't explain further details.",1,1
"Firstly I'd like to start on a positive note, the hotel is very central, clean and a brilliant place to stay in Paris. I didn't have any complaints until I came home and had three fraudulent transactions on my credit card.  My bank were brilliant and sorted it out, however the hotel were very poor in handling my initial phone calls and did not answer 3 of my emails.   I only got an apology from the hotel a month after my bank had refunded me and investigated the £1000 that had been taken from my credit card.  This has completely ruined my memories from staying in this otherwise great hotel.",1,1
"Friendly staff, good service, but a construction zone, building all around hotel.  Noise from construction  all day, then the area is near train station and people coming off train can be heard all hours.  Poor sound insulation  in rooms.  Restaurant was not much.  Finallt, do not trust estimated time for taxi arrival.",2,1
"Stayed there over the weekend and as I came back to Paris two days later I asked if I can leave my suitcase with them. The receptionist was nice enough and asked the manager who approved it. Monday morning when I came back the receptionist on that day was a totally different story. The immediate response was NO! we don't do these things. When I insisted that she will check as her colleague left the details she didn't find anything about it. Her manager was even worse, after 15-20 minutes of back and forth without talking to me (only French between them) she came to me, saying she will do it although it's highly unacceptable. She mentioned that at least five times more, giving me the feeling I'm doing something more. I told her, if I had known it's like that I wouldn't have come,",1,1
"My first night, I checked in efficiently, and I ate at the hotel restaurant with colleagues. The portion size was small, and the wine was mediocre. This unfortunately was not the worst part. The worst part was that I ordered a chocolate lava cake and it came with the center still frozen. I was deeply insulted and my colleagues and I had to send it back. It is one thing to serve food that is not fresh, it is quite another to serve still-frozen food. When I went to my room, it was clean, and modern (possible the only redeeming part of my stay). That night, I slept poorly unfortunately. The pillows were very low quality, and there were not different types of pillows for different preferences.  In the morning I requested different (softer) pillows to be sent up at the front desk.",1,1
So it's April and hot and stuffy but am told air conditioning only kicks in next month. Open the window and its noisy as hell.  Ask for an iron and you are told there is a room for that- ask for laundry service you are told Ho to the room.  Simply awful experience -Two nights and zero nights of sleep -as said -never again,1,1
"My 14 yr old sister and I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and it wasn't great.  At half past midnight on the first night I rang reception because it was extremely warm in the room, and we had the window open.  I asked reception for a fan to which he replied they don't provide them, and at the moment there's only warm air blowing through the air conditioning system.  He offered to move us to another room so we could open the window, but we already had a full length door to open.  Having to have the door open also meant that we were constantly disturbed throughout the night from the near by bars etc., and then early in the morning when the construction work started again.  There are huge excavating works taking place in front of the hotel which were extremely noisy, as well as",2,1
"Having stayed at the sister hotel Ibis Blackfriars in London. I was expecting good service. Good breakfast and working amenities. Up to the standard of, if not better then said sister hotel. We found out that the air conditioning is not gassed with cold air during the winter months and the temperature is set at 27 degrees Celsius all through the hotel. This means you are dripping with sweat when you are in your room. I was placed in the unrenovated section in room 134. The night manager was able to move us to a room where the window was able to be opened and air let in. That room is 407. Whilst having breakfast, the food had been left in the same trays from the start of the morning. 6 til 10. The food sits in its own fat and is not replaced. When asked for a lactose free option",2,1
"We stayed 2 nights before the dramatic events in Paris. We booked online and asked for confirmation of availability of glutenfree breakfast for my husband.  NO reaction at all, when I called day before departure, they said, of course, no need to worry.  Indeed, at the buffet there's a special glutenfree corner, available to everyone.  This was problem the second day, because when we came down for breakfast this corner was empty.  After asking, staff did not really react, we asked about 5 times to finally hear nothing was available, no more food for my husband? Unacceptable, so finally someone went to the shop to get something, so we waited for more than one hour! At checking out, full breakfast was put on the bill, when we mentionned this to the lady, again we waited for over",2,1
Beyond upset at this hotel for not refunding our stay that we had to cancel due to the terrorist events. We have dreamed and saved for this trip forever. Due to our concern for our families safety and not wanting to spend Christmas and New Years in fear of when the next arrack was gonna happen we canceled our whole trip. Our hearts go out to Paris and these horrible events but shame on this hotel for not bending on their policies because this is out of our control. I'm sure they will receive insurance for the lost of business and still pocket our money. Sadly disappointed! When we do make it to Europe if all this dies down and make our stop in Paris I will not book at this hotel. Shame shame shame!!!!!,1,1
"I'm currently staying at the Novotel Les Halles, hotel location is excellent, rooms are standard Novotel interiors.  The service is the worst I have experienced with Accor!  I arrived at 7am and the lady told us the room is ready however, to check you in you need to pay Euros 70! What's the point of being gold Accor member of you don't offer early check in (since the room is ready). Told here thanks and we checked in @ 12.  While booking the room I have specifically mentioned the AC need to be ON! The moment I stepped into the room it was like an oven! I turned on the AC and it was not cooling! Open the window and since 3 hours the temperature hasn't changed! Went to the reception to report this and after waiting 15 minutes (again; despite being gold member) the receptionist",2,1
"The location is very central, you have everything at reach. Excellent train connection to the airport.  As a business hotel it would be ok, but... The rooms are very dirty, as the bathrooms. You don't feel like walking on that carpet. The breakfast is not really attractive, quite poor buffet and half of the coffee machines don't work. Not worth that price.",2,1
"the hotel is located in a dangerous part of the city, when you come out the are gates and bords leading to the hotel on a dark alley with drug addicts sitting and laying on the floor. the rooms are small and the beds not comfortable, very hard matrasses and folding sofa beds that feel like laying on a metal spring, very painful",1,1
"Our family of 4 (2 adults, 9yr old and 7 yr old) stayed here for 2 nights in a standard room. We had booked months in advance and had put in a request for a room on a higher floor away from the construction if possible. Upon checking in we asked about our request and were told our room was on the far side away from the construction at the front. What they didn't mention is that our room was facing the more instrusive construction at the back so we were looking face to face with builders if we opened our curtains! The room itself was very tired- dirty carpets and mould on the shower walls and under the basin and old fixtures and furniture. After walking into the nice modern and inviting foyer and restaurant area, entering our room was like walking into a different hotel! When",2,1
"Poor customer service - even though we requested early check as our flight (like all from Canada) arrived early in the morning and we have two little kids, the staff didn't care to help us or expedite the check-in or clean-up. They made us wait till 2pm (as per their policy) for check-in. When we finally got the room, it was full of mold and smelled like dirty socks. We expected a lot more given the rating/reviews.",2,1
"We were very disappointed to see that after a tiring day of traveling The area was under heavy construction. So as we went to check in, we were treated very rude. One of the staff, Mimie, was especially rude and didn't take enough time to tell us a good dining option, and we ended up having to find somewhere to eat by ourselves. Our long time friends who have traveled to Paris with us were very disappointed to see that the Novotel provided them with a 1 king bed and 1 sofa, even though they paid for a 2 queen bed, as 1 king bed and 1 sofa cannot accommodate 4 people, 3 of which are over 18. The next couple of days were very intense-touring the city, than coming to the novotel. The Novotel is in a neighborhood called Les Halles-which is full of gangs and thugs. Over all, we were",1,1
Just had the best meal we have ever had at the restaurant La Place at Novotel Les Halles.  The service of Nickolas was sensational.  Thank you so much. The rooms are nice and staff are friendly but that restaurant was just perfect.,1,1
"Whilst this hotel is in an excellent location we experienced the rudest member of staff I have ever encountered anywhere. We had a nightcap in the bar one of the drinks  we ordered (which is on the menu) was a Bellini. However we were presented with a Bucks Fizz. We sent it back as it WAS NOT a Bellini the BAR MANAGER then added some peach flavouring which was still not satisfactory. The waitress then offered us something else in stead. When the bill came the Bellini was included we objected to this and at this stage the bar manager informed us that she couldn't do anything with it and was insistent that we should pay for it. At this stage my daughter went to find the hotel general manager, the bar manager then proceeded to make loud rude comments about us to other clients at",1,1
"Let's start with the positives:  1) Great location, restaurants and metro stop a block away  2) Lobby was well appointed, very chic, 3) Breakfast buffet was fantastic.   Now for the drawbacks:  1) dirty room, stained carpet, walls were damage, bathroom smelled like an outhouse.  2) difficult to find due to massive construction in the surrounding area including in front of the hotel.  If you are taking a taxi or UBER to this hotel give them this address as it is the closest a car can get to the hotel:  35 Rue Saint-Honore'.  3) Maid service was slow and acted ""put out"" when you ask for anything.  When I complained about the poor condition of the room, I was told that the room I had just hadn't be renovated yet and nothing else was available.  That's what you get when pre-pay for",2,1
Great location but terrible service. The room was not made up till mid afternoon and then only after several requests. Mugs etc were not replaced and each request was carried out ungraciously after several repeats and much incompetence and delay...plus a certain amount of attitude. Not a bargain so let's hope they can improve their act. Am not tempted to stay here again....though we have been repeat customers for years.,2,1
"Superior Room with Double Bed and Sofa. Although the curtains are blackout, there's a design flaw in the room: a glass wall separating bedroom and bathroom means that anyone using the bathroom or toilet shines a lot of light onto the sleeping partner. All bathroom noises also very loud. Aircon pumping out heat. Avoid.",2,1
"OK, so I admit I've been here less than 24 hours, but I have nothing but bad service since check in.  The first sign of trouble was at the restaurant, not including the horrible service (go ahead and try to get a menu or any assistance from the staff, I dare you): my nieces ordered from the child menu where you select one item from each of four areas. When they tried to order their dessert selection, they were told no by the waiter, no ... not yet.  They finished their meals and attempted to order their dessert, but a different waiter told them no, they had already ordered!  They were handed some unknown ice cream and cone thing and the waiter left.

They would not let us stay for the remaining 2 days that we had already paid for claiming we would qualify as ""no show"" and would not refund any of our money. Even though we called and notified them hours before we were supposed to check in. Make sure if you book with them that absolutely nothing goes wrong otherwise you get royally screwed.",1,1
"I went to the hotel to stay for my Honeymoon.  On arrival I was very tired and disappointed to see the construction works.  After seeing some of the many responses about the construction I feel the hotel has not exercised their dur diligence by advising customers of construction works.  When I contact the hotel after to share my disapointment and to advise them that they would be doing their future customers a favour by letting them know about the construction, they advised me ""that by doing some kind of gesture for us would be admitting guilt"".  It goes to show the mentality of the staff and the hotel management that truly they do not care and usually in hospitality it is their job to make your stay as pleasant as possible regardless.  I was unfortunate only to see tripadvisor",1,1
"This is my first and last time ever staying at Novotel Paris Les Halles. I spent a total of 3 sleepless nights here, and quite frankly it was the longest three nights of my life. I have never seen such a run-down room or experienced such disappointing service at any hotel, and wouldn't wish such a ""vacation"" on my worst enemy.  The trip started to go downhill right as I arrived to the hotel with my car, as there was no parking for Novotel guests as there is construction surrounding the hotel, I couldn't even drive up to the hotel to drop off my luggage. When we checked in, we asked the reception staff where we would be able to park our car as parking is something we requested when we made our booking. The parking garage they are partners with (Q Park) was a fifteen minute walk",1,1
"It could be a really great hotel with its excellent location and nice clean rooms but unfortunately our overall experience was very poor due to terrible quality of sleep. Every single morning during our 3 night stay we were woken up by building/refurbishment work just above our room. This is way too early on a romantic break to celebrate 30th birthday! Even a major construction work at Les Halles station just outside the hotel wasnt at all a problem compared to this noise in our bedroom that early in the morning. It felt like there was someone in your bedroom ripping off tiles from the wall right next to your bed using a hammer (and starts drilling plasterboard from about 8am)! Although we expressed our concerns to the reception staff this repeated every single morning, even on",2,1
"I feel so very disapointed at the response of the hotel to the theft of property from our room. We have been given the complete run around and not helped at all. In the most recent exchange with a very young duty manager he concluded that he trusted his staff, even though the item had gone missing and noone by ourselves and his staff had access to the room. NOT what I expected from such a big hotel chain. If you are contemplating staying at this hotel, be sure to keep everything in the safe. I realise these things do happen, however the way that the situation has been handled has totally turned me off of Novotel.",1,1
"Stayed here for 3 nights, never again.  During check-in, staff at the reception took my passport to confirm my identity and then didn't return it. I had to panic run down to reception in order to reclaim it as they'd forgotten to return it. Wasn't even offered a simple apology.  Staff wanted a 150 euro deposit on check in, have never had to do this before, surely my bank acc details are enough? I explained my reservations with this, only for staff to find it funny and chuckle at my concerns. Staff explained, in a cryptic manner, that ""every restaurant has its own dishes"" i.e. no two Novotel hotels are the same - very helpful.  We slept in so missed the afternoon room cleaning, reception confirmed they'd send someone up to clean the room in 5 minutes. An hour later no sign of a",1,1
"Cramped, dirty carpets, moldy shower, dimly lit, slow and unresponsive TV (purchased movie but wouldn't play), dark hallways, foam bed instead of mattress, worn hotel in need of renovation. Nasty all around. On a positive note, staff was generally friendly and helpful (except trying to get the movie to play). Much better places out there for $300/night.",1,1
We were awoken 2 days in a row by fire alarms - and given conflicting explanations for why they happened. Staff did not manage the situation well at all. We had several pieces of clothing stolen from our room. Very bad experience.,2,1
"Simply, the Novotel Paris Les Halles is a centrally positioned hotel that is convenient to all of Paris including Disney.  The location provides direct access to the RER which takes you direct to Disneyland in 30 minutes; the metro is also right on the doorstep which provides quick travel to every other part of Paris; and the hotel is a short walk from Notre Dame and the Louvre.  The refurbishment of the rooms has been well done and the convenience of having a sofa/bed in every room and many rooms having an interconnecting door allows for a simple and easy stay for families.  We were lucky enough to stay there during a Family promo where kids ate free and the second room was 50%.  The room furnishings are all well done and provide everything you need to enjoy your stay.

This has been said the room (supposedly renovated) looked like a psychiatric institute, denuded of any decoration, just white plain walls, a tiny window and a moldy bathroom.  I guess that we were undesirable guest (children?? Points we used to pay) but I notice that the room next door was not looking the same that we wee assigned, it looked like the advertise it on internet.  I notice it to front desk but the lady assured me all room were renovated even mine.  The room was clean but they forgot the vacuum the carpet even if I a aked twice to ask to do it.  Personal in general is super nice and friendly really",2,1

This is the first time I regret my decision to book with Accor.  I booked 3 nights with my family at the Novotel Paris Les Halles this last July 2014.  The service was regrettably poor and unfriendly and the quality of the food was not up to standard.  We went down to have dinner on our first night and found no one to seat us, so we proceeded to ""look"" for a table in the empty restaurant, only to be confronted moments later by an impatient and agitated Maitre D' who appeared quite upset that his guests had not waited for his arrival.  He entered into an argument with my wife and pointed to",2,1

"Despite my rating, I have many positive things to say about this hotel.  The hotel is in a good location very close to a Metro and RER station.  The rooms were large (especially by European standards), seemed newly renovated, and were clean and comfortable.  The showers were nice rain showers and there were nice amenities in the bathroom.  The staff was incredibly kind and helpful.  The negative to this hotel is the noise….and I am not referencing the construction noise (although we did hear this as well).  This hotel is in an area where many young people are out at night and they are extremely loud.  We were literally awakened at all hours of the night hearing street noises.

However, the hotel itself is terrible. The lobby and bar look absolutely great and problably were remodelled a short while ago. But the rooms were old and small and certainly not what you'd expect from a hotel like this. In dire need of renovations!

Firstly we were put in a smokers room, when specifically requesting a non-smoking room. The hotels response... sorry we have no other availability, try tomorrow. The following day we were moved to another room, thankfully non-smoking. However,  the room had no airconditioning working or a window that opens.  What was the hotels solution? Move us to another room exactly the same. Currently the temperature in this room is above 25 degrees Celsius and I cannot physically sleep. Right now, it would be more comfortable laying on dog poo in the streets of Paris. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE UMBRELLA",1,1

When we arrived, we were placed in a smoking room. When I asked to move, I was told the hotel was full and if I wanted fresh air I should ""open the windows."" Incredible. The hotel staff never made any gesture to even acknowledge the issue.  The rooms were basic and the bed was pretty awful.   I recommend staying at either the Citadines next door which we visited, is totally non smoking and looks very nice or the Best Western which is close by.",1,1

This is a mid market chain and it delivers well sized rooms, decent staff, a decent breakfast, clean rooms and a good reception area and bar area.  It doesn't stop there though as it delivers many more things too! This included insipid white rooms, cheap light fittings! construction going on just outside the front door, noisy workmen from 7am, a slightly seedy surrounding area with several beggars on view, a feeling that the hotel is a ll about making money for its owners, slow download speeds for the free wifi, (you could pay for faster but I always liken that to charging for air), bottled water in the minibar for €5.50 per small bottle and many more star features.  My recommendation- stay",2,1
"Location is very good most people says, but it's all. I can use no lift, can use escalaor from platform to hotel with only 1 route, way out to pompidou centre. I had suffered from very bad drain of washstand and bath, all time stayed. At all time of shower, I should wait feeling cold until all sewage were drained to wash my contaminated foot by pooled sewage. Only drain of washstand was unblocked after first complain, room was changed after 2nd complain at 3rd day. But room condition of changed room made me very absurd, both washstand and bath drain were worse than old room. And I called slipper was absent in new room, but it was not delivered during 2 hours with 3 more call. I can't believe even now that hotel condition and service of hotel of such major brand can be such that.",1,1
Was not satisfactory. Expected more. No help with luggage when arrive. Room was poorly equipped.  Huge gap between carpet and bathroom door exposing underlying sharp wooden floor.  Mattress of queen bed was not comfortable as well as sofa bed. Aircon too warm,1,1
"The first thing you need to know about this hotel is despite the improved privileges Accor now offer to their gold members Les Halle's are not complying.  The smirking staff at the desk get great pleasure in saying the computer says no!, initially one would believe this is purely a training issue, but on closer observation it is clear that these rules are higher management driven. The result is it places their staff under a lot of pressure and makes their most loyal customers  write negative reviews. My punishment for asking for my privileges was a room that stunk of cigarette smoke. On refusing, because my reservation was a non-smoking room I was given another room directly over the lobby.  This was a bad move, because at 1.00am a number of women were fighting outside and one",1,1
We had pre booked our accomodation on the Novotel website six months in advance and pre purchased a Executive room I even emailed the Manager a week before who ensured me that it was booked upon arrival we were told we had not had this room allocated and it would be sorted the very next day.  Once we packed all of our belongings for our room change which we had pre paid for on our return from our adventures in Paris we were told there was no Executive room available.  Very dissapointed,1,1
A disappointing hotel.  On arrival we were allocated a lower grade room than we had booked and paid for.  After complaining I was given the room I had paid for however there is major building work going on just outside and we were woken every morning at 6am prompt to the drilling noises outside.  The toilet in the room smelt like a public facility and was not pleasant.  The rooms are small and not really adequate if you are staying as a family for more than one night.  I am sure there will be nicer places to stay in Paris.,2,1
"I stayed several times in this hotel between July and October 2013 for about 10 nights in total. The experienced got worst and worst. During my first stay I was upgraded to a junior suit as  loyal Accor customer and I have to admit the design was great, the bed comfy and the experience pleasant enough. It encouraged me to return to this specific hotel and since then I was all the time more and more disappointed by the room and staff behaviour especially at the front desk. During my last stay (end Oct '13) I even did not stay for the full planned duration, left after the first night and booked another hotel room elsewhere in Paris.  The room has not be upgraded and would have deserved at last some painting. The desk was damaged and never repaired, the lighting in the bathroom",2,1
"Hot... Very hot.  After a few calls to the front desk to have the air conditioning fixed ones then told ""oh it's not tuned on in the hotel right now"".  So yes there is Internet that is included in the room, just at 0.5 mps download speed. Of you would like to do anything more than check your email (video chat)  it will cost an additional €12 /day.  The AC and Internet are perks I tried to look at when considering a family vacation hotel, just should have looked and maybe called ahead.  The staff are pleasant and hotel is generally pretty clean.",2,1
"We ( family of 4, kids 5 and 9 year old) had booked this hotel for 7 nights via accorhotels.com . The room booked was exicutive room (booked one month in advance and paid in full) but 2 days before reaching I was notified that the room is not available due to technical reason and a supirior room was given. Room provided was tiny and had leaking sink and mould in bathroom. A/c was not properly funtioning. On repeatedly asking technical reason for downgrading the room no answer was given and was told that manager will speak with me in person which never happened in 7 days. This was my fifth hotel stay with novotel group accross the globe and I must say standard of service was poor.",1,1
"I was recently in this hotel with my family and I did not nominate anyone. The room we stayed in was very tight (had no closet for our clothes) and the beds were bad. However, the most important detail was that my wife got fleas on the second day. The mattress was torn and dirty. It was easier to change the mattress than in the change room. I felt really bad will on the part of the attendants. The location is bad and has a piece in the front that starts at 06:00. Novotel never!!",2,1
"This hotel has now taken the number one spot in our list of worst hotels we've stayed in, and we travel many times a year and stay in many hotels all over the world. We try to stick to the Accor group where it suits, however this hotel should be swiftly ejected from that group.   The hotel building itself is ok, we stayed in a top floor loft room, however there is no room which gets you away from the large scale construction going on all sides of the building.  Extremely noisy everywhere on every side, with another year to go before it's finished.   The location itself is not too bad, however the immediate vicinity is very 'multicultural' and a little rough at night. Anytime you want to go out, you need to walk 6 blocks away at least to get to a nice area or wait for a taxi.",2,1
"Great location if your a builder. This hotel is completely surrounded by construction sites. The rooms are nice, but stuffy. No air conditioning. Cannot leave the windows open unless your happy listening to jack hammers. Access to shops and restaurants is good. Close to attractions. We were not told about any construction work when we made our booking. While we cannot hold the hotel responsible for this, it didn't gives a very good impression for our first visit to Paris. Decor in rooms looks very IKEA style.",2,1
"Recently stayed 3 nights. While the hotel is situated within walking distance of Notre Dame, Louvre, etc., it is in a very busy neighborhood with construction adjacent to the hotel. The problem arose from a lack of air conditioning in the hotel. We were instructed to open our window. Unfortunately, there was a constant stream of foot traffic extending through the late evening into the early morning from nearby restaurants and bars. And I mean traffic ALL NIGHT. Twice awoken to knock-down, drag-out arguments between inebriated couples. Then, when all that stopped, construction would start in the early A.M.   Otherwise, the hotel was fantastic. The staff was good, accommodations and price reasonable, particularly for such an excellent location in Paris. Would be a good option-",2,1
"Construction front and back, work started 7am! Service vehicles loading/unloading 2am. Car park closed nearest 10 min walk. Access to hotel through building site. No mention when booking of disruption",1,1
"We moved out after one night.  - Jack hammers from the nearby Les Halles construction site start at 7am - Hotel is attempting to fill rooms through Hotwire deals - Staff was anything BUT accommodating   From a misunderstanding around airport transportation to the lack of notice on the construction noise, we could not get one of the 3 staff members we had been in contact with to issue as much as an apology.  It was my partner's birthday and we spent it negotiating with the hotel staff to be relocated to a side of the hotel with less construction noise. The less than accommodating attitude finally prompted us to move out.",1,1
"I have stayed at many Accor properties, this was by far the worst.  The hotel smelled like an old taxicab complete with body odor, cigarettes and spoiled milk.  Mold in our bathroom, shower and water closet. AC was out of service for our entire five day stay   Massive construction outside - five large cranes pounding and hammering 24 hours a day.  I am not exaggerating the slightest bit.  Please see pictures - I wish you could smell the pictures. Our shower leaked so much it overflowed on the carpet. Our bed sheets smelled like smoke and looked like they smelled. We requested additional towels and they never were delivered. The hallways smelled truly bad not just once but for our entire prepaid stay...  The best part of the hotel is a nice buffet breakfast.",1,1
"We arrived to hotel very late after 11pm with many luggages and  carrying kids who are asleep.  At the entrance, it was locked for security reason.  We alerted the receptionist waving to them and pressing the door bell.  We waited for 5 mins.  The receptioniosts continue to chat with their colleagues, door were not opened.  Finally, somebody walk out from inside the hotel, the door was opened.  Definitely the door was not opened by the hotel staff.  I was obviously very angry and asked the receptionist why she didn't open the door.  She answered to me twice, ""it was my colleague who is responsible to open the door, not me""...., I was furious as I don't think it was appropriate to answer this way.  She didn't even apologise.  It was after i asked her to apologise that she did so.",2,1
"It was difficult to get close to the hotel because of the building work, so multiple trips needed to be made to collect luggage.  The check in was beyond slow and with a guest questioning the backpack we had our sleeping child in added to the frustration.  Compared to the Novetel at Tour Eiffel we had stayed in 4 days earlier this hotel was very average.  Thankfully we only stayed one night.  The gent at the desk arranged a transfer to the airport for us, saying we could expect to pay 50 Euros only to have to pay 100 Euros on arrival at the airport.",1,1
"Maybe not being able to get close to the hotel because of building work, and having to make multiple trips with luggage put me in a less agreeable mood, but the check in was slow, they had no rooms available at 1420, no luggage storage and staff who were disinterested. The room was OK, compared to the room at the Novotel at Les Eiffel is was small and poorly equipped.  Very average.",2,1
"I have just returned from a four night break with my husband and two children in Paris.    Good Points - The Hotel is centrally located and despite the surrounding building work we found it very quiet during the day and evening.  The staff on reception are polite and helpful.  We had breakfast in the restaurant every morning and it was better than we expected.  We never had a problem getting a table as soon as we walked in and the food was replenished quickly.  The foyer is pleasant, but lacks atmosphere compared to the bustling square outside the Hotel.  We had a window that opened wide and we could watch the streets come to life in the morning which was lovely.  We found the beds comfortable and the air conditioning in the room worked well (it was extremely hot during our stay",2,1
"I booked a suite at the Novotel for 2 nights because of it's proximity to the Pompidou. What an awful experience. Here's why;  1. On arrival, nobody helped or even offered to help with my luggage.     2. The elevator opened on the 3rd floor and I immediately smelled old cigarette smoke embedded in the carpets. This place is in desperate need of a renovation. 3. The 'suite' was terrible. I cannot believe they actually charge over €400 per night. Firstly it was old, the furniture is from the early 90s. The shower was dirty with a stained floor. The blinds were filthy, broken and didn't open. BOTH air conditioners didn't cool the room down. The carpet had cigarette burns. The bathroom sink was blocked and the room is so awkward that you have no place to put your suitcase down.",1,1
"I stayed at Les Halles  in a suite for  4 days in July and the hotel was very disappointed at several issues:  Location: Centrally , but a big mess because Les Halles Station construction; surrounding poorly attended and we had certain fear of going out at night.   Rooms: Really bad, outdated furniture, old and stinky carpet, dirty bathroom;  Price : Very expensive for quality",2,1
"The Novotel Les Halles is an unimpressive chain hotel in a terrific Paris location. It is completely lacking in charm or character. The staff were helpful. Rooms are mediocre, at best. Before booking, be aware that there is major construction in front of the Novotel, making it impossible for vehicles to access the front entrance. The entire surrounding area looks like a construction site. We would not recommend the Novotel. There are many much better hotels available in Paris with far more to offer.",2,1
"Bad  ubication, very ugly zone at night. Rooms not like the web page pictures. Novotel out of my vacations list. Standard breackfast sucks. Too much money for a standard room. The service was ok, but not awesome as we suspect.",2,1
We have stayed in the hotel for 4 nights a week ago and complained about the room temperature. They must have a serious issue as the room we were given today was an oven and the air conditioning was set at maximum cold. We asked for help and they said there was nothing they could do. We asked for fans but have yet to see them!,1,1
"My husband and I are very well traveled and tend to stay in 4-5 star hotels. After checking in today after a long flight from LA to Paris we were rather disappointed with the quality/condition of our room. As expected in Paris, the room was tiny... But this was just not as decent as we were expecting (a Marriott courtyard level would have been fine).  We will be booking elsewhere next time we are in town and wish we had other options for the next two nights but had already prepaid.",2,1
"Stayed here for one night in early April.  Like this hotel for its location but during our stay there, Les Halles was under construction and the surrounding area and the road leading to the hotel was blocked for construction.  There isnt much noise, we were not disturbed but you are paying for a premium to stay next to the construction site.  Breakfast is still as good as ever so is the long queue.  Would I come back - Yes, only after the construction on Les Halles is completed.",2,1
"The hotel is beautiful...don't get me wrong. But after a day sightseeing in which I had 150 euro stolen from my bag, I returned to my room to find that money and a credit card had been stolen from my suitcase, which I believed would be safe within the room. The hotel does not provide a safe in the room so my travel wallet was hidden amongst my clothes in the suitcase, but that didn't stop anyone. A member of staff at reception took us to the local police station but other than filing a report, nothing came of it. The hotel did not accept responsibility nor were we offered any compensation (or even a free drink at the bar). To make matters worse, we left the 'do not disturb' sign on the door the next day as we didn't want anyone going into our room, but we returned to find the",1,1
"Stayed one night while I was on business. Took nearly 20 minutes to check in despite a reservation. Only one person at the desk at 7pm when it is normal for business guests to check in. Tv did not work, bathroom was not properly equipped.   The only things in favour of this place is location and included wifi.",2,1
"Though near to everything, but bad location and  not accessible becuase of on-going construction. Getting in and out, difficult by cab. Each cab will drop u different point and u have to navigate your way back. Difficult with luggage and rain.! Staff helpful but not effective. Always point to direction of taxi or restuarant like u know the place well! Even in the rain! Service very poor. During 2nd stay in March, able to check into suite at 4.30pm! No refreshment, no apology..nothing! Called regarding phone charger , adapter re previous week visit... Sorry. Attentive? Effective....no. Will never come back...",2,1
"I have never written a poor hotel review before, and I travel a lot.  Stayed at this hotel many times before, on business. So I know the hotel very well. When sending the direct booking I requested a parking place for my car. They never replied and when I arrived, driving from London, I found that the underground parking was no longer available due to redevelopment .Alternative parking was quite a way away.. This concern got worse when 'non entry' concrete blocks were placed  at the Hotel drive entrance.. This gave us problems putting our luggage in the car at the end of our stay. The staff at reception were slow and unconcerned . It took me 30 minutes+ to check out due to a customer in front of me complaining.  Novotel staff were not concerned about others having to wait a",2,1
"Nice location because of the metro station where you could go anywhere Hotel rooms small and very basic breakfast good,expensive though,not included in the room price. Stuff very good and helpfull Bed matress very bad, the pillows were just for show as if you wanted to sleep it was like sleeping on foam. In general for the price we paid we were not happy.I ve traveled many times and stayed in many hotels around the world,and this one was one of the worst.",2,1
"Really disapointed at this Novotel.   I am always willing to pay whatever it takes to stay in a nice Novotel but always expect good value in return. Not here! Small and really dirty rooms.   Even the Novotels in London and New York are less expensive, cleaner and better, so the phrase ""This is Paris"" do not justify this.",2,1
"It is important to note that this was our second stay with this hotel and I am a Silver Member of the A-Club.  We noticed a dramatic drop in customer service levels and cleanliness.  Air-conditioning turned off due to the fact summer had finished and the hotel was not interested that the room was far too hot (one member of staff made an effort to find another room but it was the same).  This was their policy and so we had to live with it.  Nothing could or would be done about it.  Sleeping was uncomfortable for the duration of our stay (6 nights).  Very noisy outside so could not sleep with window open.  Also, some very unsavoury characters hang around outside the hotel once the sun goes down....they were yelling and carrying on out the front to all hours of the early morning.",2,1
"We've stayed at Novotel a few times now (last in August 2012) but will not return.   The main reasons why you should choose this hotel are:  - Great location even among other well placed hotels in the city centre, which translates into fewer steps between you and the fun and good food in Paris. Since getting a taxi on the street usually is not an option (this is not London or New York; think more Berlin), you'll learn to appreciate close (walking distance) proximity in this town.  - Friendly and helpful front desk in a relatively small but modern lobby, with a nice terrace next door.  - Reasonable prices (during slower periods in Paris; otherwise the prices can be quite stiff)  The main reasons why I would recommend that you choose another place to stay, even if you take the",2,1
"We're a family of 4, including 2 kids, 11 and 6. Location is great, but that's where it ends. No on site car parking (even though the website says it does), major renovations for the next 2 years all round the hotel but the Accor website never mentions it. The first room we got was terrible, four if us in a wardrobe! We asked for a better one and got a larger wardrobe!! Room wasn't cleaned and had to ask for it to be only to be met by 'housekeepers with attitude'! Food average, staff service average except Antoinne who tried hard but he was new. The price we paid was far too much did what we got. If this is 4 star then I'll be left hanging!",2,1
"I was very disappointed in the experience. It said that the hotel had a parking - it was closed for construction .... we had to park the car a couple of streets away in a public parking. Considering that we had chosen the hotel for the parking, I wish they had been more upfront about this. When I complained, they were not very helpful.  The rooms are OK - just what you expect for Paris. The pillows and blankets are very uncomfortable though.   The location is usually good - lbut be aware that currently there is a lot of construction going on around the hotel. Les Halles have been pulled down and a new center is being built.   It is a hotel that is good if you go with children under 12 (the do not make you pay for them), but if you have older children, I would go for a different",1,1
"We stayed in hotels in Switzerland, italy Austria, New York and Paris on this trip. All were comparable in price, certainly not cheap hotels. The first impression of the surrounding area of the hotel was scary, i felt very uncomfortable in this neighborhood. The hotel lobby and reception are very nicely appointed, arriving at the room was horribly disappointing. Very old and although linens looked updated the room was dreadful for over $400 per night. Food in the restaurant was mediocre, breakfast very similar nothing special or overly appetising. Over all this was the worst hotel i stayed in during this 25 day trip.",2,1
"My two kids had been bitten by Mosquitos, and the front desk said, "" There's nothing we can do."" Stupid. REALLY?!!! 300 USD average per night, and this crap?! Although, I've got to admit, the breakfast was delicious, the view was nice, and the concierge was nice, I guess, overall, though, I would never, ever, return to this hotel if my life depended on it. So, next time you go to Paris, do not, ever go to Novotel Les Halles. Their music video is funny! Watch it on YouTube.",2,1
"I recently stayed over a week at les Halles and found the rooms underwhelming to say the least! My first room had mold on the bathroom ceiling and dirty glass rings on the furniture. I'm not confident the room was cleaned other than the bed being made.! Although the staff appeared nice, I could sense them doing their least to make my stay pleasant. There was no extra effort other than saying bonjour with a forced smile and my special requests were ignored ( requesting large taxi's to accommodate my family). I also found the front desk unfamiliar where the closest food markets were, laundry and ATMs. They simply replied, I don't speak English or I am not familiar with the area.    My second room was in better proximity/ inside the courtyard but found that something in my room",1,1
"I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. I stayed in Paris two weeks ago and three of the nights stayed at this hotel. I found the rooms to be equivalent to what you would find at a university dorm room. Beds and room are basic; the carpet in my room was visibly dirty and the toilet is in a seperate room not in the bathroom which is totally stupid and inconvenient. On my first day I asked a staff member about purchasing tickets for the hop-on hop off bus and where I could find them - I am bilingual and therefore spoke to him in French. He was completely unable to help me and was pretty much useless. I ended up finding the tour buses on my own.   While the location of the hotel is ideal as there is a subway station exit right outside the doors, that is the ONLY thing great",2,1
Not a good start – Very bad service from reservations! Novotel does not honor its guarantee! I booked and made an advance purchase on Monday 7th May 2012 on Novotel’s website for an executive room at Novotel Paris Les Halles for 4 nights in June 2012.  I did not bother to compare prices on other websites and had peace of mind while booking on Novotel online reservation as Novotel prides itself for offering the lowest price with a BEST PRICE GUARANTEE.  This turned out to be a BIG mistake as Novotel did not offer the lowest price and specially does NOT HONOR its supposedly guarantee! On the same day that the booking was made I found out that another website was offering a lower price per night for the same room with the same conditions at Novotel Paris Les Halles. I spontaneously,1,1
"We are currently moving from the UK to Paris and using the Novotel as our base. Tonight we ordered pretty basic room service and ended up in a full argument, in our room with a staff member. After ordering we had a call to say they wouldn't have any fries for two hours, was this okay or would we substitute for potato? We agreed however when it arrived this had been substituted again with a bowl of plain rice. When we pointed this out the staff member shrugged and said he'd be back. (no apology) When he returned we pointed out that the 'Novotel Burger' didn't have a bread bun, but instead a slice of potato on either side. Also that the pasta had a measly helping of sauce and that the side of green beans were so overlooked they were actually almost mush. Again a shrug and 'I'll",2,1
"As  a relatively frequent visitor to Paris, I have been on the look out for a regular hotel that ticks the boxes of location, quality and price. Not an easy one. Thought I had found it with Novotel Les Halles. That was until Monday morning when the construction work began outside. From 7am the sound of reversing trucks beeping and concrete being drilled pneumatic ally filled our room. Paying extra for the executive room did not mean being on a quieter side of the hotel. Even asking for a quiet room didn't do the trick. I raised the issue with front desk and received a standard looking email saying the noise was outside their control. This is true but until 2016 ( yes that is his long construction is planned) stay away from Novotel Les Halles if you sleep later than 7am on week",1,1

"We stayed three nights from 26 October (2 adults/2 children) from London. Although a great location, we always had to search how to find the hotel and never managed to work out how to exit at the right metro exit. Upon arrival we were met by protesters (cleaning staff). We thought it was a local festival! But soon realised that cut up newspaper in the lobby and banging on drums and whistling, posters and shouting meant something was up. You couldn't hear yourself think. We were quickly taken to the first floor make shift check in and shown to our room before we could change our minds. Our room was 'ok' but didn't meet the standards of reception area etc. Room size and beds for kids was better than expected, but if you stay in room 420 beware of wet carpet from the shower outside",1,1
The lobby is filled with confetti and loud drumming staff on strike. No apologies or compensation from the hotel. Long line for breakfast table.,1,1
"My boyfriend and I booked this for our last night in Europe before heading home to Australia after a month traveling.  We were hoping for a nice relaxing evening and an early night but it was thwarted by the hotel cleaning staff protesting.  The protesting cleaners (at least a dozen of them) spent their time chanting, playing a vuvuzela (think the loud annoying instrument played during the Sth African soccer World Cup), djembe drums and ripping up tissues and throwing them all over the place.  It would have been OK if the cleaners stayed in one area of the hotel, but they were allowed to parade all over the hotel, through the lobby and up onto the room floors.  We went down the bar to try and escape them when they came around level 1, but then they came back down the the",2,1

It took several minutes for security to intervene and nobody at reception wanted to call the police  in the morning of the 1st night, despite the do not disturb sign, I found tthe maid in my bedroom when I came back from my meeting. As I expected nobody to come in had left my computer on! I complained to the reception immediately and they said that the manager would call me. I waited 3 hours and he did not.

I had a room at the front of the hotel (above the entrance). In the morning, at 6 am I could not sleep anymore because of continious rasping noise, caused by construction workers just outside the hotel. 3. I got a room on the ""smoking"" floor (unbelievable that is still possible in the EU), although I asked for a non-smoking room. The ventilation system blew smoke into my room. 4.

"I brought my elderly mother to your hotel and booked saying I needed a disabled person’s room. The room was very poor.  I was less cross until I was sent a customer satisfaction email survey. I filled this in but it crashed on me, presumably because I wrote in and complained.  There are 5 things that you could do to improve your disabled rooms. This is the fourth time I have inputted this into your hotel chain and I am becoming very angry at the impression that you do not listen.  1.	There are no alarms in the room. This is a really big problem. Alarm cords needed in bedroom and bathroom in case of falls. 2.	There was a bath in a room for disabled people, really stupid. A walk in shower with a seat in it would have been good. My mother could not properly  wash or bathe for her",2,1
We were so disappointed in this hotel!  I'm not sure where to begin...  First - when we arrived - I had to use the woman's room in the lobby and it was FILTHY.  2 of the toilettes were backed up and it looked as though it hadn't been cleaned in days. But I also figured it was a Sunday so maybe the cleaning staff hadn't cleaned it over the weekend.   But then we got to our room.... what a ridiculous configuration!  There is a stand alone toilette as you walk in.  I found it very strange to use a toilette in one little room without a sink to wash your hands and then have to walk around into your actual sleeping area to use the rest of the bathroom.   The bed was like a futon mattress.  It was miserable as were the pillows.  The shower head was broken in the shower and hence,2,1

For instance -   The shower in my room was broken - I had to wedge a piece of paper in it to make the showerhead stay up at the right height.   The water coming from the bathroom tap smelled bad, for the duration of my stay.   The pillows were really uncomfortable.   The room was kind of poky, and had a terrible view.

May be this is the usual standard of service in Paris as I heard from others that most hotels there lack service, but no excuse for cleanliness. Location is nice as it is near down town and many places.",1,1
When in Paris on business I normally stay in the Novotel Paris La Defence - which I really ought to review as I have never had a bad stay there.  Unfortunately this time La Defence was booked up so I stayed in the Novotel Paris Les Halles.    This hotel is pricy for what you get - but that comes from being in the tourist centre of Paris.  The rooms are fine - standard Novotel rooms.  The hotel is surrounded by bars and restaurants but I chose to eat in as I wanted a quick meal.  Unfortunately there were mice running around the floor of the restaurant and the waiters seemed more concerned with the fact that I was planning to walk out without paying (because of the mice) rather than the mice themselves  (which seemed to be a more fundamental problem to me!),2,1
"For the period of our stay, booking with expedia.com the price was over 200 euros and this hotel is not worthy of that. The hotel is located next to a metro stop and a short walk to the Seine. Unfortunately, the area around the hotel always smelled of urine. Sadly, it was far from what I was expecting. The hotel, good looking on the outside, is quite old and needs refurbishment. The lobby was comfortable while using the free wi-fi. But the sofas were old and stained . We stayed in Rome and Venice in 4 star hotels paying less and  Italian rooms were much bigger and stylish ( see my  pics) . Fortunately the staff was friendly and the breakfast was great ( was included in our price.) But I wouldn't go back to this hotel. It’s barely 3 star hotel ( compared to the Italian ones ) and",2,1

The Check in experience is less than friendly and it's almost like you are being made to feel it is beneath  talking to.  At check the clerk answered,2,1
This hotel has no character - room was drab with stained carpets and the hallway carpet looked very dirty.  The breakfast was average and the location lacked any French charm. I would not stay in this hotel again.,2,1
"Be forewarned that the Novotel Les Halles is currently undergoing major renovations.  Extraordinarily, the hotel has considered it acceptable not to advise customers when accepting bookings, taken pre-payments or at check-in.  Be assured however that loud drilling and hammering will wake you early in the morning and make you abundantly aware of construction works.  Details. We first became aware of renovation works when we were given rooms on a floor in which works were taking place in the hallway. Higher floors (5 & 6) were being completed remodeled.   After tripping over wiring and building materials we returned to reception to request another floor.  Reception's initial response was surprisingly dismissive. ( ""Renovations are taking place.

"Having been with my wife for one year to the day of our hotel booking, we decided on taking a short break to Paris.  I booked this hotel based on its location and reviews however an unfortunate event happened where in the week before we were set to go, I had my passport stolen.  Passports take a minimum of two weeks to be reproduced (esp if stolen) and so I didn't think too much as we could just move the Eurostar and hotel bookings back by two weeks.  Thanks to Novotel who earnt over 8.1 billion in turnover last year, they are unwilling to change the date of my booking back by two weeks.  At £170 a night I would expect some form of help in my circumstance but no.  I will never for the rest of my days, book a room in any Novotel again.",1,1

"I got a good price for this hotel, so I end up disappointed, but not extremely angered.  The hotel is certainly well located. But this is not a 4 stars hotel. Plastic glasses in room, cheap linen, cheap bedding, depressing hallways. You are not in any ways staying in a top hotel.   I visit Paris regularly and I generally went to three stars hotel which are much more classy, clean, elegant than this anonymous bland hotel. Taking into account that ""4 stars"" is the top category for hotels in Paris, I wonder how the Novotel Les Halles got 4 stars.   At half the price, this would be a good choice, but never a place where you will feel the charm of a real Parisian hotel, the Novotel is an anonymous industrial product.",2,1
"We stayed at the Novotel Les Halles for 6 nights in September and were absolutely appalled with it.    We chose this hotel because of it's proximity to the RER/Metro and the ease of getting to/from the airport, and this really is the only thing going for it.  We arrived on the train, and the exit that leads directly to the Novotel wasn't open, so we ended up having to walk through the Forum shopping mall, then weaving our way around the outside mall to find it.    We found the entrance and were kind of disgusted to see about 9 Novotel employees crowding the doorway having a cigarette.  We currently live in  China, and absolutely everybody smokes wherever they like so this wasn't much of a surprise, but this type of behaviour from staff didn't really give a good first impression",1,1
"We stayed at the Novotel Les Halles for 4 nights at the end of a two week trip. Check in was ridiculously slow. We had several suitcases with us since we had been visiting family abroad. There were no bell boys or even any carts for us to use to take our luggage to our room. We had to struggle to carry everything ourselves. There was a long wait for the elevators which were also always crowded. The room was average. The bathroom was ""weird"" in my husband's words. When we would shower the whole bathroom would get wet due to lack of a shower curtain. The only thing we really liked was the location. Next time we would definitely stay at a different hotel.",2,1
"I booked this hotel as it is well known hotel chain.  It was our 15th wedding anniversary and wanted something special, and at 480 euros for 2 nights, although quite expensive, thought it would be nice and was willing to pay a little extra as booked a superior room.    Got to the hotel and check in was quick and chap on reception spoke good english and was very pleasant.  Got to room but was disappointed - it was a basic room with a double bed and settee that presumably converted into a bed.  Decor was very bland and bathroom nothing special.  Although room was clean, disappointed that room appeared no more than a family room.  Enquired at reception (to a different member of staff) about whether room was family room or superior room, advised that it was a family room and that no",2,1
"The hotel is superficially very nice looking, with  contemporary and smart decor...and prices to match. The maintenance was poor tho. Only one of the 3 small lifts worked, so inevitably there were always queues so we used the stairs all weekend. There was a leak in the lobby so buckets and water were laid  in front of the lifts.   The look of the place was let down by the distinct whiff of sewers on the gound floor, which may explain why I saw no-one dining in the restauant. Our friends had to change rooms as theirs smelled of sewers (on the 5th floor!) and smoke, the toilet was in bits and the room was tiny. Their next room was very spacious and had a great view (as did ours) but the toilet wouldnt stop running.   Wasnt worth the price, but would have been if the place was in",2,1
"As another reviewer commented, the hotel is very conveniently located with both RER and the Metro interchange within the Les Halles Forum. Shopping & transport is therefore literally on your doorstep. Bars, brasseries and restaurants are again all within walking distance. Close to Hotel de Ville, Notre Dame and the Louvre. However, that is all on the ‘plus’ side. The hotel itself lets its great location down by the bucket load. For some unknown reason, The Novotel Paris Les Halles chooses to describe itself as one of a few Novotel’s in France that has been awarded four stars.  There is an air of grubbiness as soon as you approach the forecourt of the hotel. That goes with the general location of the area but still no reason why no general maintenance or daily wash down is not",2,1
"In typical Paris fashion once again we were very disappointed with our accommodation. Having stayed at the awful Le Meridien Etoile the previous year we hoped that Novotel would prove a better choice. NOT!  We booked a ""Junior Suite/Family Room"". We arrived at a hotel with one person doing check in (there were about 5 families waiting in line).   Our room was tiny with a double bed and two pull out couch beds. The double bed was typical of something you would sleep on in a hospital or hostel. Terrible, uncomfortable and quite disappointing.   The hotel lacks any soul, has terrible smells emanating from who knows where.  Although it's billed as a 4-Star hotel it is probably a 3-Star at best. No concierge either? And no porter to assist with luggage?  The only redeeming feature of",1,1
"We stayed in the Hotel for a Family Birthday weekend and must say that we were very disappointed. The Novotel Paris les Halles is really only suited as a budget business hotel, not for a nice romantic getaway. The whole hotel has a dated late-80s feel to it.  Location The location is fine, with minutes from Paris Les Halles, Centre Pompidou and La Cite.  Rooms & Amenities The rooms are in desperate need of an overhaul; it seems that apart from the lobby area, the hotel was renovated in the early nineties. The carpets and beds are threadbare, the bathrooms old and scuffed, the TVs small, the whole place feels neglected. There are a bar and a restaurant also, and a reasonably nice lounge area.  Breakfast Breakfast has a poor choice, and unless you come very early, you are likely",2,1
"Novotel Les Halles has the perfect location in Paris, but prices are also so steep that I haven’t stayed there for many years. However, just ahead of my last trip, I changed my reservation to Novotel, because I learned from Tripadvisor that the hotel that I had initially booked had its reception a flight of stairs up and also had had problems with their elevators. My travel companion had (fortunately temporary) reduced mobility and we didn’t want to risk anything. A Novotel for me is a no-glamour but a no-surprise experience, and that’s why it can be worth to pay a premium compared to other hotels of the same class. First surprise, at 12.30, only two persons in this 300 room hotel were working to handle the enormous queues of hotel guests checking in and out, including the",2,1
"I recently returned from a trip to Paris staying at the Novotel Les Halles and unfortunately have to say I was disappointed.  Whilst clean and relatively comfortable I felt the hotel was quite cheap and nasty and not worth the amount they charge for a room.  The lobby area is nice but once we went up the lifts to our floor we found a different scene entirely – cheap, dirty, synthetic carpets with raw steel used for signage ( not In a modern way but in a cheap and easy way) and hideous paintings on the walls.  The lifts too were broken most of the time we stayed there meaning there was often only one or two functioning lifts for the entire hotel. This could mean waiting anything up to 5 minutes for a lift.  The room itself wasn’t the best either...it was small and pokey with",2,1
Just came back after spending three nights at this hotel. The location is perfect. The RER (light train) will bring you directly to Les Halles. from Charles de Gaulle. If you get the right exit you will be directly outside the hotel main entrance. (exit 10 use the lift). Upon arrival the hotel room was not ready. Returning at check in time (3 o’clock) quite some queue had formed. After a very long wait because check in was extremely long-winded we were treated courteous by an English speaking receptionist. One out of three lifts didn’t work. The lift was not repaired during our stay. This caused long waiting time to get a lift. We had a junior suite at 6th floor. Beautiful view of Les Halles and all the way to Sacré Coeur. Queen sized bed that was really to small for two people,2,1
"The only points I can give this hotel are for location and working air conditioning in July.  It was fabulous being such a short walk from the Louvre, the Notre Dame, the Hotel de Ville, and Musee d'Orsay.  We stayed for 2 nights the first weekend in July 2006 and could not have gotten worse service.  The room was never cleaned.  My biggest problem was wanting to take a shower after touristing under the July sun and finding massive amounts of MILDEW in the shower.  It was not cleaned the entire time we were there even though we complained twice.  My husband complained that the bed was much too stiff, but we are used to a double pillowtop mattress at home.  Our room also didn't have an alarm clock (as their website said it would) & all of our wake up calls were ""forgotten"" by the",2,1

If Priceline website didn't say that this is a 4-star, I wouldn't be so dissappointed and angry. The carpet looks like at least 10 years old, poor quality bed, grey dirty marks in the bath tub (like the picture in a previous posting).

Tiny toilet room with toilet paper holder with a lock on it! as if people there have a tendency to steal toilet paper from a 200+ Euro room!  of coarse - expensive Internet connection and limited TV channel selection.  service: the worst I have seen in any European hotel.

The bathroom though is disgusting, I actually took photo of the shower cubicle, with green slimy stuff.  We first thought it was condensation, it wasn't, they are just not cleaning it properly.  How anyone can leave a bathroom like that is beyond me.  You can lift some of the dirt with your finger.

First off, the location is great and the lobby would lead you to believe that this is indeed a 4* hotel.  However, the hallways appear as if they belong on an old ship. Once we checked in to our non-smoking room, I was overwhelmed by the musty smell of old smoke. The furnishings were all well past their prime, and the carpet was worn (almost through the floor). They don't have an alarm clock or a refrigerator, and the shower head can only be mounted for a shorter person and is very uncomfortable to use.

We were unable to sleep at night due to constant door banging and assorted cacophany from the internal hotel, such as adjacent rooms. Every door slam or or banging noise seemed to be amplified.  Airconditioning is simply a 3 speed fan control with a temperature setting control that is not connected to anything. Basicly, you get one temperature of air as selected by management. You cannot control the temperature from your room control panel. Obviously a cheapskate cost saving measure. Our room was hot at night.

While the lobby is marble contemporary, the remainder of the hotel is anything but. In the hallways, you sort of get that ""industrial"" feel with the cieling in the corridors being a ""steel mesh"" where you can see the electrical conduits, piping, fixtures, etc if you look through the mesh. The signs in the corridors are on thick pieces of galvanized metal suspended by chains. The room numbers are written on the carpet floor. The room itself, very blah.

When you go to a major capital city you are well aware that your room may be on the petite size and that is more than acceptable. However at Armoni your room is minute and very dark chocolate brown - you feel like you're in a rabbit warren on entering the hotel and rooms.   There is minimal lighting throughout the hotel and you are often wandering around in near pitch black looking for a light switch in the corridor (they don't come on automatically).   Reception is minimalist - nicely decorated with small desk and staff are polite but not in the least bit friendly. You seem like a bit of an inconvenience being there.

I'll be brief, but if you like hotels where the sheets aren't changed from previous guests - dried blood and hair on the sheets then armoni is for you.

We tried contacting the hotel explaining the situation in hopes that they would at least somewhat understand and refund us not the whole amount we had paid but at least a portion. I understand that many hotels have policies where if you cancel last minute, you will get charged for 1 or 2 nights usually.

Don't expect to hang any long clothes as the wardrobe is just a hole above the safe, and there are no tea/coffee facilities or even a kettle.

"On the plus side, the location is good.  However, without a doubt, this hotel has the worst beds.  Just imagine sleeping on an ironing board and that gives you the picture of the hotel's cheap mattresses and couple that with pillows equally as hard.

Even though I had pre-arranged the detail of the booking, both through my work travel agent and a phone call prior to arrival, on arrival they insisted on an additional charge of 80 euros for 2 of my 3 nights. No customer service whatsoever, just simply ‘I don’t know who you spoke to, our system says this...’.  I should have read some of the negative reviews on here as there are consistent themes of opportunistic over charging, bad service and sub-par basic facilities expected for even a 3 star hotel never mind a hotel classing themselves as a 4 star!

The main reason I chose this one was because of the swimming pool that was advertised on the website, but actually it doesn’t exist and when I pointed this out to the receptionist he shrugged his shoulders in the great offhand Parisian tradition.

Upon check out, they gave me the wrong check out, with all the personal details of another woman! I contacted the hotel directly and never heard a word back.   However, I will say there were a few staff members who were lovely and tried to help us out, like finding a fan for our room, and getting us a taxi... or finding some water for our room because the mini bar was NEVER refreshed.

The hotel and employees seem to be exceptionally worried about charging customers  for all services rendered rather than about helping their guests to be COMFORTABLE.   BATHROOM WAS DIRTY!

Not cheap but no offer of reduction or moving of rooms We love Paris and return often but certainly wont be returning to the Melia,1,1
I arrived with my client and solicitor to check in. They claimed I only booked one room despite my email confirmation showing two. The staff were not really empathetic. Any other hotel would just give you a room (if you pay) but this one just insisted on saying there is a problem with my booking. I was double charged and the drinks offered as compensation were also charged to my card. I eventually got a refund. The manager Tamara has still not responded to two promises for her to call me back. Very embarrasing. We had to go to the Marriott hotel and the difference in staff attitude was amazing. Would not be staying at any Melia hotels on the future based on this experience and perceived racial profiling by their staff.,1,1
"Would not put anyone I liked or loved up here.  The carpets in the rooms are stained the bed skirt was ripped in multiple places.  The WIFI does not work, the lights kept going on and off.  One morning I did not have hot water.  There is no plug in the bathroom for a hair dryer you I had to sit on the floor in the room in front of the mirror to dry my hair.  The breaksfast is the only redemening factor and the friendly staff.  The only thing is the service is super slow so be prepared to wait for a Cappucino for over 15 minutes you will be done with breakfast before it arrives.  Also the omelette station was mostly vacant, so good luck ordering an omelette.",2,1
"older hotel that has not been updated, no washcloths, young staff who aren’t swift to move on requests. they aren’t very knowledgeable of many things... not even sure if they have a concierge. very underwhelming",2,1
"I really liked most of our stay. The breakfast buffet was excellent & the staff was very warm and helpful. That is until they lost a shirt I requested to be laundered. We were very clear about the cost and time required to launder a shirt, yet the day before our checkout, my shirt was still not returned to me. Upon check out I provided my home address and information so that once my shirt was recovered, it could be mailed to me at home. This was 3 weeks ago. Not only was my shirt never returned to me, but each time I reach out to the hotel, they do not respond to me. I do not appreciate this lack of care and customer service. The shirt they lost was purchased just a week prior and costs nearly $100. I wonder if it was stolen. So, I suppose if you are comfortable with this type",2,1
"We have stayed at Melia hotels before and always had a good experience - - until now. We had originally booked in the Melia Colbert on the Left Bank, which was a beautiful hotel and lovely room. Unfortunately, it was a heat wave and the a/c did not work so they kindly transferred us to the Vendome property.  This hotel is in a great area - close to the Louvre, restaurants, shopping, etc... - but the hotel itself is pretty charm-free.  That would not have been a problem if not for the room which was really unpleasant in just about every way.  The a/c was infinitesimal; barely a whisper of air coming out of one vent in the doorway. I understand that it is Europe and that Paris generally does not get that hot. At the same time, this is a major chain hotel and I expected some level",2,1
This was my 10th trip to Paris and I decided to try the Melia Vendome for the first time.  It will be my last time as it was necessary to change rooms 3 times in order to get a room with no street noise.  The rooms on the lower floors and facing the street are extremely noisy.  The rooms were also hot  since the air-conditioning had been turned off for the season.  The windows in my first 2 rooms could not be  opened due to noise.  The 3rd room was fine.,2,1
"My colleague have asked for early check in for today and the reception said they didn't receive the request and because we paid the basic room.   No other counter solution except either I pay more for an upgrade or saying they can offer me to keep my luggage for FREE . What a joke ? Which hotel doesn't keep the baggage for free?  The guy at reception service is unbelievably bad and blame on my booking instead. I have never checked in such a unwelcoming hotel in Paris!!  And yes I am sitting at the lobby here waiting for a "" basic room""",1,1
"Smell of old mold alreday at the entrance Stuffay room with insufficient air-condition Noisy and not quite at all in the room, difficult to sleep old tv cabinet old broken wardrobes old broken chair too small restaurant",1,1
"I stayed at the hotel on June 20th. It was terribly hot. The AC was not working and we were told there was no there room to move. An technician said they would bring a ventilador, but never came. I called 4 times to the reception asking for something to be done. I complained at the check in desk also 3 times .  I even asked for a discount as I was paying 500 euros for a room that seemed a sauna. And we were not having any type of help. Response was ""that is not my decision"" "" the manager will contact you"". Never happened. I absolutely expect other type of treatment from a Melia at 500 euros the night. It was an awful experience. We couldnt even sleep.",2,1
"Bad service, dull and not fresh serving on breakfast. Had to ask for gel and toilet paper. Check the invoice, we were charged twice on extra breakfast and minibar we did not use. Good location, in the luxurious center of the city.",2,1
"We went there with the family, occupying 5 rooms of different types. The facilities are ok, the rooms being wider than most of Parisian hotels' rooms. However, need to fix lots of little things that make you feel not being in a 4-star hotel: some furniture is old, have scratches; in a double room -2 people occupancy- need to be 2 dental kit, enough shampoo and gel and of course 2 big towels and were not; some bathtubs not draining; bed linen dirty (that was disgusting); etc. The breakfast was good, but not enough glasses, cutlery, and other material; and most important, they lack of staff and the staff need to be properly trained. The reception staff made a mess with the rooms -not giving us the type of rooms we reserved-, and even if we totally understand anyone can make",2,1
"This is the saddest hotel in a beautiful area of Paris. I chose this hotel because it was very close to my business appointment. I am not going back! I upgraded for the superior room (80$ more)since when I walked into the standard room (280$) I was afraid I was going to hang myself after one day by in there. It was soooo small and old. The superior room was a little better as far as space, but everything else was depressing. Decor and furniture are old, the carpet is full of stains. The bathroom had 1 roll of the scratchier toilet paper ever, just one of everything, including towels and a broken trash can. Definitively not a luxury hotel for 360$ a night! Plus my keycard was never working and I had to go downstairs twice to get into my room. Stay somewhere else in Paris, would",1,1
Booked the day before and this was the only available room I could find. Hotel is OK and staff friendly. However the room was not up to standards. There was a terrible smell of cold cigarette and the mattress was worn out you could feel every spring. The window of the bathroom could t be closed.  So clearly there is some work to be done to the rooms.,2,1
Agree with previous reviewer. This hotel's management is poor. Staff are not being directed correctly. That is very clear. The cleaning schedule is 'hit and miss' ; the billing is inaccurate. Cleaning up water and glass after one display container was broken took 6 hours! Finally our toilet was rediculously small. My wifi at home in the Dordogne is far better (Paris!),2,1
"The location is great however the room is lacking in basic amenities such as tea or coffee making facilities, having wine glasses available in the room and there is no gym or fitness lounge. Any orders (e.g. for wine glasses up to the room) will incur a room service charge of 4.30 euros.   Staff are friendly but basic hotel services are absent such as getting help with your luggage from the taxi into the hotel.",2,1
"Was a regular customer to this hotel with great location near louvre and shops. But requesting quiet room ending up next to elevator at check in at 2pm to be told by unfriendly reception desk personnel and manager that nothing can be done is unbelievable. Ticking noises fro next door bathroom. Dated top floor bathroom and furniture. Next day upon return after day out was told a 4pm that we were contacted at 11am to see if we wanted another room as we were not in they were reallocated and again nothing could be done. Again unfriendly response from reception,personnel. Clearly indicating our feelings about unhappy experience. Even at check out no response about the stay to ologize or even recognize the emotions. Busy period is understood but unfriendly attitude with arrogance is",1,1
"I been a regular customer of Melia Vendome and always visit during the busy times of Fashion Week. The whole city is teaming with fashionistas and the hotel is a great location and super convenient.  However this time round, I find the service sorely lacking. The staff - while friendly - are not very efficient right from the bookings team to the front office.   I specifically asked for a couple of things to be placed in my room - from email requests to direct requests at the front office - 6X I asked for firm pillows to no avail. I finally marched down to the reception to physically just take them and I got my firm pillows finally!   There is no turn down service - u draw yr curtains yourself and the design of the shower area leaves a lot to be desired - the partition makes u",1,1
"The location is just beautiful! And this is perhaps its  one and only  advantage)). Thanks to Melia Vendome - now  I know that the king size bed is just two shifted tiny beds),  but it's not the worst thing in this hotel: we've got a room what was facing to the courtyard (small and narrow), as it was impossible to turn on the air conditioning  - it was located so that blew right into our heads and workde so loud that my ears were tingled)), and we decided to open the window, it became even worse - air-conditioning system of the hotel was leaded out into the courtyard!!!!!! The fans were working constantly day & night!!!!!!! Of course you can close the windows and turn off the fan, but you will just suffocate as it is so stuffy into the room!I  i think it was  too expensive",2,1
"Poor service overall Overpriced hotel in relation to overall infrastructures, decor, age, maintenance and cleanliness  Poor or inoperative Wi Fi connection Poorly maintained rooms Small rooms Poor lighting in rooms Noisy Poor Bar service",1,1
"Stayed 3 nights. Lets keep this simple. Hot water is luke warm, complained twice after being told it will be 40C but that never happened. Had to sort out a bunch of kids from South America making noise at 2 am because front desk is 1 person who cant leave the front desk. The room is sold as a double but you get 2 single beds but when you complain they give you bull%^$# story that double bed is less space so better keep twin beds. You dont mind way over the odds because the location is superb but also have to mention that if you want to sleep after 8 am then the room cleaners make that impossible as they make it sound they are reconstructing the room next to you.",1,1
"This Review is for the Hotel's Bar/Lounge  Last Thursday, having dressed quicker than my husband, I went down to the hotel’s bar/lounge for a cocktail prior to a dinner celebration for our 28th anniversary.  What a mistake!  The bar is directly off the hotel’s lobby.  As I crossed the threshold the bartender, approximately 15 feet from me called out in French.  As I did not respond, he switched to English and loudly asked ‘do you want something to drink’.  His question caught me by surprise considering all he was doing was standing behind the bar and wiping out a glass in an empty lounge!  It was immediately obvious that he expected me to come up to the bar to place my drink order…so much for a lounge atmosphere!  I placed my ‘vodka tonic’ order and found a comfortable couch to",2,1

"Hotel website advertises ""air conditioning"" for our Premium room.  We're trying to sleep with windows open because there is NO air conditioning!  With all the street noise there will be little sleep. Very disappointing!  Great location but no a/c really?",1,1
"I just stayed 4 nights last week (10-14 Dec 2011).  I chose this hotel because of the so-called discount thru zuji, a discount which I found out later not so significant.  I paid around 160 euros, not cheap anyway.  I was also misled by the word ""boutique"", which usually means accommodation with characteristics, design or personalized service.  However, it turned out to be actually the biggest mistake among my many trips to Paris.    In terms of the location, I have nothing to complain, it is indeed the centre of the centre.  The moment I arrived at the entrance, I was impressed by the bright illumination, clean marble floor and a tidy lobby.  But I could hardly appreciate further.  I approached the front desk and the female staff was on the phone.  Fine but it had been a long",1,1
"During a heatwave in Paris, there was no airconditioning, as advertised. My husband and I had paid beforehand via  hotels.com, so we could not get a refund.  We spent four sleepless nights (Everyone was leaving after they discovered this and had NOT pre-paid), and were supposed to return there (after Italy) for the last two.  Fortunately we got to stay at an airconditioned hotel at the end.  We lost an enormous amount of money. . .  and time, which is priceless.   The hotel advertises a business center. There is one computer in the public area. People wait, but to no avail,  since there is always someone sitting there who has paid for at least an hour's usage.  They advertise the usual amenities. To my mind, this does not mean thin, cheap towels and the absence of the usual",1,1
"My first experience with this hotel took place a few years back when I stayed at the Melia Vendome for a week. I found the room smallish and not decorated with the level of sophistication one would expect from a Paris boutique hotel. My room faced rue Mont-Thabor and every morning there were incredibly noisy deliveries to the hotel basement beneath my window. The bedcovers were made of cheap material that spread white lint all around.   Service was unremarkable. There was one silly incident when, during a weekend, I informed the receptionist that a lightbulb had gone out in my room. She answered that a technician would fix it next monday earliest! I even offered to replace it myself. Finally an experienced maid appeared and took care of the matter. After this I decided to try",1,1
"We stayed at the Melia Vendome for 10 days recently (Nov 2007) and came back very disappointed with the hotel facilities and overall service.  Let me just start by saying that on our second night we were awaken by a couple of mice that were trying to binge on some the flakes of a left over croissant (the bag was in a trash can). After making the front desk aware of this situation, they responded as lazily as if I had just requested an extra set of sheets.  The rooms (we tried 2 different ones) are poorly ventilated and have no air conditioning. You need to keep the windows open almost the entire time or the room will quickly get warm. And since we were afraid of mice jumping in from an open window, we just were uncomfortable the whole time.  The hotel had two very claustrophobic",2,1
"First, the good part: fab location steps from cool cafes, etc.  Good A.C. Quiet, decent-sized room for the price, cleaned well, well-meaning staff. BUT: there were glitches in the room they gave us (low floor facing street with ugly view, opposite of what we asked for.  Confusion about check out times.) Young, somewhat confused-seeming staff. The room looked much nicer in photos: in reality everything seems flimsy, cheap, and the harsh lighting design doesn't help, nor the fact that when you turn lights on you hear a violent thump implying primitive wiring. Nice to have coffee machine, but zero in refrigerator. Spacious bathroom was a nightmare: door barely closed.  Toilet set on wall so high that even a man's feet dangle above the floor.  Surgical bright lighting that can't be",2,1
The reservation was for a double bed and they gave us twin. we requested a change but there was no availability. rooms with central heating. so if for some reason it was cold you had no choice. Also stink. the staff marginally polite with the exception of the breakfast staff which was great. means of transportation just outside the hotel that take you everywhere. Safe neighborhoods,2,1
"I've been working in hotels the last 12 years and I think is the fisrt time that someone denied me to have some water.  There was not water in the room, already unexpected, but I went to reception to buy a bottle of it and the receptionist that I needed to woke up (as he was sleeping in the sofa) told me that I need to use the vending machine, somenthing that was also fine for me.   I went to the room, picked up some money (unfortunately I didn't have coins) so take a 10€ note and ask to the receptionist is he was able to give some change, so, here start the most unpleasant situation...he told me that he was not able to give me coins as they do not have any money during the night shift, furthermore is also suppossed that they do not have water at breakfast service, as I",2,1
"Completely overrated, not ever again. Location is ok just near the metro Station (Porte d’Orleans) BUT the room is not ready when clients check in : first the electronic key didn’t work and it seems it happens sudden, second the safe box was unable to use since it has the previous client code, and third there was a leak in the sink. So it is not a good impression to arrive and needing to go back to the front desk for different issues, plus not having the ley and needing the responsible of the front desk to go up to the room every time I  needed yo enter.... he was very polite but this kind of hotel is not what a client expects. They do not supply the bathroom amenities for the second day. I fortunately had soap and shampoo in my luggage. They charged the room in advance so I",1,1
During the check in they assured us that the breakfast was included in the price but then made us pay for it. Only slightly reducing the price after our complaints. Extremely incompetent staff or fraudulent intentions?,1,1
"I have to say this out loud. You need to inform people that you have to go up a winding stairs before ever getting on the elevator. And the person who facilitated check in, said....don’t you see I am alone here? when I asked for his help with the luggage. And your lift can barely fit two people with a bag and would be such a struggle for anyone claustrophobic. It would have been a horror story if my disabled Mom was with us. Just be honest in describing your facilities. This hotel is also too far from the city center, its expensive to take a taxi but there is a metro line that could be a plus. The room was okay and small but that was expected.",2,1
"AVOID - this hotel is awful!  We arrived at the hotel before the check-in time so we were asked to come back at 2pm. We left our luggage at the hotel and went exploring in Paris.  We came back at 2.25pm and asked for our room at which point Syed at reception said our room was not ready and was currently being cleaned. We were quite tired by this time so literally wanted to go to the room and relax. We therefore asked what the hold-up was and Syed became both aggressive and defensive. He kept saying it wasn't his fault and it was the previous people that delayed their check-out. We stressed that we were told to return at 2pm and did so after this time. Syed then called the room service (the cleaner) and demanded that she come to reception and apologise to us, which she did.  Syed",1,1
"The way hotels work is that you book and then you arrive and they give you a room. This was not my experience at the Acropole. I booked the hotel 5 weeks before on their website - received a confirmation of my booking. The day before my arrival I received a mail - 'the cancellation of your reservation is noted..' Cancelled by who? Certainly not by me. Since Paris is very busy in June I spent two hours sitting in an airport to find another hotel. Repeatedly mailed the Acropole for an explanation and didn't even get a reply, leave alone an offer of an alternative hotel. What happened - their system, they got a better offer? Since they don't explain I guess they don't care very much. Avoid.",1,1
Stayed for 2 nights at the hotel and I don t have much positive to say about it. The service is very poor. The didn t make our bed properly and didn t replenish amenities (basically shampoo and soap). We asked to book a taxi to the airport and the front desk agent told us THE HOTEL CHARGES AN EXTRA 8€ fee for this!!!!! UNBELIEVABLE. There s really nothing special about the hotel. Room was clean but extra extra small. No space to walk around even when we had to small luggage. Elevator is claustrophobic and you have to take your luggage by yourself to the stairs. R,2,1
"We stayed at this hotel for five nights. The room was very small, but quite clean when we arrived. For the other days, they barely cleaned the toilet and made up the bed. The last two days we could not use the sink, because it was plugged. We asked several times to fix it, but the reception gave us just general replies, such as ""I will speak with my boss"", ""I supposed was already fixed"", ""You have problems with Internet, don't you?""...so we washed the teeth in the shower! When we left, they apologize, but no refund for the bad service. Really unprofessional.",2,1
"Overall the staff were utterly incompetent. I have several examples of this. First, we asked the front desk to print out a voucher needed for a tour. The individual behind the desk did not know how to use a computer. Specifically he had a problem locating my email and once he found it could not figure out how to print. We were unable to get our vouchers.  Second, the maid was rude. We asked for additional towels. When she brought them to us she did not speak English and as a result barged into our room by pushing my friend out of the way to retrieve the old towels. I was still in bed. And by the way, it's not like anyone would ever take them since they are paper thin. Third, the night before we left we asked the front desk to confirm a car service to the airport which they",1,1
"Though the hotel investigated it, the air conditioning did not cool the room well enough for sleep. It only goes down to 18º C which is the upper limit of what sleep experts recommend. For the first two nights the air conditioning did not appear to be working but even on the third night, when something had been done to it, the temperature seemed the same.   So we opened the window and even during a hot spell cool air flooded in. This is quite an expensive double room at the back which should be quiet, and would be were it not for the constant whine of a machine of some kind -  probably the air condtioning! -which the hotel seemed unaware of, saying the no one else had complained about it. No staff offered to come and hear the noise which at night is quite penetrating and",2,1
"We stayed at the Pas de Calais for 7 nights, originally booked 10, but were unable to find another hotel because of high occupancy in the area.  This was our third stay and we had booked a deluxe room as we had been very happy with the highest category room in the past.  Sadly we were given a substandard room for that category - probably because we had booked a long stay and they gave us a harder to rent room.  The safe was inoperative, curtains starting to come off and continuing problems with the toilet. The staff had no interest in trying to move us and find something better.  We were extremely disappointed with the room and the staff attitude. Finally managed to find another hotel for our last 3 nights.  Do not ever plan to return to this hotel.",2,1
"Passed PM at hotel 3/10/14. Our second stay-it seems that it depends on one's luck in room allocation. Our earlier stay in late September 14 was much more enjoyable and comfortable, our current stay was not. Our room was small and the bed particularly uncomfortable. Breakfast and staff were of a high quality. When spending almost £200 for a night's stay, comfort should not be pot-luck! My advice, ask to view room before acceptance.",2,1
"The pictures on their site are not representative of their rooms. This is a 1 STAR hotel, at best. There are no services. No porter. No turn-down service. No Internet capability in rooms.  The petit dejuner is NOT included in the room charge, and is a major surprise for its quality. Smoke permeates the building as does the odor of disinfectant and DDT! A plus are the staff. They are pleasant and accommodating. Also, the location of the hotel is excellent. All in all, this was the worst hotel I have ever reserved in Paris.",1,1
"The cleaning lady or someone of the staff stole our stuff from our room. They were rude and they didn't care. It's outrageous! Everything about the hotel was a big disappointment. The rooms are small, noisy and smelly. The corridors and the elevator were dirty. The breakfast was poor and the same every day. It is like a bad dormitory. Disgusting!",1,1
"I have never been so disappointed with any service provider. We were forced to leave the hotel because of the US stopping domestic flights and France closing their borders. We had three nights including breakfast left and management won’t even give us a credit to use in November of this year. I REFUSE to stay here again because of this horrible customer service beyond anyone’s control.   Had they given us a credit I would have happily started here again despite the very small rooms, lack of hot water in the evenings, and mediocre breakfast. The staff was friendly but I cannot tolerate or stomach such greed - take your money elsewhere.",1,1
Don’t go to this hotel!!  This hotel treats guests like trash!! They are the worst hosts ever!! Never in my life I saw such lack of cordially!! I have no words to describe the arrogance of the staff!! It’s unreal really!! WORST HOTEL EVER!!!,1,1
My wife and I had visited Paris on 5 previous occasions and on this occasion we decided to find a new location. The cost of the room was a bit more expensive than past visits but we were happy to book based on the hotel location and photos displayed on the hotels own web site.   Unfortunately the only part of our stay we enjoyed was the hotels location.  Upon initial arrival we were taken by surprise to see that the exterior of the hotel bore no resemblance to the photo displayed on their own web site.   The second and most disappointing aspect was the size of the room. It was so small that we found it most uncomfortable.   Once again the room we thought we book based on the web site photo was way smaller than the impression given via the web site. Being experienced travellers,2,1
"This hotel is in a great location and I had high hopes based on other reviews. We cannot sleep or enjoy our stay here because the a/c is broken in our room and it is very hot i(we are on the 6th floor). . We specifically only booked hotels that had air conditioning as it is very warm here, so we are not receiving the value we paid for and we are too uncomfortable to sleep. The front desk staff was not apologetic at all and basically told us there was nothing they could do. Would definitely not recommend this hotel as there are many others that are in a good location AND care about the comfort of their guests!",1,1
"I've been away many times and have never written reviews...but feel compelled to do so on this place.  Arrived in the evening to check-in. The room was ok, nice lighting, small but pleasant, no iron or board.   Went downstairs to go out about 12.30am, front door was locked wouldn't open on the push button...this is strange, concierge again nowhere to be seen, but came after a few minutes of calling out.....what if there was a fire!!!!   Came back at 3.30am, front door was locked......conciergre showed up after a few minutes of rining the bell.....wtf.....not great service!!!  Anyway i'm tired and go to bed, than at about 6.30am woke up to what felt like someone shining a bright ligt in my face....sunlight coming through the curtain....curtain was fully closed but couldn't reach",1,1
"The hotel is less than 2-star in American standard. Very small room, worn out/dirty carpet.   The staff was very unprofessional, even to the point of being rude. When there was issue to be resolved, they didn't offer any help.",1,1
"Terrible, run down, we did not get the rooms shown in pics, we were stuffed in unsightly stalls, one without AC. In the end, as we were leaving, we were told by reception that next time we stay there (ha ha) they will give us good rooms. We should have called the police.",1,1
"Could not travel to Paris from London due to Nationwide strike in France and made immediate and multiple attempts to cancel reservation. Hotel refused to cancel and refund despite our inability to get to Paris through no fault of our own. Every other hotel, train and airline refunded except this hotel. Very disappointing!",1,1
"Hotel room is clean, nice beds, air doesn’t really cool like it should, WiFi at hotel works fine, their connection to make free calls or use WiFi outside the hotel and does not stream to the TV as advertised. Let me say about the staff has NO clue how to fix it. You can ask for assistance and the response is. Let me call the technician. The technician doesn’t show up or do they follow up. For the air. It does cool down the temp you can turn it too. Granted I’m not dying but cold showers are required.  They seem to have one person working the reception desk at a time. They are trying to do check in’s plus all the other Duties. Has the potential to be a top place to stay. Need a bit more staff to be working. The lady that works during the day did help us on directions and such. So",2,1
Stayed here for 3 nights. The room is super small even for paris standards. The worst is the bathroom. If you sit on the pot..there is not even enough space to fit your legs. The location is excellent. Staff is friendly. Air con was not working. The housekeeping staff told. If you feel hot. Open the windows. Now what kind of answer is that.,2,1
"My extended family had planned a first time vacation to Paris. We were going to and from different places. Orignally, I had booked a different, lower cost hotel with comparable amenities. However, the other hotel did not provide shuttle services to/from the airport.  At the suggestion of my family, I booked Hotel Magda since their website stated they will help arrange for shuttle service and we had already booked Hotel Magda for a return to Paris later in the week.   I had booked reservations for 3 deluxe suites and 1 junior suite. The cost of the 4 rooms was double that of my previous hotel reservation elsewhere. This was, after all, the first time we had been in Paris and not having to worry about transportation to the hotel was one less thing to worry about. So we booked this",1,1
I hate it. It’s terrible!!  Very very poor services.  Cleanliness is poor. Location is not bad. Sleep quality is horrible (noise from outside and inside the hotel) Rooms are veeeeeery small. After all it doesn’t worth the money!,1,1
"Rooms are much smaller than shown on internet.  Service was good however I felt the hotel could have pre-warned us before the trip that there were going to be full blown riots in the Center of Paris which were very unsettling, to the point the police using tear gas.  This riot prevented us getting a train back to the hotel on the day and meant we had to walk through the rioters as they burned down external coffee shops and smashed shop windows with bricks.  At the very least the hotel could have warned their guests in the morning asking them to avoid the champs eleysee during specific times.",2,1
"During the day or the night, You can hear everything that happens in the other rooms. Seems like walls are super thin! Otherwise very average experience. Did not try the breakfast and room was ok. Lot's of places around for breakfast or lunch",2,1
"I want to start off by saying that i love the location of this hotel. It is an easy 5 mins walk from the arc de triomphe and champs elysee.  However, two incidents left a particularly bad taste in my mouth and completely marred the experience at Royal Magda Etoile hotel. On 19 Dec, we came back to the hotel to find that our room door was left ajar, probably by the housekeeper (not sure if this was done on purpose, or just pure carelessnesss). We had been out for a good 8 hours or so at that point and it was really scary to think about who might have come into our room during this time. We had valuables kept in the room, including an ipad and over a thousand euros in cash. When we reported the incident to the receptionist on duty that evening, he was nonchalant and not the least",2,1
"It has been 2 years since I have written a review on Tripadvisor. I guess I have to be affected enough to spend my time writing one and boy, am I affected by this hotel. Affected...ha! That's putting it mildly.   For starters, let me say we did not stay and will not be staying at this hotel.   We wanted to book a room here for 2 reasons. 1) It's location and 2) It claims to have facilities and a room for people with disabilities. As hotels are not always clear on the 2nd issue, we contacted them to make sure we got it all right. Obviously, getting it wrong can be a pretty major problem.   In the hotels first reply (which took 2 days), they said, ""We would have been delighted to welcome you but unfortunately the hotel is not adapted for guests with wheelchair, we are working to",1,1
"We have stayed at this Paris hotel at least 3 times in the last 4 years, and will not be going back.  While the service was very friendly, and the lobby nice, the room was very tired and loud.  Paint was pealing off the ceiling and the room looked run down.   Like some hotels that get hot from trip advisor ratings, I think this hotel is resting on its laurels.",2,1
"I am currently staying here.   Today is 2 October 2013.  Ac did not work in room 312.  Was told it is not the ac unit...it was us, but rather that we were just not used to french ac???   Really???   Well we also have room 615 and that ac works fine.   So they lie to tourists.   Safe got jammed.....called front desk in evening.   Was told I had to wait to am for a tech.    Told them my medicine was in there....amazingly they showed up with a key to open.   However, its still jammed.   No tech ever fixed the safe.   So again....a lie???  Coffee cup was cracked....poured soda in it so they would replace with new/clean....nope...they just ""washed"" it out and put it back.   Cracked cup still in room!!!  Has anyone elae been in 312 and remember a cracked cup??  Wonder how long it has",2,1
"This hotel was recommended and along with reviews booked 2 nights. Had to wait 3 hours for our room to be ready. Room was tiny, nowhere to put 2  suitcases. Room was hot and stuffy and air-conditioner didn't work. We were given room on 3rd floor facing street. All night noise from club across from hotel made sleep impossible Beds hard. Bathroom tiny. Next day had to wait till 4.30 pm for our room to be cleaned. Had been out all day so had to just sit and wait.  Coffee cups in room were dirty from previous occupant, requested twice for new ones to bought up. We had transferred from another larger chain hotel in Paris and were looking forward to a small boutique one. Very disappointed with service.",2,1
"Great location, but there are plenty of other hotels nearby, free WIFI, the room was tiny but cosy and very clean. It has a minibar, which is not always the case in this type of French hotels.  BUT:  1. the TV was not working and it took them an hour of trials and errors, bringing in and out several TV sets and remote controls to finally fix it. The guy apologised so many times that I was willing to forget it.  2. I ordered room service from their very extensive menu and was told it would be max 25 minutes. After an hour (by the time they finished fixing my TV), I called again. ""normally, it should arrive soon"". Long story short, it never did, the staff was absolutely unhelpful and I had to go out for a later dinner.  3. The elevator in the meantime was out of order at the time",2,1
"Two friends and I stayed at the Royal Magda for several days mid-May 2012.  We had been in Sierra Leone, West Africa before traveling to Paris. We needed some clothes cleaned and gave them to the hotel for cleaning. I had a very expensive linen blouse that had gotten something all over it while I was in Africa and I had no idea what it was. I asked the hotel to pay particular attention to the areas that needed it. The shirt was returned, pressed, but not cleaned. When I got home, I used a cheap stain remover on the blouse and washed it in my washing machine. The spots came out with no trace remaining. Obviously the hotel did not attempt to clean the blouse, but they did iron it. I was charged for a cleaning I did not get. Other than that, the hotel was fine with a particularly",2,1
"Seriously.  I don't mean to be rude but c'mon TA reviewers what are you thinking?  A TA choice award winner?!  This place was old, dated and dingy.  It was literally like a hostel except you got your own room.  You had to use a key (not a card) to open the extremely old, flimsy door.  And we could hear every single noise that our neighboring rooms made.  The carpet was old and dingy as was the bathroom.  The only reason I am giving it a two because the bed was actually comfortable (but I did just get off a ten hour red eye) and there were no hairs on sheets or towels (surprisingly hard to find these days) and the staff was friendly.  And yes, this is close to the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs but so what?  You look at the arc for like 5 minutes and the Champs is a gross",2,1
"VERY DISAPPOINTED!!  I booked this hotel based upon the positive reviews on Tripadvisor.  It was quite the contrary. This hotel was similar to a hostel, we were very disappointed.   TripAdvisor got it wrong!  * CHECKIN: We entered the hotel lobby the receptionist said ""Bonjour, what is your last name"" and that was it.  She then showed us to the lift and said ""you are on 5"". I am not big on small talk but I was at least expecting a briefing on the hotel, breakfast, wifi, etc but that did not happen. We were not informed of any of that.    * THE ROOM (First Impression): After reaching our room, I thought I may have booked the wrong hotel, so I double checked from my iPhone, yes this is the same place: Royal Magda Etoile, 7 Rue Troyon, Paris.  The room had a very bad, very strong",1,1
"Booked this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews, however now am really puzzled why the reviews are so good! Yes, the hotel is only a 5 min walk from metro. Yes, the staff is friendly. Yes, the bed is firm and comfortable. Yes, the colour scheme is very nice. But the walls are not sound-proof, so you hear what's happening on the floor. Windows face the street, and there is a night club nearby. You can't get a stable flow of hot water at 8 am. The rooms are relatively clean, but the furniture and fixings are too old. In my opinion, a substantial renovation is required. We did not have breakfast after having seen what was on offer (nothing). Overall, not impressive. Particularly for that price.",2,1
"Stayed in March 2008, easter weekend. The first day there, we locked our credit cards in the in-room safe and set the code. I used the safe about 3 times before we left that morning. When we came back at night, my code didnt work and I couldnt open the safe. It was about 8 pm and the man at the front desk said he was the only one working so he could not have someone come up to fix it and open the safe until the next morning. At 8 am, I called downstairs to see if they could send someone up to fix the safe, and guess who they sent? A MAID....yes the same one who cleans our room during the day! the maids have the ultimate access code to the safe, and she opened it, but from then on, it was disabled for the rest of our trip and non-functional. The cards were still in there BUT the",1,1
"I read reviews and am fairly adept at determing when people are overly complimentary or negative. Wow...did I miss it here. It was merely an adequate boutique hotel in a fabulous location. We have stayed in Paris several times and were specifically looking for a hotel near the Arch D'Triumphe. I e-mailed with the hotel and was assured that our upgraded room would be ""large""...we could barely put our luggage in the room and no room to move around. We upgrade to a junior suite that was laughable. The furniture appeared to have been bought at a yard sale. There are numerous 3* hotels in all the surrounding streets to select from. The breakfast was expensive, 12euro per person for a continental breakfast.  Yohan who seems to have his own fan club is typically officious French. We",2,1
"Have just returned from spending 3 nights at Royal Magda ,I cannot help wondering if I stayed in the same hotel as some of the other reviewers!  I booked this hotel because of all the positive reviews I read on Tripadvisor but my experience has left me somewh\t perplexed!  Yes the hotel is spotlessly clean and the location is perfect but the Reception Staff ( Flore in particular) could not have been more unfriendly and unhelpful.  The cleaning staff and breakfast staff were very friendly and polite and the gentleman on the reception desk at night was very helpful and obliging.  The first problem arose when I asked Flore if she could suggest a restauramnt in the Pont Neuf area as we were gong on the Seine Cruise that evening and it departed from that area.  I was amazed when her",2,1
after reading the reviews I booked this hotel for 126 euros on travelocity.  When I got my confirmation email from travelocity I found out I would be charged an extra 24 euros for breakfast regardless if I wanted it or not...cancelled the reservations,2,1
"This place was OK, the room was very small, but Im sure most are. the location was good, close to the Arc, but next time we will stay somewhere by Avenue St Germain, much more going on and a livlier atmosphere. The people at the hotel were no where near as friendly or helpful as some people on this site have claimed. They wouldnt call us a taxi to take us to the airport, we needed a replacement credit card sent to the hotel but when the company called they told them we didnt have a reservation, we obviously did and had to re order the card and got it on the last day, thanks guys for being on the ball! they charged us for a breakfast we didnt have. Very over rated, not sure why this so many people think this place is so great.",2,1
"We stayed here for three nights and booked it based on TripAdvisor reviews.  We loved the location.   Very convenient to just about anything you want to do in Paris.  The rooms are clean and the hotel itself is nice.  I agree with some of the users regarding how loud the hotel is.  Anytime anyone flushed a toilet on a floor above us, we could hear the water rushing through the pipes in our room and anyone walking or talking in the hall could be heard very clearly.  Noise in any hotel is to be expected but why I rated this hotel so low is the loud neighbors.  There is some sort of private club next door and every night between 12:00-1:00am there was incredibly loud music and cheering.  Not fun to be startled out of a sound sleep every night.  Ear plugs would not even keep out",2,1
"I must say this hotel was quite a disappointment compared to the accolades received on tripadvisor. There was no help with the luggage to the room, elevator was tiny, and could fit one person and one piece of luggage. My room was so small, I could barely move around. The shower stall was also very small.  The location was out of the way for all my activities.  I was just totally disappointed with the whole experience. I would never stay at this hotel again.  The only positive thing about the hotel was the air conditioning, it worked and it was adapted to each room.",2,1
We booked the Royal Magda Etolie based on the excellent reviews that are posted on tripadvisor and so it is only right that I share a negative experience about this hotel.   We booked our room months in advance and on the way to the airport I received a phone call from the hotel to say they had double booked our room and would move to a nearby hotel as it was easier to move a young couple than a family. To be fair they were very helpful we stayed a few streets away in thepleasant  Hotel Balmoral and made up the difference in the room rate per night and offered us complimentary breakfast at the Magda Etoile. We had a great trip to Paris all considered but would have preferred not to have lost the first hour of our holiday being relocated and stressing on the plane about where we,2,1
"Six months ago we stayed at the Hotel Splendid Etoile in Paris based on the rating and reviews on the Trip Advisor web site. The hotel was better than the reviews.  In planning another trip to Paris (Dec, 06), I consulted Trip Advisor to find a better rating for the Royal Magda Etoile. Although the room was clean, spacious and adequate, it was no more.  The elevator was barely large enough for two adults WITHOUT LUGGAGE. The room had to be locked going in and out with a key, minor but  a nuicance. There were no washcloths in the bathroom and none available. Closet space was minimal and there were no drawers. The furnishings and decor was quite basic. The internet connection was hit and miss, mostly miss. Ther was no full length mirror in the room. The windows all faced a small",2,1
"After reading all the reviews on trip advisor, I decided to book a room for 1 night at the Royal Magda, it was highly recommended!  No one could fault it!  I was really looking forward to spend my husbands 40th in the romantic city until we arrived at the hotel.  We were told by the man at reception there had been a problem with the guests not vacating our room in time due to a family member falling ill and being treated at the hospital.  We offered to return later on in the afternnoon but was told it still might not be available.  At that point my heart just sank!  You can imagine how  my husband was feeling.  They had already arranged to put us in another hotel nearby, the Hotel Mac Mahon.  I don't think they realise why we booked the room with them!  If I wanted to book a",1,1
"Starting at the arrival,  we had a room in the 4th floor and the Hotel elevator was broken,  the second day the door knob broke and got scrambled the digital system and no one in the Hotel were able to open the door.   I was paying above 300 Euros per night in a hotel that does not not worth 50 euros per night",1,1
"First of all, the name should not mislead you. This hotel is not on the Champs Elysees although it is close by. I arrived in the late evening and I was welcomed by a very friendly receptionist. She completed the check in process very fast and I was heading to my room. My first shock was at the elevator. It was almost impossible for two persons to squeeze into the elevator without touching each other. That was helpful to manage my expectations before entering my room which turned out to be also very tiny. There was almost no space even to open my luggage. Otherwise, the room was very clean and tidy.  At night it was relatively cold. I turned on the heating system. But there was a noise like a steam engine working. Hence I switched off the heating system in order to have a",2,1
"We recently stayed four nights at this very mediocre hotel. The only positive was its location to the subway and to the Champs Elysees. However, I would never recommend this hotel. Check in took a long time. The clerk was dishonest about how much breakfast cost. He quoted us a figure. When we said we weren't interested he lowered the price slightly. The one morning I did pay for breakfast (20 euro), I was very disappointed in the quality and the selection. Our room was very tiny. It was also very hot so we had to sleep with both windows open. The bed was very hard, as were the pillows, so I barely slept. The furniture was old and beaten up. The coffeemaker didn't work properly and had instant coffee. The bathroom was cramped with no air flow. Not even the toiletries smelled",1,1
Spent 2 nights here and first impression was that the front of house staff were attentive and accomodating. The room was comfortable and had shutters on the outside to keep the light out and double glazing making it dark and quiet at night. Unfortunately it was downhill from here.   The weather was hot and aircon essential. On turning it on to the lowest speed it was so noisy you couldn’t hear the tv let alone sleep with it on - then it began leaking water requiring towels underneath.  Maintenance came and said nothing could be done until a weekday as no one works on weekends. (No suggestion of room change)  On Monday the leak was fixed but not the noise so had to sleep in a hot stuffy room.  Then the hairdryer on the wall only works in 5 second intervals before it cuts out.,2,1
"Before I write this review, just want to BEWARE you that as told by their reception staff, they DO NOT have Queen or King beds for their Premium category rooms......... So if you plan on staying here with your spouse/partner, be prepared to sleep on 2 Twin beds joined together, otherwise they’ll ask you 120 Euro for upgrading to a junior suite. Remember, all this for a Queen bed!  Have just checked in here about an hour back and already too frustrated at the attitude of their front desk staff!",1,1
"I stayed a couple of days in this hotel and was quite disappointed. One day, they forgot to do my room and I had to request them to do it when back in the evening. Fortunately they were reactive enough to do it. But the most incredible thing is what happened with the taxi when I checked out. When I checked out at 7am, I order at the reception a taxi to go to the airport. The receptionist called and told me that the taxi should be there in 7 minutes which was OK with me. There were another customer waiting for a taxi which was ordered before who was also waiting. When the taxi arrived, the driver gave a a € note in a discrete manner to the receptionist. In France, taxi drivers are not supposed to bribe receptionist to get a taxi. Then, the phone rang and the receptionist told me",2,1
"I carefully read the many wonderful reviews and high ratings. I also viewed the many photos listed online that showed rooms of generous size.   The one positive note on this property is that is is located on a beautiful street and within very close proximity to many key attractions and shopping.  I have also stayed at several other Melia properties in the Caribbean.  My experience here was very different than any before.  I rated this hotel 2 stars only because the staff was excellent.  However, the hotel itself is really a 2 star property, at best.  First, the photos depict large rooms that have modern decor. In reality the room decor is very dated and the carpet covered flooring needs to be vacuumed cleaned much better.  The room barely fits two people. However, there is only",2,1
"I arrived with a work colleague who, when we checked in was given a corporate room rate very different from mine 185€ vs 270€.  When I pointed out the error, they refused to adjust the rate and blamed it on the travel agency.  On top, to add insult to injury the lower room rate was a larger room.    I've checked online tonight and the rates are still lower had I canceled and rebooked.  This is simply dishonest management and I cannot recommend a hotel that does not honor business deals made with a company.",1,1

"It is the first time I am disapointed by a Melia hotel. It is old, not well maintained and the rooms are very small. It has ""Champs Elysées"" in its name but it is actually quiete far from the famous avenue.",2,1
"This hotel is without doubt well-situated if you want to visit Paris and the principal atractions as the Eiffel tower, champs elysees, arc of triomph, etc.  Nevertheless and being aware about how expensive are hotels in paris it was simply ridiculous the amount of money you have to pay for a room with the size of a wardrobe. Probably the should have built less rooms but with more space, or buy a bigger building, the entire building is quite small, you have to be aware where is the hotel, otherwise you can miss it. The staff was nice and of course the standards of the hotel in terms of amability and cleaning were high due to the fame an internationalism of the brand Melia. If you can choose another hotel for less take it, for sure the size of the room at least would allow you to",2,1
"I had very high hopes for this hotel and quality of the room was actually very nice. However, I chose this hotel for the sole purpose of getting a room with a supplemental (""roll-away"") bed inside my room as there were 3 of us staying there. Not only did the staff not insert the bed I requested but they also refused remedy the situation no matter hard I tried, they kept on saying that all the rooms capable of housing extra beds were occupied even though my invoice clearly stated that I paid extra for the supplemental bed. After much confused arguing and waiting, I finally gave up and booked another hotel elsewhere in the city. I will unfortunately be contacting Expedia for a refund on this hotel. Which is too bad because I enjoyed the room itself and the location but the staff's",2,1
Arrived to find  we hadn't booked the room we thought we had it was very small and dark so we paid for an upgrade and it wasn't much better. We were ignored in the tiny breakfast room on the first morning and the so called hot breakfast was stone cold. There was no atmosphere in the hotel at all. All in all it is very overpriced and poor value for money. We have stayed in this hotel chain on several occasions and never had one complaint. After two days we left and checked in somewhere else.,1,1
"We stayed here for 3 nites....the room photos do not reflect the room we were in......barely enough room for our suitcases and the bathroom quite frankly a joke....for the rate we paid despite a great location, we were not comfortable.  A good breakfast and friendly waiting staff - yes.....I believe there is better value to be found.  We would not recommend this hotel unless you opt for a superior/deluxe room.",2,1
"The hotel itself is nice. The room is clean and staff friendly. However I booked my reservations online with the option to pay at the hotel and cancellation up to the day before arrival. Two days before arriving, the hotel charged the entire stay to my credit card contrary to the conditions of reservation. They also charged the entire party (3 rooms) to my card even as we planned to each pay for our own room (for accounting). The worst is that at the hotel, I asked for an invoice for the payment already made and the hotel clerk could not provide it. He promised to send it by email and I never heard from the hotel. They also failed to provide me with a copy of the shuttle bus invoice. So I am left with an accounting mess that is still not resolved. Just for this reason, I will",2,1
"I stayed 3 nighs and complained about the very cold shower water after the first night. The hotelstaff said that it would be looked at, but the following 2 mornings was the same. I don't care about a little cold water, but this was icecold and not possible to use at all. I talked to a manager at check out who was sorry, but no compensation or anything was offered. The hotel is clean and nice, but this pulls them down low level. I feel that I paid full price for a broken product.",2,1
"This hotel used to be an independent one and it was a charming, well-run, intimate hotel.  Wow, has it declined!  I arranged for a taxi from the hotel to pick me up from the airport - they sent it to the wrong airport and it never showed up.  Mistakes happen, but it was a mad scramble as to which staff member could more effectively blame the problem on another (lots of eye rolls about colleagues and ""It never happens, madam!"").   We had just flown in from the states and asked to be told when our room was ready - they forgot to.   Really?  With an 8 and a 9 year-old who haven't slept?

After switching us to a non-smoking room, we found out the safe in that room doesn't work, and the technician doesn't come in till 9:30AM, it was around 7PM at the time. Given we only had 2 days in Paris, we're not sitting around waiting for a technician, we left our valuables with the hotel's safe and was assured the safe would be fixed when we returned.

"My husband and I travelled to Paris for a weekend.  We booked the Melia Alexander and asked for a room with a king bed or 2 double beds.  When we arrived they tried to up-sell us to a larger room for 30 euro/night.  Our room was a little bigger than a broom closet. We barely had room to walk around our DOUBLE bed! The airconditioning had no thermostat, it was either ON or OFF.  The mattress was like a piece of cardboard! Poor and unprofessional front desk personnel. When we left they charged us 10 euro for the 'city VAT' fee whatever that is.  We've travelled extensively in Europe and have never paid this.  Then they charged 1 euro for UNICEF...I thought donations to charities are optional.    In short, the only good thing about this hotel is the location!  We would never stay",2,1
We stayed at Melia in early July for 4 nights.  Rooms were tiny but that is not my major complaint.  My complaint was that they over billed us $15 Euros for internet access we did not use.  Brought this up to management but they would not credit us for this over billing.  We'll need to contact our bank to get this resolved.  Horrible customer service.  So be careful about staying at this place.,2,1

At check-in time, we were told that the room we booked from Priceline was no good. It was their policy that we had to upgrade to a bigger room since there were 3 people, no matter how old my daughter was (the exact words were, even if she was months old).  So we were forced to upgrade to a ""bigger"" room with an extra 60 euros per day. The so-called ""bigger"" room was the smallest hotel room I ever stayed.  Upgrading to a ""bigger"" room only allowed them to add a folding bed. I told them I didn't need a folding bed. A king-size bed would sleep 3 of us comfortably. But once again, I was told this was their policy. They have to add a folding",1,1

I have never wrote a negative review about any hotel or restaurant before this one .  There is nothing 4 star about this hotel, it is impossible to get a decent nights sleep in this hotel.  I don't care about amenities, this hotel has none by the way.

When you ask why not, they blame you not call and tell them. Hotel has a lobby that can barely fit 15 people in it. Night shift staff was always an older gentleman who was very slow and hesitated to do anything we asked for. This older Indian gentleman who worked at nights during my stay always said he was the only one working there, if we needed anything, we should wait till the next morning.

To keep this short and to the point...my boyfriend and I had our room broken into---via a hole drilled right underneath the door handle---and had thousands upon thousands of dollars worth of our personal belongings stolen. This included a laptop, camera, handbags, clothing, etc. Now, being a ""4 star"" hotel, one would expect there to be security cameras, or at least A security camera...however, there were NONE. To this day, I'm convinced that this was all an inside job...the front desk clerk asked and knew enough to get the job done!

"I stayed at the Alexander two times on work trips, most recently in October 2007.  In my view, the hotel is overpriced and stuffy, without many amenities. The rooms are extremely small even by European standards - I am a petite woman and I had a hard time fitting into the bathroom!  Moreover, the location, while close to the meetings I attended, and some high-end shopping on the Avenue Victor Hugo (and an admittedly good patisserie and fromagerie) is very residential, and does not have any interesting sites or a vibrant streetlife. But the worst part is that I brought home (unknowingly) bed bugs from my October 2007 stay.  Although, based on what I now know about bed bugs, the Alexander was not necessarily at fault (it only takes one traveler to bring them into a room and they",1,1
We booked a weekend with some friends based on the hotel website description of a 'boutique hotel' and 'recently refurbished'.  I would disagree with both these. On enquiring with the reception it was at least 6 years since the hotel was refurbished - and it showed.  Dreary rooms and dated somewhat scruffy bathrooms. although ours was quiet at the back of the hotel. public areas are very average.  We did not try the breakfast which we felt was expensive at €25.  Staff were helpful and friendly enough. Location suited us - quieter than some but a good quality area. Overall it was certainly poor value for money - we felt cheated on the price given the poor quality.  We will not return.,2,1
"Awful in any sense of the word. I have visited a number of Melia Hotels both in business trips and for leisure, and without no doubt, this is the worst of them all. It wasn’t exactly my preference choice, as I plan the trip very short in advance, being the only available for my required dates. Saying so, it is selling as a “beautiful, boutique hotel, centrally located” None of the above turned to be true. I have a superior room. Huge, but decorated in such a way that you feel lost and sad. Lighting was terrible, even with all lamps switched on you rather are able to read the paper. Old-fashioned, badly maintenance pieces of furniture, tacky bed linen and curtains, seventy’s style bathroom, dirty fitted carpet. Elevator was so narrow; there is only space for 1 person and 1 piece",1,1
From start to finish this the worst hotel I have ever been in.  The staff was extremely rude and unhelpful.  The rooms were not kept up well and the so called air condition never worker properly.  I am sure there are much better hotels in the area for the same price.  If you are planning a trip to Paris do not stay at this hotel.,1,1
"The hotel Alexander had an attractive reception area. It was boutique style and had a cute sitting room with newspapers etc. The room was a good size and the bathroom was good too. The carpet and furniture were tired though and the furniture wasnt 'antique'. THe room temperature was cold and the bedding was minimal, we requested a double bed but got two singles placed together, which wasnt ideal. Breakfast at 25 euro was a rip off.  The staff were professional and polite although not friendly. Overall, I do not think that the price reflects the quality of the hotel and I conclude by saying that this is not a good value for money option.",2,1
"I have been in Melia Alexander the past weekend. The Hotel is well situated but the service and the rooms are very poor. The ""Check in"" was a nightmare, the staff didn´t find our reservation, after they didn´t know the price... was terrible,   The rooms are very small, the bathroom smaller, and the elevator for 2 people only...  And, all this after we pay 225 € without breakfast.   Never again...",2,1
We stayed with Hotel Marignan for 6 nights. We are a family of 5 with 3 teenagers. The rooms had One full size bed and 3 twin beds. We stayed 3 nights in room 14 which was on the 3rd floor. We were moved from that room to a room on the 1st floor which was larger for the last 3 nights. During our stay on the 1st floor we had guys that kept knocking on the door wanting to come in and paint. We left around 5 am to catch the Eurostar back to London when I realized my North Face jacket was missing. Last I had seen it was when I laid it on top of my luggage when it on the 3rd floor (they transferred our luggage for us). The Hotel wasn’t open yet when we left so I have sent them multiple emails asking if they have seen my jacket. They have not responded to any of my messages. The only,2,1
"The man who seems to be in charge of breakfast is incredibly rude to the customers and the staff. He yelled at a girl who was very sweet and helpful to us for 5 minutes straight. Very uncomfortable. Other than that, great hotel.",1,1
"I came here with my wife on a two days trip in Paris; we booked it on the internet thanks to the affordable price. Our room was on the 6th (and last) floor, with no available elevator!  It obviously wasn't ready when we get there (check-in time around midday, we arrived at 1.30 pm), as it was unclean and some wires were exposed (!!!), there were no bed sheet and there was no toilet paper inside the little bathroom.   We choose this place for the price, but the quality was missing.",1,1
"You don't go to Paris to sleep but to immerse yourself in the old world architecture, fine art, delicious cuisine, sultry wines and general allure of the French culture. That being said, one does need a comfortable spot to rest and recharge for the next days adventure. The Hotel Marignan is NOT such a place!  This antiquated inn is beyond out-dated, featuring the tiniest of rooms, no ""lift"" (elevator) or even air conditioning. Our minuscule room was located on the sixth floor, which was actually the seventh due to the ground floor being considered floor ""0"", and without an elevator, we were required to carry our luggage up a seemingly endless spiraling, claustrophobic staircase resulting in burning leg muscles, pounding hearts and lungs gasping for air. The space was far too",1,1
"My adult grandson and I (74 year old male) had a second floor room that was clean and okay.  The common areas were not clean and obviously neglected. The female desk person was nice, friendly and helpful. The man, maybe manager, was terse and unpleasant, as was the breakfast staff. The location is very good and we felt safe there, although unwelcome. It is more like a youth hostel than regular guest hotel. The three days and two nights spent there did not give a good impression of the area.",2,1
"I stayed here with a friend in the fall & it was great. My friend had never stayed anywhere with the shower down the hall, but it was fine. One concern was that there was nowhere to hang your clothes or towel while in the shower area… not very accommodating. I also had a problem with the breakfast hostess… my friend knew that I needed my caffeine first thing in the morning or I get a little cranky… so she asked the woman if I could have some coffee before breakfast started. The woman just glared & didn't give us any coffee. Then when it came time for breakfast, the woman brought my friend a full breakfast & only brought me COFFEE! No food, just coffee! Seriously? I wasn't even the one who asked for the favor, yet I was the one that was punished. It took until the 3rd morning",2,1
"We were supposed to stay there for 4 nights. Had very bad experience in the first night - bedbugs bit my spouse and me everywhere. Woke up in the midnight. Found and killed quite a few on the bed with blood in the bug. Talked to the hotel guy, replaced all the bed sheets and blankets. It DIDN'T help. Bedbugs still bit us. We had 20+ bites on our bodies. We didn't really sleep for the whole night. Even worse, the hotel manager didn't admit they had this kind of problems before and claimed we probably brought the bedbugs from other places. What a joke! We have been traveling around the world for 20+ years and this was the first time in my life to be bothered by bedbugs. Even for this trip, we traveled for 4 countries in Europe and that was the only time we had the problem. We left",1,1
"It is good location to visit hot point of  paris. But facility and attitude of manager and steep stairs to 6th floor (theres no lift) with luggage , broken door of bathroom, No soundproof room make me disappointed. I wont recommend it",2,1
"Hotel Marignon is situated in a good location, quiet street and has a staff with good English skills.  The beds were comfortable, and the rooms clean and looked nice.  If you don't mind an occasional sticky breakfast tray or table, the breakfast was fine considering what you normally get in Europe.  Our room was at the end of the hall on the 1st floor (really the 2nd floor).  I give the location because it is important not to get this room.  The plumbing happens to be connected to an un-vented sanitary stack.  What this means is that when a toilet above you is flushed, the gas pressure in the stack from the falling waste causes the floor traps (there are two) to gurgle and let sewage gas through into the bathroom.  Eventually, the traps are ""sucked"" dry, allowing the sewage gas",1,1
"I really wanted to like this hotel. It was the last city of our 10 day European tour and I can with all honestly say this hotel ranks at the bottom. My son called it a dump, while I tried to explain it's a small French hotel in a modest price range I didn't buy it myself. The positives : most of the staff was nice. (though I agree the older lady is brash and went as far as coughing on my breakfast tray the first morning.). The location is great, the hotel is mostly very quiet, even when there was 'music night' all over the Latin Qtr we didn't hear any of the bands inside the hotel. The beds were comfortable enough. I was glad to have a free breakfast to start the day, the baguettes were nice, along with the marmalade (though I find fault with the canned fruit-and no real",2,1
"Apart from its location everything else was horrible. We stayed for two nights. TOTAL NIGHTMARES. The staffs were really rude, the rooms were small and were not in good condition. The breakfast was horrible. It was cold, flat, tasteless and ya HOrrible. They do not provide you with an electric kettle and so you need to go all the way down to the kitchen to get it. There were a few times when we were trying to get some hot water from the kitchen and the staffs (an old lady and a middle-aged man) scolded us in French. And there was once in the morning, the boss nearly quarreled with a lady. I mean, HOW COULD YOU be rude to your customers. Just a tip though, try speaking them in french before speaking in English, those people might be nicer to you if you try. Oh ya, there is no",1,1
we where in four people (2 adults and 2 children). There was no space in the room. The double bed was small. No space between beds. No space for baggage. Dirty. No elevator.  Breakfast not good. I suggest not to came here. The position is good.,1,1
"Pontos negativos: não limpam o quadro, não tem elevador, servem primeiro os americanos, a cozinha e velha e deixa a desejar na higiene. Ponto positivo: localização!!! Localização central, rua tranquila e próxima a diversos transportes. They don´t clean the room. They don´t have lift, The blond women serve the men before the other guests. If you are alone whith your kids, you are in a bad situation. The only good point is the location!",2,1
"Unfortunately I cannot give this hotel a positive review: I made a reservation online through the website of the hotel and my reservation was confirmed and secured with my credit card. When we arrived however, we were told that our room was not available: a large group had arrived and the hotel needed our room for them. We were offered a room in a different hotel (Hotel Studia) just around the corner. This hotel is on the Boulevard St. Germain: a very very noisy road with cars speeding by day and night, so we had to buy ear plugs to be able to get some sleep. One of the main reasons for choosing the Marignan was for the fact that the Rue du Sommerard is a nice quiet backstreet, so we were not exactly offered a likewise alternative. I find it very strange that a reservation,",1,1
"Although the hotel is in a lovely neighborhood close to many of Paris's most famous sites (Notre Dame is just a few blocks away), that is the only reason to stay in this place.  The manager of the hotel is nothing short of crazy (I've never met a more disagreeable, pushy, greedy and disrespectful person in my years of traveling), and the rooms are very cramped, even by Paris standards.  They shut the hot water for showers off at 10:30 every night, so don't plan on taking a hot shower if you come in after dinner/show/bar.  If you do not plan to be in your room at all during your stay in Paris, then this is a fine hotel for you.  My advice: avoid.",1,1
I strongly suggest NOT to stay in Hotel Marignan. My wife and I stayed there for 5 nights and we had a horrible experience.   1. Paul (the owner) and his daughter (manager) have a cold attitude and we did not like that at all. 2. Rooms are not well maintained and smells. 3. Bathrooms have a horrible smell too. 4. They have a free common kitchen in the ground floor and the complete hotel fill up with stench after around 5:30PM when people start cooking their favorite food in the kitchen. This was unbearable and a daily ordeal. I hate even recalling those evenings! 5. Breakfast is very minimal in quantity and items. And you get the exact same stuff every morning. 6. 'Weird' guests. Mostly poor families. One example: Every night we kept hearing this lady hitting her son and banging,2,1
"We stayed in this hotel and the hotel grands ecoles. With breakfast the difference would be about 150 euros for that and 120 for this. As we didn't pay the eight euros for breakfast at the other one the price difference was only €20. What a difference. That hotel has its own garden and huge, spacious rooms. But this hotel is like a youth hostel, with signs everywhere, some shared bathrooms and terrible rooms.The taps squirt lukewarm water, somewhat similar to the coffee, and the free wifi and location do little to redeem it. A 1-star hotel at a 4-star price. Avoid",2,1
"We stayed at this hotel while travelling to Paris, read the reviews before but did not expect what we received. When we first got there, there was a mix up with our reservation, we were supposed to be on the 6th floor with our own bathroom and got moved to the third floor and had to share a shower.  Its not a shower, more a wet room...need sandals to shower in! The stair cases up to the rooms are a killer...good thing we weren't on the 6th floor, I could only imagine. We found out the door to our room didn't lock and when notifying the front staff, was advised ""just don't keep anything valuable in there"".....we demanded it be fixed and came back to tape on the lock. There are also no pillow cases for the beds.  Yes you do get free breakfast but the quality of the food is not",1,1
"When we booked for one night (back in Paris to get a connecting flight) we were warned that this is an old building and there were only stairs and that we might have to share a bathroom.  What they didn't say was that it might be SIX flights up to our room and we would have to carry our luggage. The woman on reception was apologetic but unwavering about finding us another room - her suggestion was that we leave our luggage downstairs. I don't think so.  Our room was OK - what I would describe as good backpacker standard, with built-in bed and furnishings from the 1960/70s. Our double bed had one of those old-style sausage pillows.  There was no aircon, but we had a nice view north towards the river (thank goodness - so no afternoon sun to heat it up during a VERY hot and humid",2,1
"This was my second time in Paris this year.  The first time around, my husband and I stayed in a Best Western at about the same price further away from the sights.  Although this hotel is close to Notre Dame and the nearby sights, you still end up riding the metro most of the time.  Since riding the metro takes forever no matter where you are, you may as well stay somewhere nicer and just spend a few more minutes on the metro...    About the hotel - no elevator and we were on the 6th floor with a very heavy suitcase.  My sister and I lugged the suitcase up the spiral staircase avoiding the walls because there were painters working everywhere.  So, that being said, the hallways are a disaster.  Our room was decently clean but was ugly as hell.  We did find some nasty hairs under",2,1
Stayed at this hotel (dump) the staff were rude the hotel is run down and should be demolished as for the free breakfast (so is bacteria) i wouldn't eat there and some pillow case's would have been nice so at least i could have swatted the flies away,1,1
"The woman at the front desk is as meanspirited, rude, and insulting as they come.  Yes, the price is cheap (but in terms of accomodations you get what you pay for) and the location is great, but a guest in this hotel should not have to put up with with this kind of hostile treatment at any price. A dog would be treated with more respect in most situations.",1,1
"This is a 1-STAR, shabby, delapidated, run-down hotel with no A/C, elevator & most rooms facing the road. I booked, arrived there & subsequently checked-out immediately. Owner wanted 130 Euros (i.e. 1 night stay) since apparently, no penalty is incurred if you cancel > 30 days prior to arrival !! I gave hin 65 Euros. Hotel should be demolished and re-built.  We ended staying at the Best Western 2 doors down. Completely refurbished, fantastic, great staff.",1,1
"To be fair, I was with a group of friends traveling over the summer, and this just is not the place to say to do that. Most of the guests are families who ate all their meals in the bleak dining room...at 5 PM. I was talking on my cellphone outside the hotel around just before midnight and an obnoxious American woman came downstairs in her nightgown to call me an idiot for waking her up. Not a sound eurotrip choice, basically. The location is alright, as there are a lot of cafes in the area and you are right across the river from the Marais which is fun. But don't stay here if you're young and looking to have a good time.",2,1
"Had a terrible experience at the Hotel Marignan. We had booked five nights at this hotel. We were suposed to get to the hotel very early in the morning, after a night on a bus from Amsterdam. When we got there, we were exhausted of course, but, to our surprise, the lady at the reception desk told us that, even though we had made reservations, there were no rooms for us for the first night. She didn't even apologize for the mistake she'd made. She told us she would arrange our stay for one night at another hotel close by. Our luggage was VERY heavy and this hotel has no elevator, which is fine, we already knew that beforehand. But staying in two different hotels meant having to carry our luggage twice, which did not work for us. Luckly, we knew a very nice hotel also in the",1,1
"Let's start with the good, and there was a lot of good: -the location is great, a short walk from Notre Dame and very close to two metro stations. - the staff were pleasant and helpful (and their willingness to speak English was much appreciated as my French is extremely limited). - free breakfast - free laundry (this was great for us)  The bad: - no working toilet on our floor for the two nights of our stay (only a minor inconvenience, just ran up the stairs to the next floor) - THE NOISE. This is the deal breaker for me, the walls are paper thin and everything sounds like it's happening right next to you. There was a family in the room next to us, and they yelled at their kid, a lot, starting early in the morning. Every time the man in the room on the other side sneezed, we",2,1
"the actual hotel is pretty ugly inside. the rooms are very small without too much attention to aesthetics, but it's a great place to stay if you're going to be out a lot. it's in an amazing location with fantastic cafés around right in the middle of the quartier latin. very very close to a metro stop. there's no elevator so carrying our bags up the stairs sucked a lot. there's an american who's at the front desk a lot who's pretty miserable. she's not very friendly (not mean, just unhappy i think). they ""make breakfast"" meaning they give you bread and jam and a little coffee or tea. it's good if you're a student who doesn't mind staying in places that aren't really nice. it's very functional and surprisingly clean. i was fine with it but wasn't particularly impressed either.",2,1
"We booked our stay in Marignan for 3 nights during the peak time of Rugby World Cup. Knowing how busy it may be in Paris at that time, we made sure we booked months in advance (7 months to be exact). Our booking was confirmed via e mail. We received our reservation. A month before our arrival, I wanted to make sure the booking was still there, so I emailed them again. I offered to pay in full prior to our arrival. Payment was declined (as u can only pay in advance with credit card for higher amounts, otherwise it’s cash only). However they (again) did confirm our booking.   So imagine our surprise when after an overnight flight from NYC, we finally arrive at the hotel and are told that they don't have a room for us and are fully occupied.........

"I stayed here in Sept '05 with friends. We're students, so we don't mind somewhere a little rough around the edges- to a point.   Location was a big plus. It's situated on a quiet street -rue de Sommerard- in the middle of the Quartier Latin, so it's close to a few metro stops and within walking distance of plenty of sights.  At the last minute, one of our group couldn't make it. We explained this to the staff when we arrived, but it meant that they moved us to three different rooms during the course of our 5-day stay, to accomodate other guests.

"I have stayed at Hotel Marignan on three separate occasions. The first in 2005 was fabulous the staff was very helpful and friendly and I have subsequently highly recommended it to friends and family over the past two years. With the staff being a large part of Hotel Marignan’s charm, on my most recent visit (June 2007) I was extremely disappointed with the unprofessional treatment of hotel guests by one of the staff members. Neither friendly nor approachable she was rude to guests, acting horribly inconvenienced by their questions and inquiries.  On one occasion I witnessed her yell insults at a guest for using the washing machine after hours, which was not only inappropriate but disruptive to the other guests who could overhear her from the dinning area.

"We choose this hotel because it seemed centrally located and friendly on the web. It is in a good location, easy access to the metro and within walking distance to the Louvre. That's about as good as it gets. We had a quad room with a shower. The bathroom was some what clean but the beds were terrible. We found bugs in the room and in the morning we had bite marks on our skin. The building had ""old charm"" but it is not restored. The balcony was nice but the furniture old and worn!  Stairs only. Communal toilet was dirty. Girl at the desk after we checked out was not friendly nor helpful. We could not wait to leave. Stayed only one night! We won't be staying at this hotel again.",1,1

The staff was pleasant and the location was good.",2,1
"I've just returned from Paris and feel strongly about writing this review about the Marignan.  The hotel definitely has its loyal following as evidenced by a few repeat guests at the hotel at the time.  Maybe it was the time of year, but I think in general, if you're over 30 you won't appreciate this place.  It definitely is more of a hostel than a hotel.  Friendliness of the staff-No complaints actually, and I don't agree with anyone who said they were treated like a nuisance.  I found Paul Keninger and the rest of the staff to be very friendly and accomodating.  His only fault is being completely frazzled and operating on an un-organized system for assigning rooms.  For example, my 2 friends arrived after I did and the only place he had to put them was a single room with two",2,1
"I stayed here in Feb 2005 for 6 nights after reading the reviews on the page.  Yes the location is good - it's walking distance to Notre Dame and Metro Stations, but then in Paris most things are near a Metro Station and if you are near a Metro you can get anywhere with such ease.  So the location is not such a big deal after all.  And you'd probably only visit Notre Dame once anyway.  The breakfast was tea or coffee and a mini baguette with jam or cheese and tinned fruit.  There is a shelf of books with useful travel guides and books.  The rooms are nice enough.  I stayed in a double room for the first 2 nights (there was some mix up and I should have been in a single room) and found this was nice enough.  Got moved to my single room 2 nights later and this was not as nice as",2,1
"After reading all the raving reviews, I honestly thought that I had stepped into the wrong hotel after checking in.  Room inadequacies are plenty but one should expect this as this is a budget hotel but people rudeness is unacceptable.  I checked in with a wife and 2 kids aged 2 1/2 and 4. On the first day after finishing their breakfast early the kids decided to stand on top of the bench in the narrow entrance foyer. The proprietor came and told my wife that he was not going to be responsible if my kids fell down. She felt so insulted as we certainly had no intention of passing on our responsibility for our kids to him.  On the 2nd day, my wife wanted to get some hot water to make a cup of tea. She was effectively reminded that local rules allowed for use of kitchen only after",1,1
"My experience at the facility was not so good. I had to wait for 15mins before someone attended the desk for check-in. Also, the hotel does not have a view for Eiffel tower as it is seen in some of the pictures. The phone in room is useless, oh it works! But sadly no one will attend your call either on reception or room service. I had to walk down to the reception and ask for pair of slippers but to my surprise the slippers were available for premium room only. The washroom had no toothpaste, brush, comb or shower cap and you cant order because no one would attend the call in room service. Also, they will provide just one small bottle of water for two people when you check-in. The rooms are really small, honestly i felt i was still in the flight, thats how the room are made.",2,1

At the beginning I had a lovely experience which quickly changed because of the rude and inconsiderate hotel staff. I was then called today and was told I had to change my room immediately due to renovations taking place in my specific room. When I was given a new room I walked in on a couple who had already been placed in that room. Then the next time I was given was not yet clean from the people who were moving out. The last time I was given was such a downgrade that I now feel like I’ve wasted my time and my money. Not to say that I should’ve been compensated for the hassle, but nothing was done and there was no sympathy other than a literal shrug from the front desk person.  The hotel",2,1

Breakfast food inedible, see below. Still trying to work out the scrambled cold eggs. The Eiffel Tower around the corner is a bonus. I can’t recommend this hotel.",1,1
"We stayed in the room which had the view of the eiffle tower out the window, we were only in Paris for 24hrs and wanted to stay in a good location so we weren't wasting our time travelling, The water pressure in the shower was terrible and the very fine line between ice cold or smouldering hot when changing the temperature was annoying.  From 3am to check out 11am, we did not have power(it was later discovered that it was only our room) .which was a major inconvience. You'd expect this from a hostel or very low budget hotel, not a room that was €250 euros a night.",2,1
"I'm not sure how this hotel has so many good review. The rooms are tiny (but that's most hotels in Paris) and dirty. The restroom is what bothered me the most. We had this smell coming from the restroom that we complained about. The front desk had someone come up to clean but the smell was back afterwards. We couldn't change rooms  because there wasn't any available. Moreover, the layout for the restroom was ridiculous, The toilet was in a separate room from the sink/bathtub. So after doing your business in the toilet, you'd have to open the door to get out and open another door to use the sink to wash your hands. Imagine how dirty the doorknobs are....yuck! The only pro is that this hotel was walking distance to the Eiffel tower.",1,1
we booked and paid eifel view room. in our bookings there are nothing that saying eifel view. and when we arrived we got second floor room whit no view at all. its a scam!  hygine: very dirty room smell of urine everywhere. somebody pissed at every corner of the room i think.    rooms: more like a motel room than 4 stars hotel room. small and very bad room.  location. its nice and very close with eifel tower.  overall. never ever ever come to this hotel.  you want eifel view book pullman. cos pullman blocked the eifel view from mercure. so dont hope you will get eifel view!,1,1

The door has electronic key scanner. Ours was falling off the door on the inside of the room. Brought it to attention of desk agent, said they would send someone to fix it.

On arrival we got 2 rooms, next to each other, with only one double bed in each. ‘There’s been a mix-up sorry, we’ll correct it tomorrow’. In the meantime, we were given a choice of staying put in the current rooms, or being upgraded but with rooms on different floors – with 3 small children including a baby this was never really an option. The next day we were told to check out in order to get the new rooms – so we packed everything up again, went downstairs and were told that the new rooms will be the same rooms we had plus 2 more rooms that are connected. Great thank you, we just wasted an hour packing everything up to be told to move back into the same",1,1

Other than not feeling welcomed. Again the location is great.  We paid for the upgraded room but the view was awful.

"I first booked and fully paid 553.83€ for the Mercure Paris Centre Eiffel Tower Hotel on 2nd November 2018 for our stay 22-24 October 2019, this means they had our payment for over 11 months.   I later sent an email dated 6th November 2018 to the hotel and you responded to confirm this request to the Privilege Room on an upper floor with an Eiffel Tower view. The cost for this was 70 € per night. I was quite disappointed with the upgrade cost at the hotel of 30 € per night for each night we were there for anyone requesting an upgrade when checking in. Why did they get the heavily discounted rate when loyal Accor Plus members did not.  For us this additional 40€ was quite expensive, and I would not have requested so far in advance if I was going to be disadvantaged by this.  I",2,1
"Sometimes we say.... we will always be outside and will just go in our hotel room to sleep. True... but in the end, after a long walk spent outside, you want to go back to the hotel to rest, right?  1.ROOM - with the price range paid? The room was pretty small. We have one luggage each and only one can be opened. I never opened mine, just get what I need and back to be closed to have a space to move in the room. 2. BATHROOM/TOILET  - the smallest bathroom we ever had in our many trips. The toilet? If you are on a heavier side, I guarantee you, you won't be able to wipe yourself.  3.

"If it wasn’t for location there would be no way anyone would pay to stay here. I was apprehensive due to the comments made but because it was close to the Eiffel Tower I thought I can handle the bad. Firstly check in was rude and the service was really really bad. We have a privelage  room. So not sure why it cost more or what we meant to get due to lack of communication with ALL the employees. The room is a nice size, but that is it. Smells, the toilet room smells like it hasn’t been cleaned in years, clearly it has but doesn’t smell it.it looks like it was painted and fixed up by a 5 year old with a paint brush, with the toilet roll holder falling of the wall. The toilet flush is falling off as well and that hardly worked. The shower pools water outside of the bath tub and u",1,1
"There is only one good thing to say about this hotel: it is located close to the Eiffel Tower.  That aside, it is barely even average for a Paris hotel. And they charge 300 euro for a single night's stay. Just outrageous!  I had a premier room on the 10th floor, for which the bill was EUR300, for one person for one night, without breakfast. Upgraded to Eiffel Tower view  The room was small. Just enough room for a bed, but no space for a desk.  The view to the Eiffel Tower was mostly blocked by a neighboring hotel.  The decor was damaged and old, with scuffed paint, old carpets and a shower that leaked.  There were documents from a previous guest in the wardrobe (dated over a week previously), so the room had not been cleaned properly in a week.  They made a mistake at check-in,",1,1
"i had booked Mercure Paris Center and many times before arrival requested for a Queen Room , i was there for my Anniversary and was given Twin Room where to Single beds were put together and called twin room. the reception desk was very rude and not at all helpful. the quality of service provided was terrible. I wouldnt advice people looking at 4 star hotel to book this property, its overpriced for its service and quality of rooms. location could be a consolation , but there are better hotels around.",1,1
"The location of the hotel was great but that was about it. The rooms were a bit worn and needed TLC. The shower was clogged and filled up after only a couple minutes which meant we had to wait about 20 minutes for the shower to drain before restarting. I told reception about this and was informed they would send someone up right away which didn't happen. I was only staying for one night so didn't chase any further. I did pay for late checkout though and thankfully I did as it look ages to have a shower.   In respect of price I do feel that it was fairly expensive for what we got. However, when a restaurant across the street charges 12 euros for a double cappuccino perhaps it isn't too bad! I will stick to Airbnbs in future though.",2,1
"Mercure Eiffel is located right next to the Eiffel tower. Also, rooms were clean and relatively fresh. Apart from this, there is not much to recommend. Breakfast was not worth the cost, poorly organised and the restaurant itself is depressing. For antone looking for at leadt some local character, Mercure Eiffel is not for you",2,1
"I stayed 3 nights in September 2019 in this hotel rated 4-star, € 260 / night.  It is true that the location is great, very close to the Eiffel Tower.  However a 4-star hotel usually had a very good service. In this Mercure Paris centre Eiffel Tower, the reception staff is unqualified/incompetent. They don't want you to pay in advance for the breakfasts, they bring you broken iron in your room (please see the photos), they are not friendly at all but talk to you like a friend, they don't know how to link your hotel booking to your Accord loyalty card...  By the way, I had a power cut when I was in my bedroom, I went down to the reception straight away, no excuse at all from the staff.   All in all, the hotel is very well located, but has an awful service at the reception desk. I",2,1
"My wife and I stayed for one night transit for shower and rest on our return to Atlanta, USA from week long Europe trip. The room was bare minimum (not up to a 4 star level), with no shower gel or body wash, no soap, no shampoo, no lotion. Reception never picked up our phone, we came down three times to reception to request bathroom accessories and they assured us those will be there immediately. In reality, they only sent one small round soap bar, nothing else. We will never stay in this particular hotel, looks like they do not care at all since the location is good. We stayed in another Accor Hotel in Nantes, France, where the service was excellent, like a real 4 star hotel.",2,1
"Stayed here August (2019).  Don’t even bother with this hotel, not worth the money, you just pay for the location and proximity of the Eiffel Tower just being a 5 minute walk.  Can’t find anything positive to say about this hotel and this is our second stay here, should have known from the first time and the staffs rudeness.  We had so much trouble getting checked into the hotel as they wanted our travel agency’s credit card details, to which we kindly explained that everything has been paid and processed in full and that the card does not belong to us and we have no right to share this information with them. When we said to them that they would need to contact the travel agency, they refused and told us that we were the ones that needed to contact the agency. Upon consulting",1,1
"All facilities in the room were terrible, especially the water and drainage piping of the hotel. The water coming from shower kept changing hot and cold all the time, with the shower tub is not draining probably, we couldn't enjoy any second during our best moment in a day.  The toilet was clogged up, with a constant mould like smell in the room that gave my wife a headache, luckily it was the last night we stayed. I try to call the housekeeping and reception but nobody answered, I had to walk to the front desk and get an acknowledgement that the in-house calling system was broken.  Besides, the TV was out of control with a fully functional remote, I had to walk to the front desk again, for several times, changing new batteries, requesting a technician to fix it. He had to",1,1

When our room had been cleaned none of the basics were stocked like toilet paper! I had to make 2 trips to reception to. Ole team teabags & milk & coffee & called to ask for toilet paper! Can you believe this is a top rated hotel?? No neither can I!  On our last day we went down for breakfast & still had 1/2 hour left, but to my shock the staff were already taking all the food back!! I asked for teabags ( again) & was gold finished! Yes finished! I then asked why they were clearing up when there was still time for breakfast? They said sorry & brought me back 1 croissant lol!  I am so",1,1
"This hotel has an absolutely incredible location. From my room on the 10th floor I have an unobstructed view of the Eiffel Tower and it is quite impressive.   The process of getting checked into this room, however, leaves much to be desired.   Upon arriving at the reception desk, our clerk, Woury, handed us our keys and we made it up to our room. They must have just steam cleaned the carpets (good on them!) because on this hot August day the room reeked of mildew. The manager later explained that on hot days when they clean the carpets this can happen. Not the end of the world, we headed back downstairs to request another room.   Our ever helpful clerk, who was assisting another guest at the time, asked us if everything was alright with the room and when we told her it smelled",1,1

Location though is amazing  My advice - Stay at the Pullman next door. They understand service.",1,1
"My friends booked this hotel for my hen do to Paris for two nights. On arrival at 3pm we were told that we had no rooms even though check in was 3pm on the reservation. The lady on the front desk was rude to my friend and asked us to wait in the waiting area while they worked on the “problem”. They wouldn’t tell us what the problem was,  so we were worried we would be stranded in Paris with no rooms there was no confirmation they had our rooms for an hour or so while we waited.   Then after three trips to the desk, seeing 4 lots of people get checked in before us, and no communication we got three rooms all on different floors, but we were just happy we had rooms.

"The only saving grace to this hotel is its proximity to the Eiffel Tower.  The rooms are extremely small and stuffy. The air conditioning is not effective at all - probably kept at lowest setting by management. We had to open the window for fresh ventilation but the cleaner closed it everyday so after spending the day out we came back to a hot and stuffy room each day. The toilet was so small it was claustrophobic. They should supply a step ladder to enable you to step up and over the bath to have a shower. If you have hip problems, as I do, please stay somewhere else.  When we returned from breakfast one morning the cleaner had done our room however had forgotten to leave us towels. When I asked her for some she insisted that she had left some in the room. She then demanded",2,1
Arrived on a 90 degree day. Lobby was equal in temperature as was our room. The AC could not keep up turned to the lowest setting. Rooms are not available prior to the 3pm check in so don’t arrive early.  The rooms are not much larger than an American closet.  Careful in the bathroom. There is a step up to get in. Plus a large step to enter the shower. Both the shower floor and bathroom floor are super slippery with no hand holds. In our opinion this is at most a two to three star hotel. Breakfast buffet was good with plenty of choices.,2,1
"Hmmm. Very average. I liked the friendly staff at arrival, breakfast, and departure. For the rest rooms are small and very poorly insulated so frankly this is disappointing for more than EUR 250 per night...",2,1
We were coming off of a Viking River cruise and checked into this hotel one day early as we were connecting with a Gate 1 Travel land tour. We were able to check in early without any additional cost. We also requested to be placed in the same room that we would be in for the land tour.  Our request was accommodated. The first night stay was paid by us. Around 293.00 euros. We are in room 630 which is at the end of the hall. We have two twin beds which we have put together to modify to a king. Unfortunately they don’t have any type of foam “T” that can go across the mattresses for a married couple. So you either choose a room with a queen bed or a room with two twins that you can push together. The room is quite small.   Not as spacious as one would expect for a four-star hotel.,2,1
"My king size bed turned out to be two single beds with a gap between them... so I woke up with a terrible back pain. When I told the receptionist about it while checking out I just go a “oh, ok”. No sorry, no nothing. The gym at the hotel is a joke. It’s basically a small box room with a couple of old machines and a funny smell. The only nice things about the hotel are breakfast (it was actually very nice) and the location (literally next to the Eiffel Tower).",1,1
"First, let me start by saying the location of this hotel is wonderful! You are about two blocks from the Eiffel Tower. That’s about the only good thing about this hotel. The staff of this hotel is so rude and their attitude is deplorable! The lady that works the front desk at the breakfast buffet, literally, yelled at me and snatched a coffee mug out of my hand. I couldn’t believe it!!! Apparently, when I brought it to the front desk’s attention, they said she receives complaints daily. My question is: if she receives complaints daily, why is she still employed by the Mercure? The way she treated me was terrible! Thinking of it still makes me angry and embarrasses me! The rooms are very small. Beds and pillows, not good. The soap in the shower comes from a dispensary. Overall,",2,1
"This has to be the worst hotel I have ever had the displeasure of staying at..  Once we arrived I asked if they had any suite rooms available which they did and I paid extra to upgrade to this room, as soon as we arrived in the room it was small and could hardly move around in the room even though it was a supposedly suite room!  Throughout the stay was difficult I paid with a credit card and had that on my room but every time I went to buy a drink from the bar I had to pay with cash as they say they don’t accept room chargers in their own bar   Terrible experience from this hotel I have stayed in better hotels in 3rd world counties I have visited   Stay away",1,1
"I have booked this hotel for my father’s bday as he loves Paris and Eiffel Tower. We have booked 2 rooms with eiffel tower view. At the arrival: reservations were not as requested in the system. One with the view one without. Ok, we got a upgrade to suite on the third floor. But that’s no problem. As long as my father could enjoy the view.  As part of our reservation we were able to enjoy our free minibar, everything there was daily replaced. We thought: great! Only after arrival, minibar empty. We called reception, we went down to reception, we called reception again, this all within 2h. Still no action. Then the manager got it replaced.  We thought that’s still OK. Next day we came back to the room and our change money was gone from the table. Probably people think it is a",2,1
"We cannot adjust the air-conditioner at room and the room temperature is too high, the staff replied it's by controlled by central, But we found that the temperature was very low when we open the door, so the staff suggest to give us a fan in room. The toilet is not very clean, it's quite smelly for the toilet. Since there's no door for the bathing area, water easily spread out",2,1
"We arrived at 14:00 and the room wasn’t ready for us, the receptionist told us that we had to wait one and a half hours and he lied to us that the regular check in schedule is at 15:00. When we showed a other receptionist that our check in time was at 14:00, she told us that the only thing we could do is to wait! She offered us a other room, with the same price, she told us that it wouldn’t have the same view as our(that it would be so good) and that it would be smaller in space than our. We didn’t accept the offer and we were forced to wait 45 minutes, when at the end of the day they gave us a different room than the booked one (lower value and less good), and when we asked if the room we got us the one we booked or a different one, your staff offended us and told us that if we",1,1
"Please let me preface this by saying; I travel a lot (every month) internationally for work and pleasure so I know a wide array of hotels, airbnb and etc. I am aware that touristy places like Paris you will pay more for less because you do not come there to stay on the hotel. You are there to experience the city....with that said Where do I start with this hell hole? First off, this place is not a 4Star anything, it is 1 start at best. You would do better going to a motel or hostile. The best part of this hotel is the lobby, it is deceiving. The front desk is warm and welcoming but the minute you step foot in the elevator it goes to hell after that. The hallways smelled moldy and the rooms smelled worst. I was suppose to be in a premier room that has complimentary robe, slippers",1,1
"The only thing going for this ultra-modern hotel is its location near the Eiffel Tower.  But then the tower is now surrounded by a security fence and glass panels so that one must pass through a security line to walk under it.   Of all the hotel and motel breakfasts, the Hotel Mercure ranks near the very bottom. The eggs, sausage links, and crepes were tepid at best. I did not want Nutella on my crepes and there is no maple syrup in all of France.  In addition the turn around and replacement of clean coffee cups created temporary shortages.  The elevators are light years ahead of others.  Instead of pushing an up or down button, one pushes the desired floor on a touch screen which returns whether elevator A, B, or C is going to that floor.  It worked well when we were the only",2,1
Check in was pretty smooth but that was about it.  No closets or drawer space in the room.  We got partial rolls of toilet paper.  No toiletries. Room was being made up at 5pm and we needed to get to dinner.  Wasn’t even cleaned that well.  Staff was ok but a bit on the arrogant side and inflexible with their “rules”. Checking out early and no staff to assist with bags.  Made a reservation to take river boat ride and the guy at the counter told us the last boat left at 9p.  We rushed through dinner only to find out boats ran much later than that.,2,1
"My review is specifically based on the booking experience. I understand that I had booked a non-refundable room and should have weighed in the risks of the same.  However, I have been denied a Schengen visa and hence need to cancel my Euro trip. Being an Accor member, I asked them for a refund and I was also OK with Hotel credits which I can use later for the same or different hotel. However, all I got was that nothing can be done. Honestly I was expecting more, being a member. Also, given the fact that it was not due to any personal reason that I need to cancel the trip.",1,1
I stayed in room 801 Tour Eiffel Accor Mercure was right behind the elevators. Fortunately I had some sleep aids. The noise otherwise is really absurd. You might want to sound deaden that wall!   xxxxxx,2,1
"Unfriendly and unhelpful staffs,even showing the arrogance attitude towards guests. More frustrated the room size is ridiculously small as well as the shower room so small that they are having a bathtub in there which is a waste of space and illogical. Have to stretch my leg and cross over the bathtub to get into shower, if you having knee or joint issue BEWARE! Shower water flows everywhere because the design to trap water was badly designed and planned. Other than the location which is few minutes walking away from Eiffel Tower this hotel is no way can be rated as 4 Star and definitely not valued for money.",1,1
"So I won’t compare this hotel to 5 star hotel’s I’ve been to. I will just compare it to the hotel itself. So I chose this place because everything else was booked. The only good thing about this place is the location. It is just steps away from the Eiffel tower. So, first the workers are WONDERFUL, absolutely wonderful. Great people. The hotel is claimed to be 4 stars however, I’ve stayed at 4 star hotels before and they were so much better compared to this one. The rooms are VERY small and I had the advantage room. I don't know if this is normal for France. The bathroom was very small. The elevators at times do not open or shut really fast. The breakfast was a joke. Reminds me of a holiday Inn. Wife is SLOW. Would I stay here again No absolutely not especially for the price.",2,1
"Warning! This is a very based review. Spent two nights here in the privileged room. These are my ratings of the room out of 10: - house keeping is a 2 for me. Towels were dirty, random long pieces of hair hanging from the lamps, in the bathroom and to top it off, house keeping staff were not miserable - they were emotionless.  - quality of sleep is 5. Personally prefer a harder mattress but this is personal choice - room quality is 5. For the privileged room, we did not receive glass cups or actual mugs; in place of them were plastic cups. This is not a major problem but just adds to the general feel of the room. Amenities were okay, not too exciting - again not a major problem. Mini bar was free although had no alcohol and only consisted of a couple of drinks. - bathroom is a",2,1

"The only good thing about this hotel is the location. It’s located around 5minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower. We arrived at 2:00pm and our room wasn’t ready until 3pm, it’s clear that the hotel isn’t very organised as the whole lobby was filled with people waiting for their room to be ready as they were families sleeping on the sofas etc. Not good service at all & staff aren’t very accommodating. Once our room was finally ready, the access to the room were filled with room service trays which were left outside the doors & even after we went out & returned the trays were still outside the rooms. Wouldn’t stay here again. Try the Pullman Hotel next door!",2,1
"This hotel is definitely not 4 star quality. While the location was good, a couple blocks from the Eiffel Tour, that was about the only good thing about it. It had a weird bathroom configuration with the toilet in one room and the shower and sink in another. The shower also has a high step into it that was awkward. The beds and bedding were not comfortable at all and the temperature could have been cooler. Glad we only spent one night here, considering how much we paid. Very disappointing.",2,1
"This review is for the El Jardin restauant only, not the hotel. Walked across the street from our apartment to dine at the Mercury hotel restaurant. 10 minute wait for a waiter to show up. He appeared to be taken aback when we wanted to order drinks then food. To accommodate the waiter we ordered everything simultaneously. The Caesar salad was top notch. Everything else was so-so. The Sprite that my grand daughter ordered had no fizz. The basmati rice was undercooked and the child's fish and chips was clearly a low quality thawed commercial product. Again a ten minute wait to be noticed and the table cleared. Despite requesting a dessert menu we were presented with a check that sat for 7 minutes with a credit card before we scraped up all our Euros and paid with cash This kind",2,1
Worst hotel reception service in over 30 years of regular travelling. Staff think nothing of keeping you waiting at Reception. I waited over 1.5 hours after check-in time to receive one of the 2 rooms I had booked and paid for months earlier. Queue at Reception was often 20 people deep. Keys issued didn't work and then you are stuck back queueing again. Asked a question at Reception and staff member disappeared for over 20 minutes. If you value your time or expect any sort of service or respect. Don't book here.,1,1
"This hotel should not be classed as 4 stars. Push at 3 stars for that matter. Biggest drawback for our visit was the quality of service for housekeeping. On our 2nd day we returned to the hotel at 16:30 and our room had not even been started to clean. We told housekeeper we would give her another 30 minutes to address matter but after 30 minute period they had not even started. Complained to front desk and they aplogised for the delay. Next day received a letter of apology from management explaining that this incident was out of normal practice, but guess what? Same issue that day also, no entry to room because still not clean, had to wait again. I have been in many hotels all over the world and have never had this issue.   Management if you read this review please don't respond",2,1
"Tiny room, paper cups, toilet that makes those on  a plane seem generous. Location is good, they've given up on everything else. Whilst Paris hotels have the reputation of being small, they don't have to be as cheap and nasty as this place. I've never seen paper cups provided in a hotel before, even in one star hotels in remote country areas. Spilt food in the corridor remained uncleaned for over a day.",2,1
"Very small rooms we had a privilege suite.  Breakfast was terrible much better at the Pullman next door for the same price.  Gym was smelly, most machines were out of order. Disappointing as the pic on website were quite nice.  Complained to staff nothing was done as we were staying 5 nights.",1,1
"We stayed at the Mecure Eiffel Tower for two nights in July 2018.   PROS: The staff were really nice. The hotel itself was literally right next to the Eiffel Tower. If that is what you want then it's a great location. It was also right around the corner from two different metro stops, which made it easy to get places. There were lots of cafes around for breakfast, etc.  CONS: It is a three star hotel at best, definitely NOT a four star hotel.  Everything is a little tired and shabby, and for $300+ euros a night, not great value. We had to switch rooms because the first room smelled horrible (like someone had thrown up in it) and when they switched us, we went from a privilege room to a regular room, and in turn lost our view and in room coffee maker and free minibar perks (which",2,1
Positioned within 200m of Tour Eiffel. Lovely walk along Seine to Trocadero. Good transportation options with Metro and SNCF stations close by.  Limited dining options nearby.  Hotel dining room not recommended.  Breakfast OK but avoid the Steak at all costs!  Room as expected.  Clean but not immaculate.,2,1
"I stayed overnight in a standard room (€212) and was very disappointed by my room and the general state of the hotel.  In particular the gym is rubbish - I wanted to use one of the 2 exercise bikes but neither of them were working (no power). Another cross-trainer machine had a maintenance notice on it, so all that was available was 1 running machine and 3 weight machines. The whole gym was squeezed into a tiny space with no AC and no water in the water cooler. if I were Mercure, I would be embarrassed to advertise the gym as a feature on the hotel website. It's not!

The skirting boards in the room grimy, it appeared from long time inattention.  Three calls to reception to get action, even then the cleaner removed the tiny soap in the re-clean, without replacement.  Paper cups for coffee with no spoons just stirring sticks.

"Was told to stay at this hotel due to the fabulous rooms and views. When we got there, I had booked a privilege room, I was told it had brilliant views (turned out to be a car park) and the mini bar was free! I had asked them if they could decorate the room for a special birthday to what they told me was €4 per banner!!!! I declined and since heard many have been done for free! When we got into the room there was a heart lollipop with a note for another guest for their wedding anniversary?? Not really showing they know their customers. Went to make a coffee and no milk pods - phoned reception 4 times and still did not bring me any!! Room - tired and dull and the toilet was a tiny box room! When I asked if this was privilege, I got ignored. In the reception was a place of mouldy",2,1

Few examples - we reached hotel around 12 pm after a long haul flight, official check in time is 2 pm so requested them to atleast give us one room so that we can relax a bit, front desk lady did confirm that she may arrange one room but did nothing even after 3-4 reminders. Then I confronted their Guest Relation Manager and she gave me both the rooms immediately. I checked with the housekeeping staff, as per them, rooms were ready and vacant since 10 am. Why this agony to customer then ?  I wanted to have drinks in the room, funnily they",2,1
"I booked this trip for my husbands birthday. When we arrived at check in they said we had been upgraded to privilege room ( memory foam mattress, pillows, robe and slippers and mini bar). The quality of the room definitely did not meet the 4star quality. Entered the room and there was only one set of slippers and robe and the room was dirty. After the first night I had to ask at reception to change the mattress as on one side there was a massive dip and was very uncomfortable. They delivered the slippers and robe but did not change the mattress for four nights We slept on a very uncomfortable bed which left my back and neck very sore. The room was not once cleaned properly there would be rubbish left behind on the floor empty water bottles left behind and dead flies not hoovered",2,1
"I checked in today, May 15, 2018. When I checked into my room after much jet-lag, I needed to go to bed. I noticed as I tried to lay down that my sheet was scorched by some kind of cleaning service with hair attached to it. I could not understand how housekeeping could possibly have made the bed and not notice this. I went to the front desk and informed them of this information and even showed them a picture. As nice as she was, she was obviously was ineffective. As I return to my room at 11 PM,  I still have the same sheets with the same scorch mark those and hair attached! How could this ball have been dropped?!?",1,1
"The overall impression of this hotel was that it was very dirty. The check in process was chaotic with staff unaware of the amenities paid for and mistakenly trying to add charges for tax and breakfast! Giving the benefit of the doubt, staff seemed unable to read their own remittances which presented. Although they advertise air conditioning the hotel does not have it. The rooms were hot.",2,1
"Thank Goodness I only had to stay one night in this hotel. It is NOT A 4 STAR HOTEL Bath room ceiling was chipping and falling down, title floor in my bathroom had big chips. THERE IS NO AIR CONDITIONING Carpet and furniture is very worn. The morning we were to have breakfast it was so hot in the breakfast room you could fry an egg on the table, but could not remain in the room to eat.",2,1
"I booked a room at this hotel yesterday (less than 24 hours) and I called to cancel the reservation and they would NOT refund my money.  I just lost $1,414.23.  Don't stay at this hotel.  They don't care about people especially in emergency situations!  I imagine that they would care less about your stay either.",1,1
"Hotel location is great. Walking distance from Eiffel Tower.  Customer service is bad,  room service not available in the early hours of the morning. No toiletries are made available to guests and the beds are rock hard.",2,1
"If u are looking for a star hotel with budget hotel facilities ... than go for this hotel.. hopeless housekeeping, terible service ... looks like a budget hotel... sorry i should call it a HOSTEL waste of money.... Reception never picks up the phone... u have to go down to reception personnally ... no house keeping after 10.30 PM.  wait for long for your baggage to get to the room... only one conceirge for the hotel... disgusting management.... very bad and waste of money against service provide  Location is good ... very close to eiffel tower ... Room internet is very good Rest everthing hopeless... STAY AND WASTE YOU MONEY",1,1
"We stayed 2 nights at this hotel - which we picked/paid extra due to the amazing location close to Eiffel tower. Everything was fine when we checked in - polite, informative reception staff suggested we would get premium service because we were in a superior room. We left our bags, went for our tour and returned after 10 PM.  1. Immediately found out that our kettle smelt like Oust Kettle cleaner - when we asked them to replace our kettle,  - we were informed there is no housekeeping after 8PM, and  - no alternate kettles were available after what they claimed as ""checking all rooms""! - we were asked to use Nespresso machine to get hot water - which we did 2. Day 2 - we left our room at 13.20 hrs, leaving a Make My room tag outside our room. Obviously when we came back after 11",2,1
"When I first stepped into the hotel, the reception desk was not friendly at all. It was like I was a nuisance to the people. The room was not cleaned. Everyday I had to call for clean bath towels and sheets for my room. My girlfriend received a blood stained comforter and pillow. Yuck Yuck!!!!😜😜 The staff was unpleasant and unwelcoming. I would send a dog to spend the night.",1,1
"The only good thing about this hotel is that it is close to the Eiffel Tower. Most rooms do not have a view.  The hotel is dirty. The walls and floors aren’t clean. I came into my room and found wine all over the floor and wall, and glass on the floor. The hotel took ages to figure it out and get me a new room. No apologies . Instead when I show the manager the condition of my room, he shrugs his shoulders and says nothing. Gives me a new key and didn’t even help me to my new room.",1,1
"Not cheap but small room, small bed, no bath, no shampoing or cream just a bottle with a multi purpose liquid on the wall. No slippers, no bathrobe, ... a safe which block the corridor. I feel so bad having booked here.",1,1
"I booked using Accorhotels membership number redeeming 2000 points to receive a €37.52 reduction in hotel.  An unkown problem was encountered when attempting to process my payment for 123.98 on Accor website.  The p/ment did not go through and I rang Accorhotels got through to an exchange who phoned hotel manager. I was informed by accord hotels agent that the hotel was booked and the remainder of the payment was payable directly to the hotel.  I arrived on 23/01/18 to be told the room was cancelled and when I produced my booking reservation, a manager was called and fortunately there was availability. However rather than the prepaid amount of 123.98 I had to pay 161.50 as they could not now honour the 2000 points used to reduce the price to 123.98.  I was never contacted by the",2,1
"Great location and that’s it. Check in time is 3.00pm not ideal. After we checked in we found that one of the beds (a sofa bed) hadn’t been made as there was three of us sharing. Requested extra towels but never arrived, two towels for three people not ideal.   We wanted to have dinner at the hotel but the restaurant lacked any atmosphere. So we went next door to the Pullman Hotel where we found the food and the service to be very good.   Sorry we won’t be coming back.",2,1
"Don’t know where to start really.  A positive is it’s close to the Eiffel Tower that’s about it.  We arrived at the hotel, check in was slow but didn’t really bother us. Arrived at the room and went straight out. When we came back in the evening we decided to order room service. Took several attempts to try and get through whenever we wanted to us the phone in the room. Once we got through we placed our order for it to be wrong and cold. Wasn’t happy but it was late so left it. The next day we went and paid €15 for breakfast which is ridiculous. They called it a buffet but the only hot food they offer is bacon, runny scrambled egg and sausages. To me that isn’t a full English breakfast. The toast machine took around 10 minutes to cook the toast. The nicest part was the hot",1,1
"The first impression when you see the hotel is very disappointing. It looks run down with not enough lighting. Receptionist was not very friendly and when we asked for extra coffee capsules, they handed over 2 capsules. I found it very rude. Rooms are clean enough though.",2,1
The location is spot on like everyone talks about! there is restaurants local shops all within walking distance - I have written separate reviews on these.  We added on Breakfast however I didnt find It was really worth the money hot food was sausages bacon and scrambled eggs which didnt look great looked more like porridge- Neither myself to husband are fussy and we couldnt eat them. The Boiled eggs were also so boiled the Yolk was green again not easy on the eyes therefore really couldnt face eating them to have paid EUR19.90 per adult this really wasnt worth the expense.  We had a cosy room and it was cosy however we booked this to be cost effective. The toilet is in a separate room from the sink which isn't ideal to come out the toilet into the shower room to wash your,2,1
Checking in we didn't have to wait and were greeted by an efficient man who processed our booking quickly. We were given a room on the 4th floor which was quite small but adequate.  We had a twin room and the beds were comfortable but the toilet and bathroom were both very small.  Unfortunately we noticed something quite strange in the bathroom and one of the ceiling panels was 'propped open' by a tissue so this I removed it immediately. Our toilet became blocked in the middle of the night and we didn't want to  report it as we didn't want to have maintenance in the room at that hour or have to change rooms.  This issue was reported in the morning and I was told because we were checking out they would 'look at it'   The hotel did not seem surprised at this as though it were a,2,1
Housekeeping went through my luagge and stole clothes. Management did nothing to help even confirmed she was only one in our room after we Specifically told her we did not want our room cleaned and left the DO NOT disturb sign on outside our door. Theifs work here. Beware! Never will stay here again.,1,1
"We had booked 15 rooms from November 9 to November 11th 2017. As we had planned to leave early on November 11th by 6:45, we were informed by our coordinator that the Breakfast would start by 6:30 and we are allowed to take Tea / Coffee / Hot chocolate from the breakfast menu. The hotel had given packed breakfast to us. When we saw the packet, they had given us Raw Tomatoes along with small juice packet and a sandwich.   As we were entering the breakfast room, the always rude staff stopped us with the show of hands ( one you usually see at the CDG airport during security check-in) . We stopped and gave our room numbers. We got a  curt reply ""You are not allowed to go in"". When we asked why we were informed that the room number is part of not allowed list.   We told them we just",1,1
"Good breakfast and a god location of the hotel if you want to live close to the Eiffel tower.But nothing more than that.  Small rooms and very very simple rooms. For example the WC is in a separate very very small room without sink, which is in the bathroom. Don't know why they have built it like this. The breakfast is very good indeed. I will not stay at this hotel the next time I travel to Paris",2,1
"We booked this as our second hotel in Paris as my partner and I were spending the week here for my birthday.   When we finally came to check in we waited in line and  thought this would be quite simple as everyone seemed rather helpful. However, we got to the front desk and a young man checked us in. He literally did not look as if he even wanted to bother doing so, the most unhelpful person I have ever come across. He gave us no information whatsoever just our room number and the floor number then sent us on our way.   We paid extra for the privilege room which was the most pointless thing we have ever done as upon further inspection it’s exactly the same as the standard rooms you just get a higher floor, worse view, coffee machine and one dressing gown between two people. You",1,1
"Purchased room months before arriving. Even called and spoke with hotel personally to ensure we would have a room with full view of eiffel tover. Upon arrival, we were informed, they had no rooms with full view available. !! Those rooms were already taken!!! We were told, if we didn't like it, the pullman next door had rooms with view available!!!! Never again would we ever stay at a Mercure property!!! Or EVER BOOK THRU TRIP ADVISOR!!",1,1
"This is the meanest profiteering experience I have had in a hotel. There is nothing welcoming about the place. No porter to bring bags in but a relatively long ramp to drag bags up, you have to push a button at the second sliding door to get in even mid afternoon, 3 pm check in is rigidly enforced. There were 29 in our group who arrived at various times after noon but not admitted to their rooms until 3 pm exactly when suddenly, even miraculously, all of the rooms became available. Luggage had been stored while waiting for the rooms and so delivering the bags overwhelmed the porters. After 1.5 hours we went to collect it ourselves. There are two of us in the room but only one plastic glass for drinking. We were provided with 2 sachets of an obscure tea we didn't like and asked",1,1
"I’ll give it 2 stars as the bed was comfortable and the breakfast was ok but besides that: give it a miss. Stayed in a privileged room which was not a privilege. The rooms are tired, I have never seen a bathroom that small and at 300 euro a night that’s a complete rip-off. Don’t expect to get a view of the Eiffel tour either unless you want to pay extra. Not impressed",2,1
"I stayed here for one night so I booked this hotel because it was close to the Eiffel Tower. It is literally down the street from the tower. I originally wanted to book the Pullman Hotel right next door but it was booked. Anyhow the room was so ""weird"" looking. It looked almost empty, like a hostel. It lacked many amenities, it looked like a hole in the wall and they try to decorate it with colorful pictures and modern furniture. The bed was comfy though. There is no tub or shower door so if you do not close the shower curtain then you will get water everywhere in the bathroom. There were a lot of things in the bathroom that were old and rusty. There is no view of the Eiffel Tower so don't even bother staying here if you want that view from your room. I really wanted to see it",2,1
To start with we were given our room key and someone else was still in the room. Given another room which smelt terrible and the size of a shoe box. Toilet ridiculously small room and painted purple. Bathroom shower head is at waist height so you have to hold shower in one hand and wash with the other or you freeze. Bed is hard as a rock. Breakfast area staff are rude and try to clear your table if you go to the buffet even though you have a full cup of coffee on the table. Food spilt on the floor just walked through by staff. I wouldnt stay there again if you paid me.,1,1
"I would recommend paying more rather than staying at this hotel. The place is dirty. The lobby itself smells. They don't have irons (there's one iron for the entire hotel) and they didn't have enough towels!!! We booked a room for two people and the room had one big towel and a small one, I called for towels and they said they would call back. When they called back they said they didn't have any towels! I thought it was a joke. They knocked on the door about 10 min later and they brought ONE SMALL towel. It took them until 11am the next day to bring up towels after I gave them three reminders. The room smells like mold and air freshener. The shower doesn't drain and the toilet is down the hall from the shower... very odd. The staff was very nice and apologetic but they have tons",2,1
"We were amazed when we booked a non refundable room for 31 Aug for 3 nights via Booking.com, we informed hotel that we are traveling with a Kid of 3 years, they emailed back asking for booking a separate room for 3 year kid.!! We clarified that we dont want any extra services for the kid but still they are demanding for a separate room to be booked.  Please beware of the reservation the staff seem not friendly we are yet to begin our journey really scared of this hotel now.!!",1,1
"All in all, our stay in the hotel was not satisfying. For one, the room was really tight for 3 persons. My spouse and son were not even that tall, and me who's barely 5 ft and small set had to be careful moving around between the closet and restroom without bumping with another person, nor hitting ourselves on the door.   Inside the toilet which is separated from the shower is a ridiculously tighter space. Can't even stretch your arms sideways, and there's nowhere to place any items like pads, soap etc. otherwise you'll have to use the floor. The carpet has a mangy odor, the ref is miniature as well. You can keep only 3 to 5 small bottled water and a couple of sodas, and a cup of fruit. Don't even think about taking out restaurant foods that need  refrigeration, unless you",2,1

I arrived at my room to be on floor 1 over looking other rooms with twin beds ! Very disappointing .",2,1

When we arrived at hotel for checkin we expected a doorman to help with luggage. Didn't happen. Got to reception for our 2 pm checkin and we were advised room was not ready, come back after 3pm. No problem, we went for walk and a coffee. When we came back and got into room we were disappointed to find the rooms do not life up to the quality of the Mercure Brand. I've never had small paper cups for coffee before or plastic cups wrapped in cling wrap in the bathroom. Normally there are usually some toiletries, eg: shampoo, conditioner, body wash. But no, only small cake of soap and a half full container stuck on wall that says """,2,1
"If ever a hotel was trading on a name, this one is it.    As stated in the title, the hotel has a great location with its proximity to the Eiffel Tower.    The hotel rooms are exorbitantly overpriced.   2 night stay for in excess of 500 euros gets you paper cups in the room - a couple of small bars of soap in the very small plastic bathroom - no shampoo - no conditioner.   It is reminiscent of a backpackers. I am sure you could get much better accommodation for the same price.   I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",1,1
"Great location!!! You are literally 3 blocks from the Eiffel Tower. This is the best benefit of the hotel.  The staff is fairly friendly but the hotel is VERY crowded. Lots of people and the lines to talk to someone at the front desk can take some time unless it's very early in the morning or late at night.  The breakfast buffet is great! Lots of choices.  The room service and restaurant lunch and dinner menu is terrible and over priced.   They do have a nice bar, but it's over priced also.  Room amenities...what amenities? There are none. Everything is very basic. No frills.",2,1
"First, do not go to Paris in summer unless you are on holiday. It is hot, the hotels are expensive and it is way too crowded.  If proximity to the Eiffel Tower is what you seek, you cannot go wrong with this hotel. Wi-Fi is good and easy to connect to. Linen is fresh and clean. Splendid pastries at breakfast.   Some staff are really pleasant and helpful; the rest would not be bothered.  Do not expect any assistance with your bags. The rooms are small with bare facilities. Strangely, the toilets stink (in the room, the conference area and the lobby) and no amount of scrubbing could remove the smell in the toilet in the room. There are no supplies in the tiny bathroom except a soap and shower gel.   Food is bland, basic choices, there are not enough salt and pepper shakers or",2,1
"Organizers of a seminar put us here. I stay in many Mercure hotels and am happy with value for money. This one is expensive, we paid over 200 Euro fir a standard room, so small no place for luggage. The mini bar fridge contained food from the last guests. At breakfast we were shouted at not to sit at certain tables. Check in like in a zoo. Coffee machine had the wrong capsules although a note from the manager said superior rooms were specially checked. All in all a big disappointment in this Accor group hotel. Terrible service and attitude from staff. Perhaps if I give you a tip try the PULLMAN next door, but we did not stay there.",1,1

Requested for a room with a view - denied quickly stating that rooms in my category only had city (concrete outside) view. There is one bottle of water in the room with their compliments once you arrive - Yay!!! after that you will have to buy bottles from them or figure out yourself.

"Checking in to this hotel is an excruciating experience - the slowest handling of each guest, with so much efficiency lost by asking me the same information every time I come, having me sign a paper, and charging my card twice, rather than bundling room and city tax. Waited app 20 min in line with just 4 people in front of me.  Then I get a room just above the garden bar, which plays loud music outside, forcing me to close all windows...without escaping the noice.....! And trying to reach reception to ask when it will turn off...the phone doesn't work - ringing endlessly without response, or going to a voice mail service - regardless of button.  Finally, the air on doesn't work!  So am left in a loud, warm room, with no other way than this to provide my feedback!",2,1

The Front Desk Agent that I had the misfortune of encountering, Tawfik, was absolutely smug, to the point where I suspected that he actually enjoyed telling me that he couldn't help me.

Room not cleaned until 4pm. Kids screaming in hallway at 4am. On the positive made good friends with the maintenance man who was very kind and tried very hard to assist us.",1,1
"My family and I had a long layover in Paris and decided to stay here so we could be close the the Eiffel Tower. The location was perfect. We arrived very early, 6 am and weren't concerned because they had an early check-in option for a fee at 8 am. We were only spending the day at the hotel and had to leave at 6 pm so we thought this would be plenty of time. They wouldn't let us check-in to our room until 3 PM.  Stating that the rooms still needed to be cleaned. How annoying!!   Our room also came with breakfast and since we were checking out the same day we were hoping we could enjoy the breakfast that day. Nope!!!!!! They wouldn't let us have breakfast because we had paid for it the next day. I was so shocked, our rooms weren't ready and they made us wait 9 hours for the room",2,1
"Let's start with check in.  Our room was not ready even at check in time. The couple in front of us room was also not ready but they were offered and upgrade instead, The courtesy was not given to us. We left and came back 30-45 min after lunch and the room still was not ready. After a long flight and jet lag we were a little annoyed.   Room size is fine. We were here on vacation so no plans to spend the whole day in there anyways. The Bathroom set up was weird. You have to use the restroom in one room. Touch a handle then open another door with your dirty hands to make it to the room with the sink. Also, the bathroom smelled of old urine. It was drip marks on the walls of which i can only imagine was urine. The common area bathroom in the lobby also smelled of urine.  Check",2,1
"Stayed for 2 nights in late October. Location is relatively close to Eiffel Tower but still a decent walk away. Hotel itself is average, if not slightly below. Feels more like a 2 star than a 3 star and definitely not a 4 star. Very cramped and very small.  Some staff were helpful and others were just rude, really hit and miss. Left Kindle behind in room, on the desk. Rang within a few hours of leaving and told them about it. They said the had no way of knowing but the cleaning person said they didn't find anything. So began days of me ringing up asking if they had found it yet. Each time being told I needed to ring back when someone else was there. Emails went unanswered. Extremely poor service from a supposed 4 star. For the price paid, we could have stayed at a Hilton were",1,1
"Most condescending and rude check in staff that I have ever encountered anywhere in the world. Our ""triple room"" (parents and 10 yr old) was nothing more than their smallest standard room with a fold away bed squeezed into whatever space was left. The complimentary welcome drink in the bar fridge was ONE plastic bottle of water between the three off us. When asked if it was Mercure policy that all guests in the room share the same small bottle of water, the reception staff confirmed that ""yes it is"".  At check in they insist that you pay the full stay and any extras that you may or may not consume in advance for a ""quick checkout"" when we queried this they said they would email us the invoice on the day of check out. Well... They deducted the full amount but despite emailing",1,1
This hotel is ok but I have seen better. The rooms are a bit small and the outlet in bathroom did not work. Makes it difficult to get ready for the day when you have to get ready in the little hall with a mirror and outlet for hair dryer. It is in a good area not far from the Effie Tower and river walk,2,1
"While the bed and room was comfortable, and the location of the hotel is great, the room was terrible as i could hear the noise of the elevators going up and down all night long. Elevators, if properly serviced, should not be this loud. Sleep was impossible.  I tried breakfast and lunch at the hotel but the food was awful. As examples, the diced fruit at breakfast was soggy and the steamed vegetables and rice at lunch tasted like food from a microwave.  Also, checkin was very slow, even as a Silver Accord member. They were 'too busy' at check out to print me a receipt and would only email me one, despite my repeated request for a printout. Overall, poor quality hotel in a fabulous location.",2,1
"Booked this hotel due to having a accor membership account. Firstly I booked this hotel pretty early to only find out there were summer sales making the rates 30 percent cheaper! The hotel is right next to the Eiffel Tower. You can't get any closer than that. As for views from your room, you'll have to pay more to be higher and on the correct side of the building. Don't bother it's a waste of money. Wifi in the hotel gets worse the higher and further down the hall you are so bear that in mind. Hotel staff, well some are friendly some not so much. The reception staff are very forgetful. Called for an iron and refill in our fridge which never arrived after several prompts! Fire alarm woke us up out of our sleep on one day. Which instilled the most fear in our hearts considering",2,1
"Went for dinner and saw mice running around the floor. While they seemed to come from outside, it was off putting. It was even more off putting that while we ate a dog ran past our table - stopping to sniff our food. Portions were huge but good so you barely get half way through before you're full - it's so heavy. Otherwise it's a nice atmosphere and the staff were great",2,1
"Booked this hotel through Accor as a gold member for $1100. Then my wife found the same room at the same hotel on Expedia for $738. So I email Accor with a screen shot of my booking and what we had found on Expedia. After four more emails and half a dozen phone calls I was told that it does meet the price guarantee and not only would they Match the price but would beat it by a further 10%. Within one month I had received the 10% (€47) and was told that upon checkout the price difference would be reimbursed to me.(€225). Well what a lie that was, the receptionist said he new nothing about it, he said I would have to email there booking department,which I did straight away. I also emailed Accor without any luck. I will never stay at the Mercure Eiffel Tower again and will will not",2,1
"Great location but this is hotel is quite expensive but only budget quality. The rooms are very small, bare and tasteless, with ugly furniture and fittings. I found spending any time in the room depressing. As with other reviewers for this hotel, I found the staff service to be terrible, particularly reception. The electricity was broken in my bathroom and they refused to fix it. Even though multiple devices didn't work they said it must be my devices. They are happy to just argue with guests and tell you it is all your problem. To plug in elsewhere in the room I had waste time in Paris finding and buying a travel adapter which they refused to provide. For 200 euros per night in Paris we all know you don't get much, but you should get more than this.",1,1
"I visited two years ago and was very happy with the location and the service. Well, I'm still very happy with the location. The hotel did not treat us well as guests. I found them rude, unhelpful and uncaring. little things from answering phones while in the middle of a conversation, do just basic ban manners. The breakfast was very poor. Three hot Items and a small selection of cold items that were the same every day of our stay. The variety was matched by the quantity and the quality, so we did not bother to go down on the last day. The room was very sparce, every expense seems to have been spared. even the air conditioning was set to run on medium power and barely cooled the room. For a four star hotel, you firstly expect to be provided with toiletries. For the three of us we",2,1
"Well, this one time I didn't do proper research on the hotel. My friend suggested that we stay at this hotel as it seemed we would get a great view of Eiffel Tower from Junior Suite room from various websites as well as via Accor app which I used for this booking. To our disappointment, the view that we get from our room on the 8th floor is like the top part of the tower and nothing like what they show on the website/app. I made a note that our stay is to celebrate my big O birthday and as an Accor Platinum member, I have a bit of expectations based on my recent stay at SO Sofitel Bangkok which treated me really well. I understand that Mercure isn't the same grade as SO Sofitel but I expected at least a room with a better view for the price we paid. If they couldn't give",1,1
"In a delightful location just away from the eiffel tower, any charm this hotel might have is destroyed by both the staff at this hotel and the cut-cost hard selling understaffed repulse of the interior. For what should be such a delightful stay in a lovely city along the Champ de Mars, I implore you, DO NOT ruin your stay by chasing this disappointing and disrespectful hotel.",1,1
"Booked this hotel with booking.com and booked two rooms together. One double, one triple.  Prepaid nine months ago.  Somehow booking ended up two rooms twelve doors apart, two doubles, and our children were frightened,and we had to split ourselves up between them. Had to work hard to get an extra bed in the room, even though we'd paid for it and I had the email to prove it.  Sloppy service, terrible room tidy, no restocking of fridge (even with a drinks package), noisy air con and confusion from the desk staff to every question.  Would not recommend at all.",1,1
"Do not prepay for this hotel. I prepaid for a family room with 3 single beds. First, they did not give me the room I paid for saying I did not order that. When I proved I did, they gave me a room the family room I paid for, but charged me 50 Euros extra per day saying my 3 single bed family room only included 2 people. What?!?! I had no choice, but to pay. Also the AC did not function properly, the bathroom layout was terrible (separate toilet room outside that bathroom means everyone opens the handle without clean hands plus floor raised about 3 inches means ouch at night), and lack of storage. We lived out of suitcases the entire time and found it hard to get ready due to lack of places to lay things, hang them up ect. The only positives were the location to the Eiffel and",2,1
"The hotel is close to the Eiffel Tower, but the rooms are so small that two people cannot move around at once. However I would like to comment on the horrible service from all staff members I have encountered. Our room didn't have a ""don't not disturb"" sign so I called to have one delivered so that we could start our day. Waited 30 mins, called 3 times and yet still nothing. I went outside and the house keeping lady just handed me one she took from another room. The next day we asked for some water at night - the man lied to us and said he could not give us bottled water as it was the house keeping departments job. So we waited to the next morning to get water, again we called early in the morning, we were ready to start our day but there was no delivery for 25 mins even though",2,1
"we were travelling with a group of 5 friends and this was our first visit to Paris. The check-in process was painfully slow, in a very tiny reception area. While we were checking in, the receptionist promptly dumped my check in to attend to a couple who had checked in before us but then found out there was somebody occupying their allocated room. I waited more than an hour to get checked in, while the receptionist was trying to help this couple. My room was then given to this couple, after the receptionist had confirmed that all 3 rooms we booked would be on the same floor. Our room was so small on the ground floor next to the dining area with NO VIEW whatsoever. I am not sure how this hotel can be a 4 star hotel. The dining area was smaller than a passage and made it",2,1
"A friend and I biked through through France to Paris, and we booked our final night at the Mercure.  We were delayed along our route, and I called the hotel the day before our arrival to request that they move our reservation by a day.  They refused, stating that they were 'unable' because the booking was 'un-modifiable"" (i.e., against their own policy).  The hotel had rooms available on both the night of my initially planned arrival and on the new arrival night, so the move would have cost them nothing.  My friend, who was undeterred by my lack of success, attempted to move his reservation.  The hotel put him on hold and then hung up on him, repeatedly.  Comically, we were staying at a different Mercure property in Amiens the night prior to our arrival in Paris, and we asked",1,1
"For the price, we got a tiny room with a view of the top of the tower. The shower was excellent, but the shampoo/conditioner/body wash was a single tube of generic gel on the wall. The tea coffee supply was parsimonious (1 sachet of each thing)and not refilled every day. There is an early check in fee of 50 euro if you arrive before 4 pm! They take 30 euro per person per day from your credit card in anticipation of extra expenditure on breakfast or their restaurant even when you have paid for the room in advance. We used none of their services in response, and will report if they fail to refund the full amount, which was substantial for 2 people staying 6 days. I would not recommend this hotel. It was poor value for money.",2,1
The only positive thing i liked about this Hotel was its close proximity to Eiffel Tower. rooms were Small and Toilets were like if you are  6 feet plus person you will have to keep the door open to do your stuff. Staff though is cordial but limited. Staff will give you offers like early check in provided you give them good review and mention their names. would not visit it again and wont recommend either.,2,1
"Stayed for 2 nights on check in was told I had a standard room which I was quick to tell them I had a privilege room executive level with Eiffel Tower view I produced the papers showing this but it didn't have the Tower view written on it and I said it says it on their website!!! They said there was nothing they could do and gave us a view looking out the back of the hotel at roof tops NOT impressed as I paid a lot of money for that room and I didn't go all the way to Paris to look at dirty old roof tops 😡😡 was told take it up with your travel agent !!!   This hotel is very old and tired needs work the staff were very unhelpful, the only positive is that it's very close to the Eiffel Tower.  Would never stay here again !!!",2,1
"I am presently staying at this hotel with my husband and 6 yr old.  We opted to make it an early night because our little one was exhausted, only they failed to make his bed eventhough it was booked as a room for 3.  I kindly requested it be done both by phone and walking down to the front desk twice.  It took me getting angry to get help...  and 2 trips to the front desk.... housekeeping came 2 hrs after my little one's bedtime, and were leaving without providing pillows when they looked and couldn't find them in the closet.  I actually had to speak up and ask that they go get some????  This is not acceptable, I would keep looking elsewhere if you have a child.  It has ruined our one full day in Paris because we will now have a cranky overtired little one to contend with.",2,1
"The worst hotel I stayed ever, I was coming from airport and I stranded in long queue for check in as each guest should spent at least 10 minutes for check in and asking about personal information, so I suggested them to have information section to be used in such cases and when I did they got angry   Room is very trouble and I don't know which engineer designed it! The path room is very tide and not comfortable at all and it has one up step from the room ground   During my check out, which was in morning around 8:30, I asked them to send me the bellman to take my luggage down, I got chocked when they answered me that the bellman is start working from 10 AM, so I did by myself",2,1
I had the worst experience with hotel as basically they ruined me and my wife holiday after we stay in their hotel for night we realise we been charged twice and after I start called the hotel no one seems to speak English and if they did they keep me on hold and put the phone down and they put us through so much stress and thanks to our bank we get our money back my advise they stay away as I realise when I visit the hotel they had so many unhappy customer so check your bank and watch them as they charge us with two different company name,1,1
"I went to this hotel with my husband 13 of May 2016 and we stayed in the hotel for one night after that we understood that they charged us for 2 times and when they called them they speak French although I know they can speak English well and they didn't answer us and spent about 2 hours to call them and speak to manager, but it didn't happen. I never go to this hotel again and I do it from my bank, and the bank return my money back.",1,1
"My husband and I recently stayed in this hotel and aside from the location and some what ""modern facilities"" it's pretty terrible.   Paris was the last leg of our honeymoon, when we arrived we were simply given the key to our room.  When I asked for a map of the city I was just handed one over. Perhaps we have been spoilt for choice over the last few weeks whilst in ther countries. Reason being is, when we have done the check in process, the staff member will provide us with a map of that city, circle where on the map our location is and give us an overview of things to do, not even a 2 Minute education but means the world of difference to two tourists in a foreign country.....so back to Paris, no such thing. That's fine we took that....  Following day, I asked the staff what",2,1
"Upon checking in the hotel was organized, friendly and spoke clear English, which was helpful. The reception clerk informed us that we did not have a view, we ask for an upgrade which was an additional 50.00€ per night, worth it. They did not have a view room until the next day. Upon opening the door to the room I saw garbage by the coffee pot, an unmade bed and a dirty bathroom, obviously this room has not been cleaned or we just walked in on someone else's room. In short, they sent us to another room which was more acceptable but certainly the smallest room I have ever stayed in.   Upon upgrading the next day the room was nice, still small, but a free mini bar and slippers/robe for our use. Room was hot, but the fresh air helped.   Housekeeping could use some training or",2,1
"We have chosen this hotel coz the view to Eiffel tower from the privilege room. However, overall experience was disappointing:  long check-in even done electronically days before, prison-like design of the floors, very small room (privilege ?), most of the staff was unfriendly, poor breakfast (quality and choice), there were no towels in the room on the second day. They have good Wifi, rest room and shower is separated, view on Eiffel tower is just ok. For us definitely not a 4* hotel and overpriced by far.",2,1
I trust tripadvisor and i contribute alot. My fiancee's dream is to have à prewedding foto shoot in paris. I made extra carefull preparations and chose to stay at Mercure Paris Centre Eiffel. Booking a room for us and also the photo team to stay here. A 4 star hotel at this location. It was not cheap. But I consider the proximity to Eiffel and the great ratings as a safe choice. Great rest and sleep was a given for me.  I was not disappointed. Location is tremendous. Between Eiffel and Bir Hakeim. Parking available. Checkin was fast there was early checkin available for the rooms. Personnel are friendly and courteous. Because the room I received missed the Eiffel view I paid extra 60€ for improved Eiffel view. Why not go all out. Truth be told Worth it.Cherry on top. This view,1,1
"Stayed here for our 20th wedding anniversary which was the biggest mistake we have ever made. I am not going to bore you with the details but I would only suggest staying here if you are back packing. Absolutely ideal position but nothing else going for it. Service is absolutely diabolical. Rooms are like boxes don't know how you would go on if there are more than two people per room, we were banging in to each other and we had a so called superior room. which was a joke. If you drink tea take your own cup because they only have about 50 MUGS. They must think English drink tea from mugs. Food is OK but not nearly enough is available unless you go when the hotel is not busy. Don't expect more than one housecoat per room that way one of you will not be disappointed. Three day stay",1,1
"Just stayed there three nights -- location is great next to the Eiffel Tower and overall condition is good.  However, SLOW reaction if at all to problems.  Adjoining rooms are not isolated for either sound or smoke.  When adjoining guest was smoking - front desk response was ""What do you want me to do?"" -- How about tell them to stop smoking!  Clock/alarm in the adjoining room goes off for 1.5 hours starting at 6:30 AM and it sounds like it's in your room.  Takes them 45 minutes after notifying them that there is an issue before they finally resolve it.  Their resolution is temporary as it happens again the very next day at the same time.  We will never stay there again - that's a shame given the great location.",2,1
"Fine, I have got it. FRENCH do not like to speak in English. However I would expect an international chain to employ front desk/ reception staff that can and WILLING to speak. Upon arrival we were greeted by the usual ""hmm..."" After explaining that we have a reservation (without being assured that the lady on the other side have understood any of it) she ripped the reservation papers out of my hand and without a word she processed our booking. She gave us a key-card and than using the least possible number of words she gave us instructions: Breakfast 25 euro (a joke right?), lift is at the end of the corridor, room on 3rd floor. NO THANK YOU, NO ENJOY YOUR STAY. nothing. She also requested my credit card and charged 180 euros even that the room was fully paid for. I assumed that",2,1
The hotel is in a great location and it's fairly updated with nice modern fixtures and decor but the experience was terrible.   We had a member of staff walk into our room while we were changing clothes despite having the Do Not Disturb sign on our door.  We left the sign on the door but they entered our room during the day while we were out as well- invading our privacy.  The room service was terrible. They got every order wrong and didn't deliver an order at all one night- then over charged us when we checked out.  The front desk staff were apologetic in a cursory manner at best and were never available when you called down to the desk. The phone would ring for literally five minutes before it was answered.  Ruined our visit and we will never stay in a Mercure hotel again.,1,1
"It is now 5 days since we booked out of this hotel & we are still waiting for the release of the holding bond!!!!!!!  Room was compact but clean. I gave up asking for an iron to press my clothes, I did try four times!  *****Mainly need the Euro 240 to enjoy the rest of our holiday!!!!!!.*****",2,1
"This hotel is spot on if you are more about the location of where you stay. The Eiffel Tower is literally on your door step.  However, that is it! We arrived to be told we need to pay 180 EUROS deposit - which was not mentioned on any of the travel information/hotel confirmation. The toilet in are hotel room was a closet. Bed and shower were comfortable and very nice. No air conditioning in the room. The prices of food/drink were extremely marked up! No UK Channels on the TV. We experienced metal dragging noise throughout our stay that did not get resolved by the hotel staff - one night kept us up to 4am! The one day we got our room cleaned it wasn't. Towels were dirty. Bedding not changed. The toilet was cleaned with the sponge used for the floor, so toilet started to smell",2,1
"I believe Eiffel Tower isnt a good location if you want to see Paris. I would definitely stay near Notre Dam the next time.  I was expecting more from a 4-stars hotel. We upgraded so we stayed in the last floor, however the rooms need renovation. It would be better if we hadnt used the lifts as they take ages. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. It doesnt have a character, the location isn't good and it doesn't look like a 4-stars hotel.",2,1
"I have found myself staying in 17 different Accor Hotels (22 nights) over the last 4 months. Taking this and other extensive travel/hotel experiences into consideration, I would suggest that this hotel is not only overly and unjustifiably expensive, but also dated, in much need of the most basic of repairs and, in places, unclean.  If, like me, you are attracted to this part of Paris for business/sightseeing reasons, I would recommend that you considered the Pullman Hotel (also Accor) right next door.  In summary, The Mercure offered great reception, bar and room service throughout my 3 night stay - beyond that however, I would not stay at this hotel again.",2,1
"One of the core issues at the moment is that the lifts are being redone.  The old style of lift means there are no level buttons in the lift and they have to be selected from the outside.  Regardless, this is causing delays of up to 15 minutes for the lift to come to your floor and general confusion as to whether the lift is going up or down.  The buffet breakfast is atrocious and more of a 3* standard than a 4*.  Not only is the selection completely lacking, but the hot items consist of roughly 3 items.  Extremely disappointing.  Although the room decor is reasonably nice, strangely the toilet is in a separate room to the shower room.  Plus the volume of water from the shower was continually leaking into the shower room.  I was saddened that room service is also unavailable",2,1
"First of all,  Well located right next to subway so found the hotel easily enough. Literally a 2 minute walk from the breath taking eiffel tower but as soon as we arrived at the hotel things turned sour. The cost of the room was £485, but the Mercure were trying to charge me an extra €180 incase I wanted 'extras' during my stay and another €60 euro deposit for the room!!! So all in I was getting charged €800+ for 3 nights!!! Obviously I would of got the €240 put back in my bank but the point is we are tourists, we saved up our money to enjoy the sightseeing and nightlife of Paris and the Mercure want to take the majority of our spending money... no chance, my Mrs soon stressed her feelings and €180 charge got wiped. Then we got the lift up to our room and shock... the room cards",2,1
"Our room was at the end othe corridor, it was an awful room!Can you imagine a separate toilet from the batroom? It was so small , like a box! The last time we saw this , it was 25 years ago in a HOSTEL!!!! NOT in a 4STAR Hotel!! Such a shame!",2,1
"My experience of this hotel is horrible right from the start with reservations. They insisted I email them my credit card details (including security code) in one email. I queried this as didn't feel it was secure. They refused to allow me to telephone them with my card details and told me email was secure.  How can it be?  They didn't explain anything. I had to succumb to their pressure or else wouldn't have had a room.  Low and behold within a couple of days of supplying my card details to them via email I had fraudulent activity on my card of over £2,000! Of course I cannot prove this was caused by my emailing them but I do think its an interesting coincidence and so there is likely a correlation. When I arrived at the hotel, it went from bad to worse.  The check-in took ages",1,1
"I went to Paris with my husband to celebrate my birthday,I was really disappointed the room was super tiny and we had the smell of the toilet all over the room,we spoke to the house keeper and she told us that most of the rooms has the same problem,we asked for a perfumed spray but didn't got any.. The bed was comfortable though,that's the only positive thing about this hotel. For the money that we paid,they shouldn't offer smelly rooms,it's not acceptable for a Mercure hotel.",2,1
"There was only one elevator working on some days of my stay. I understand that they are being rebuilt but none the less I would have stayed else where if I had been told. The hotel should have disclosed this to expedia and expedia disclosed this to me. Further expedia advised that there was free toiletries, a mini bar, free bottled water and climate control airconditioning, None of this was in the room  The climate control is heating ONLY and the rooms were so hot we ended up getting sick. It was unbearable and could not sleep with no way of turning the airconditioning on to cool the room. Other guests had windows they could open. Our window would not open  Further there is no desk in the room like 99% of hotels. No where to work except a hospital style trolley table but no",1,1
"Easy access by Paris Metro; from CDG airport, you can take RER line B and change to RER line C at St. Michael Notre-dame station. Take off at Champs de Mars Tour Eiffel station. Hotel location is easy walking in 2-3 minute or using a metro station at Bir-Hakeim.  Cons;  1. I arrived hotel at 02:15 pm and waiting for a queue. At 02:25 pm staff just greeting and Check In through process include guarantee payment at Le Club Accorhotels priority counter. 02:30 staff said to me “your room is not ready yet” and she said “you can go out and back later” I have a question to staff for how long that I need wait because I am tired for my flight. She said “in 30 minutes”. I decided to waiting at lobby area then. After 35 minutes, I asked for my room and she told me “you room is not",2,1
"Hotel is very plain, not at all elegant. Staff is rude and rooms are so small that suitcases needed to be stored to reach the beds. There are many other hotels that are close to the Eiffel Tower as well as this one. Pullman is next door . One redeeming quality was the breakfast buffet.",1,1
"On arrival we stood in the reception for 40 minutes prior to being checked in. During our wait we noticed the staff were all running around on their phones, staff were in the back office and the priority desk guy told me ""I'm finished for the day"" when I approached him. After the lengthy wait we finally tried to check in at 4pm, an hour after all the rooms should be ready.... No, not the case, clearly the cleaning crew had also decided to spend 40 minutes on their phone as well.  Finally we get the room cards, so we head to ""the lift of hell"". They have three lifts, but only one ever worked for us, and this lift seemed to be shared by the entire hotel, so at least a 5 minute wait each time. The lift controls are outside the lift, level 3 never worked from the ground floor, so we",1,1

"This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in many hotels as I work as a consultant so I am constantly traveling. I booked this hotel for a weekend away with my sisters, we booked a triple room, which looked quite large and nice in the pictures. We arrived on Saturday and we asked to check in, we were already asked to pay 180 euros as a 'pre authorisation' for anything we used. This is usually an option, unless I hadn't paid for the hotel beforehand, I had already paid fully for the hotel through hotels.com so did not understand this. After a lengthy discussion, we had to pay tax upfront for both nights to avoid paying this ridiculous amount- we would not be staying in the hotel and how they came up with the figure of 180 euros to cover breakfast is beyond",1,1
"Friends organised this trip away for us, and whilst the rooms were clean and adequate, the breakfast arrangements were chaotic, some items were missing and the scrambled eggs looked very dubious.  On leaving the receptionist confirmed that we had nothing to pay......however some weeks later when my husband was checking our credit card statement he noticed that the hotel had taken over €400 from our account!!!! We protested and have been refunded but without any explanation as to why this has happened! This is the second time MERCURE in France have taken unauthorised payments from us after we have stayed with them......PLEASE CHECK YOUR CREDIT STATEMENTS CAREFULLY AFTER TRAVELLING!",2,1
We recently stayed at this hotel from 12th through to the 18th. We had a premium room with tower view. The view was acceptable however it must be noted the the pullman hotel next door obstructed some of the view. The room was extremely small considering it was a premium room so I would expect normal to be the size of a shoebox!  As previous reviews have stated the seperate toilet is roughly the same size as an airplane toilet. The toilet also had a constant urine smell which I tried to get rid of with no success. Did try to explaim this to reception people however as I dont speak French I dont think the understood.  Another point we constantly got our door opened with room service which we never ordered which was quiet annoying since we never ordered anything. This happened,1,1
"Ridicoulosly expensive hotel. You will pay only the views (If you are lucky, the will not guarantee that).  Tiny suite, I've been in regular rooms MUCH bigger than this suite. Even, poor cleaning and terrible quality for that price. Is ONLY worhty if you want views, but you have another choices with views.  The air conditioner was completely broken and we were on the 11th floor. The room was FREEZING and we made a complaint. The solution was a tiny heating that couldn't heat even the bedroom. In fact, we both got sick on a big cold.  You will hear everithing from the upper room (crew room) at late night.  They will charge you 180€ on your check-in, thing that they don't mention before, and after 10 days I still waiting that money back. Count with 180€ less on your holidays.",2,1
"So from check in things seemed pretty amazing! The staff were fab the building was amazing and the Eiffel Tower was all of 30 seconds away. Check in ran smoothly, free river seine your tickets, free keyrings, checked in, pre authorisation charges taken ( crucial info). The room was clean tidy perfect really no issues there. TBH the whole trip time the hotel was amazing and truly perfect.   Upon check out I asked about the authorisation charge. I was told by a member of management that everything was fine the room was fine etc and that my charges would be released back into my account immediately.  Now.... Here's where it's gone downhill. I returned back to London still awaiting my returned pre authorisation charge. Only to wake the next morning and find not only was my pre auth",2,1
"We were convinced into booking this place due to its convenient location, but after staying here for a week and seeing the quality of this hotel I would have definitely compromised on location or paid extra to stay somewhere more decent.  The rooms have a musty smell to them as though the carpets haven't been cleaned or vacuumed. The toilet is the size of a broom closet and has a constant smell of urine - no window and the ventilation fan does not work.  The only products available are a bar of soap and a bottle of shampoo and body wash in one - which would not be refilled unless you ask for it. No shower caps were provided either.  The included breakfast was a joke as hardly anything was cooked in house- the pancakes, pastries and many other dishes had obviously been packaged",1,1
"Firstly when we were given our room we had been allocated a double room and not a twin room as requested. They also add a block to your card at a rate of €30 per person per day.. this is lifted on check out, but just to make others aware. When we were leaving we were charged a city tax, only €2.50 a day per person, but our check out guy added it up incorrectly and tried to overcharge us by double, I had to point it out.  The rooms are small, the toilet and shower are in two different rooms, silly there is no sink in the room with the toilet to wash your hands.  On two mornings we arrived around 10am for breakfast, there were a lot of empty tables that had not been reset, we had to ask the table beside us for cutlery as we couldn't find any. On the second morning, immediately as",2,1
I would not stay at this hotel again when in Paris. When checking in the staff member was quite rude until she found I was an Accor member then her service level went from poor to mediocre. Our rooms were not ready although it was after the check in time (appeared to be a common occurrence as many people had to wait for their rooms to be ready). We were given room numbers for the fifth floor however when we returned (assuming our rooms would be ready and bags delivered) we were told our rooms were on the third floor. When I queried this the counter staff told me that that was never the case and basically bad luck you are now on the third floor. We went up stairs to the bar (they had a special of a beer and three tapas for a set price) only to be told that they did not have the,2,1
"With the price you pay there are lots more hotel you can stay unless you are in a big group which u need big lobby for everyday gathering.  Rooms are relatively small . To me just a very simple business hotel. For those who wants the real feel of local exotic decoration,this definitely not. Cold but functional staffs.  Booked 4 rooms x 3 nights yet not even 1 of the room facing Eiffel tower.Reason saying that we do not put on request & there are not allowed to allocate in such situation. In service industry with stars rating ,consideration is 1 of the important criteria where I definitely experienced this whenever I stayed in 3 * and above hotels around the world.  Bar quite small yet very high in price of the liquor even with discount ,pls walk few minutes away at others hotel",2,1
"We had booked a Eiffel tour room. It was partially covered by the pullman, which we knew and expected. What we did not expect was the breakfast buffet to be so ""2 star"" like quality. The tables were dirty and the food choice was very little when compared to other 4 star hotels. It had a college canteen kind of feel. I usually look forward to buffet breakfast in a hotel so this was dissapointing. However on the upside the location was excellent and everything in the mini bar is free (only non alcohol drinks available though). The room was very neat and clean.",2,1
"Having stayed at this hotel several times before I was disappointed to see I had been given a much smaller room. Pointing out, at the Club Accor desk, that I had stayed there before and that I needed a desk I could work by I got the reply that all rooms were small in Paris and that I could work in the business corner. Nothing could be done. It didn't help that the night table was full of marmalade either. I will not return to this hotel. I gave you the chance",2,1
"We booked a standard room and it was on 6th floor, online it says you can view Eiffel Tower but when I checked in I was told sorry it was not possible for this room, the main reason I booked this hotel was for the view the details are misleading and it was heavily priced, we wouldn't have stayed for morethan 6hrs in the hotel. This is good for business travelers or transit but not for leisure, rooms are tiny, the check in counters serve with just 2 desks.",1,1
"near the hotel entrance, watch for fake policemen who wants to check your passport. they took my money pretending to check for counterfeits and left the small bills like a magician. the eiffel tower area is full of pickpockets and aggressive vendors. after reporting it to the hotel staff, the real police told me that they could be romanian gangs.",1,1
"Don't be fooled by the photos provided in advertisements for this hotels.  The issues started at arrival as we were told that even though we booked a room with a king bed they did not have one so we had to have a room with two twins.  We reserved our room 2 months prior to arrival, so when I said this was not acceptable they told us they could push both twin beds together and that would have to do.  Again, we told them this was not acceptable so they said they would bring us a king bed so we were to just check in and they would fix the issue.  About 20 minutes later a man from housekeeping showed up.  He proceeded, and I kid you not, to push the beds together and then zip both mattresses together.  He said this is how all beds are at their hotel, that they did not have queen or",1,1
"Lack lustre hotel , with no atmosphere and next to zero customer care or service . The location is great if you want to be near the Eiffel Tower . The rooms have an odour about them , stained carpet and bedding . Really many better options for the price . I'm often an accor advocate but this property falls way short . The pullman next door offers similar last minute rates .",1,1
This hotel took 36 Euros out of my bank account without explaining what it was for.  Have e-mailed this hotel on many occasions without any success at getting to the bottom of the 36 Euro charge. They say they havn't  charged me.  But someone from that hotel took the money out of my account its in black and white on my statement. One good thing about this place it is very close to the Tower.,2,1
Not so good. Not helpfull at reception.You have to find your own way no help from reception and even the breakfast you got to do it on your own.only good thing about it its not far to walk to the eifel tour,1,1
Stayed in the hotel for my 4D3N in Paris. Paid a steep rate of 290euro/night yet disappointed with the hotel and service. The room has poor noise control as can hear laughter or talking from next room/corridor. And the cleaning maid did a poor cleaning for the room. The toilet has a very strong urine stench.,2,1
"Booked on recommendation of last minute, what a mistake. Very basic hotel, basic small room, only one sachet of coffee and tea, no milk and paper cups, no view except for the car park, no view of tower as advertised. Walls paper thin was abruptly woken at 7am by loud, noising, screaming kids.  Breakfast was truly disgusting limited and inedible food - definitely not worth the money.can't put into words how disappointing our stay here was.could and would never recommend this hotel.",1,1
"Just about to check out after a 2 night stay with a package. Their posted prices are over €300 per night Plus €19.90 for breakfast. Rooms ok but Small. Breakfast yesterday was just OK, we have fared much better at a £50 pn B &B This morning however was a Complete Shambles with very little choice very few staff and not much room to sit. They open at 06.30 and we went in just after 7.00 so no surprises for them. Our tour manager complained and then food and staff appeared...Too Late ..and No Apologies..",1,1
"As we arrived, the rude receptionist asked for a credit card to pre block the nights on my account, when our travel agent had already sent all the payment information to the hotel. The lady did not want to hear what I had to say and was really rude. During our stay nobody in the staff was helpful, the room was not cleaned at all, and the only person in the staff who semmed to want to give a good impression and to make our stay better was Charlotte from the front desk. Thank you Charlotte.  Perfect location, but I would definetely not stay there again.",2,1
"One positive: less than 10 minutes walk to the Eiffel Tower Negatives: No concierge. It is very embarrassing talking to a receptionist/check in clerk about things a concierge would normally have answers to while people are trying to check in or out. At breakfast not enough staff clearing tables and setting up for new arrivals. Sets of condiments not available on all tables. Guests continually borrowing from nearby tables. Basic breakfast foods / juices not replaced soon enough when used up. I had a wet backpack after walking in the rain one day. When asking about how to possibly  get it dried was summarily told to just go to my room and use the hair dryer. The one bar was a totally lifeless area. The ""free"" computers in the bar area only functioned spasmodically.  The room we",2,1
"Been jetlaged for 5 days that we stayed here, had breakfast the 1st day we went there, then we all got sick so didnt have breakfast the second day, the third day I almost didnt make it cause breakfast ends at 10:30 so the restaurant manager(asian guy with the worse attitude started yelling at my friend who was helping me just to bring some food up to my wife and daughter cause they were so sick I came back down and gave him a piece of my mind and told him he didnt have to treat me that way cause I pay money to stay there and all I got in return was being yelled at again and quote ""ots not about the money he says"" well.....it is to me. Came down for the last breakfast cause we missed it again yesterday which is where I am right now writing this review to say we weren t well",1,1
"I would never normally write a review after staying in a hotel but have made an exception for the Mercure Paris Centre. The hotel room was a lot smaller than looks online and the toilet has a constant bad smell which was off putting. Also the view from our room was very poor and miserable. However this was not enough for me to write a review. The worst part of the hotel was the customer service we received from the reception, of which who I think was the manager (tall guy) was the worst. There was a clear mix up on arrival as we had booked breakfast included in the stay. We made sure we checked this on arrival and one of the colleagues confirmed to us ""Yes breakfast is included in your stay"". As we were checking out they have billed us for 120 Euros for city tax which was about",1,1
"Hoping that this hotel would be up to snuff, it's disappointing that renting a suite here would give you nice accommodation.   The rooms are absolutely tragic and need to be refurbished.    I don't know how this hotel is allowed to keep the mercure branding however it's time they look at it and require a redo.    Skip this hotel.   There is no reason that it's not 100% updated and renovated for the money.",2,1
"I can truly NOT recommend this hotel. We wanted to have a hotel near the Eiffel Tower so we thought this being a large chain it would be accommodating for our last night in France. OMG what a nightmare. It was late August the heat in Paris was sweltering, our hotel could not alleviate us from the heat. It was hotter in our room than outside. When we shared this with reception they send a technician who was very nice but he couldn't do anything about it. So they send us to another room with a small Walmart fan!!! Plus they allow smoking in the rooms the hallways were filled with the pungent smell of cigarette smoke.  The price I paid for this room was outrageous considering the agonizing night we had. This hotel brings in guests by the truck load. They must have contracts with",1,1
"My family and I recently stayed at the Mercure Paris Centre Eiffel Tower hotel for my parents' 35th wedding anniversary.   We are completely disappointed with our stay with you because of the following;  First of all I booked 2 rooms for the 29th May for 2 nights (2 adults per room). Following the news that my Aunt wanted to join us. I quickly called the main reservations line to request a sofa bed for the additional person. I was then told that this was not possible due to the size of the room and for safety reasons they do not allow 3 adults in 1 room.   I then asked the reservations agent if I could book an extra room for 2 nights as well, she replied that the hotel was fully booked and that she could not help me any further. With this I went online to look for alternative",1,1
"Very disappointed to see my review from our stay here last week removed after one day. 100% honest review to highlight this is not a great place to stay. Other than its location near to Eiffel Tower (10 minute walk) and Dupliex Metro station 1 minute from hotel, I have nothing positive to add, the staff are not particularly friendly nor helpful - see so many of the other reviews reflect my point. I cannot understand the managers don't appear to have addressed this issue because it appears far too often to be ignored. And all you seem to get in way of a response is the same or similar reply....wanting dates, room number etc....how about actually dealing with the issues raised at the time and to the customers satisfaction! For our 30th wedding anniversary this was the worst part",2,1
"I have just returned from a trip to Paris staying at the Mercure Paris Tour Eiffel with my husband and my parents.  We checked out as normal on Wednesday 19th as normal and then leaving our baggage with the concierge to pick up later as we had a evening flight.  Everything went smoothly until today (Saturday) when we tried to use the card that the pre-authorisation was taken from and it was declined. After a trip to the bank, we were informed that the hotel did not stop the payment and now we are 350 euros out of pocket.  We phoned the hotel immediately, they were less than helpful and extremely rude. They said they could not help us, and they would only be able to deal with it in writing. To add insult to injury they then blamed us for the mistake as they claimed we “hadn’t",1,1
"Walking distance to Eiffel Tower which was the hotels saving grace.... Rooms are very small had twin room not double like stated bathroom not ideal either. No balcony therefore hotel doesn't really offer much in my opinion other than good location, stayed 2nights as moved on to better accomodation!",2,1
"We were booked at the Pullman next door for our honeymoon for 3 nights. (Pullman and Mercure are a part of the same Accor Group of hotels.) A few weeks before we arrived in Paris we decided to extend our trip for 2 nights. We contacted the Pullman to reserve the extra nights, however, they claimed they had no availability but suggested we book at their ""sister"" hotel right next door- the Mercure. Didn't think twice about it since they were willing to make the booking for us and after all it was a ""similar"" hotel with the same price per night. WRONG! Upon entering the Mercure, lobby, you can blatantly see it is nothing like the Pullman. We checked in and went up to our ""Privilege Room"" with a view of the Eiffel Tower. The room was the size of the bathroom back at the Pullman. But",1,1
"The only saving grace for this hotel is its closeness to the Eiffel Tower. Room very small, very dirty with the minimum of amenities. Room service only pulled up loosely the bed each day with no change of sheets (4 day stay), had to beg for replenishment of coffee and sugar etc each day and the bed was very uncomfortable. AC was non existent, had the dial on 5 degrees for three days and fan on full with no effect. Had the ""technician"" up three time in one day to rectify with the last visit a simple hand wave with the response ""its working as best it can"". Solution - Gave us a portable electric fan!!!!!. Overall the hotel was shabby and requires a major facelift. I am surprised that Mecure has let a hotel in this position get so bad This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel, the way",1,1
Please consider another hotel. The AC does not work even though they sent a maintenance person to adjust plus he gave us an oscillating fan to help! The rooms on the 8th floor have an odd smell. You are only given one pillow and no wash cloths. The carpet was stained too.,2,1
"We were scheduled to visit this hotel -- this summer -- from July 10th until July 12th.  Our European trip started in Cologne, Germany on July 9th and we were scheduled to drive from Cologne to Paris on the morning of July 10th.  We have 7 year old boy twins and we were planning to take them to Paris to celebrate their 7th birthday (which was July 13th).  The night before we were scheduled to check into this hotel, my 6 yr old son was bit by his grandfather's dog, in the face.  After 4 ambulance rides, our little boy had emergency surgery and was admitted to a hospital in Bonn, Germany for 5 days.  We contacted this hotel and requested that our reservations be changed, modified, or refunded.  We provided this hotel with hospital and doctor documentation about our son's",1,1
"Quite an unpleasant stay. Arrogant staff, would refuse to speak english. Bathroom had bad odor and daily consumables (i.e. soap) were not refilled every day. When you called the front desk they seemed to be bothered by your call and bar staff rude. Overall it was a bad experience.",1,1
"We stayed here as part of a vacation package. Even though the vacation was booked a year in advance, we were given twin beds. The room was small and there was a constant sewer stench coming from the toilet area. It intensified at night. We asked for a deodorizer to be placed and instead a maintain economic guy came and plunged the toilet. The smell persisted. The breakfast was included and was good. Overall I would not stay here again. Much nicer hotels in the same area.",2,1
"This is a down market hotel, just basic, with far higher basis for pricing.   The reception is crowded, slow and needs basic service industry training. The breakfast is so so, not what you would expect at this type of hotel. Location is great, very convenient to the eiffel Tower and quite a few nearby restaurants.  The rooms are quite compact, limited cloths hanging space, no room for a second suitcase. The toilet is micro.  consider this a 3 star hotel",2,1
"We arrived here Mid July hoping to have a wonderful stay at Paris from Australia. Upon arrival at roughly 9PM, we had to wait roughly 1hour for our room to be ready. This was a minor convenience, however at 12AM the whole electricity cut off for the whole night. This meant we had no lights; no powerpoints were working, and most of all, no A/C was working during this heatwave.   We had no phones charged for the following day, so no photos could be taken during our first international holiday trip, however by the morning the lights and A/C begun to work again. However, when we came back, the same issue had occurred. No lights were working, no powerpoints were working, NOTHING was working. We had called reception, and they have said this is a known issue and are working on it; only",1,1
"I booked my hotel through expedia and paid on their website. When I reached the hotel I was charged again 3 times for no reason at all. First charge was said to be just a hold. Still haven't been credited back my money. Second charge was done by ""mistake"" as per reception and still haven't been credited back my money. Third charge was done after I checked out of the hotel and left the country.  Nobody from the hotel knows who charged me the 3rd time and why it happened. When contacting the hotel I was told to send an email as no one can give me a justification or explain why I been charged for one room 4 times in total; 1 through Expedia and another 3 through the hotel itself.  I sent the hotel management an email more than 12 hours ago and still haven't been notified of",1,1
So I booked this hotel through Expedia as it had decent reviews and seemed like  great place for my visit to Paris.   Upon arrival our greeting was appalling (I am a gold accor card holder) and have stayed at many accor hotels which mercure is part of. Customer service was non existent on arrival. Customer service were more interested in the pilots and flight attendants staying with the hotel rather than individual customers.  This was a weekend away with my girlfriend to propose. I told staff this when I arrived; who didn't offer us anything. I paid an additional £120 to upgrade our room for 3 nights; the 'upgraded' room was shabby and my view was blocked by the Pullman hotel next door (which did actually look like a 4*). I could have stayed at a 5* Hilton/Marriott for this,2,1
Avoidable. This hotel is by any cost avoidable.  We booked the room and went outside. By the time we came to the hotel the room was allotted to somebody else with out our knowledge. When asked in the reception they were very rude and taking nonsense. Very rude behaviour. We tried to speak to the management but no managemet even thought of to take our concerns. This is reducilus and very disappointed. AVOIDABLE AVOIDABLE AND AVOIDABLE,1,1
"The air conditioning sucks and we asked for 3 times to change room and only technician came and gave us a fan. The next day i went to front desk and ask for changing room and i was told every room gets the same air conditioning. I could get another room when i insist changing the room. Then we can sure the first room air conditioning really got problem.   The housekeeping service is not standardized as i did not get any slippers at my second room. The coffer machine from first room is not working either, both of the rooms are so called privileged room. How could a large corporation gives such kind of terrible service?",1,1
Room with a view  in 1028 is near the elevator on the 10th floor and gives you a tower view from its second story up...Not enough closet space for more tha a couple of nights. Tiny toilet room and shower room. No dresser or desk. Not enough space for luggage or to sit. Wouldn't stay here again. Other Mercures are nicer. Good location though and breakfast included. Wi-fi free.,2,1
"We were cheated in this hotel. We stayed in room number 105 from 23 May to 26 May 2015. At the time of check in they swiped my credit card against my wish for breakfast for 3 days for 3 people for 180 euros. They told me that this will be reversed if we don't have any breakfast. We didn't have any breakfast. At the time of check out also they said that they will reverse the charge. However, they are not responding to my emails and calls. Their service was also pathetic.",1,1
"This is not a hotel to even consider. Small rooms, dirty sheets, awful dirty toilet and a view that has nothing to do with Paris. The building is old, the elevators are rusty and the fitness centre a joke. Sorry to be negative but this was one of my worst stays in Paris.  I tried to reach the quality manager (dial 2424 as the card on the bed says you should if you have any complains) but no one picked up. Tried it 6 times all and all but no reaction. Tried to reach housekeeping and reception many times without any luck.  I stayed in room 519 and it is so small and the view is a joke.",1,1
"They ripped me off. They could easily re book my room, that is why they didn't refund me when my plane delayed. I was shocked. They were rude. I have never had such bad service at a hotel. They lost my business and reccomendations.",1,1
"Late check in even we were there at 1400, poor customer service, unfriendly and helpless staffs even seeing us carry with few huge luggages without giving a hand. Not deserved to be a 4 - star rating hotel as they don't even have a standard proper shampoos for the guests, only soap and shower gel given. First time ever, I checked in a hotel room which is using paper cup for their guests, this is even worst than a 3-star hotel. Furthermore, I were so disappointed with the front service  because they can't even send the wine glasses to the room but requested me to get the wine down for the bartender to open it and get the wine glasses on my own. I never attend any hotel which provides this kind of ' self - service ' to their guests. Truly disappointed.",1,1
"Staying in the Mercure was a ever HUGE mistake ever just because we wanted the tower view room by paying extra money for that. We arrived at the hotel at 1400, the staffs stood at the entrance never smile and greet the guests any and not being helpful at all even we were having two huge heavy luggages with us. Then, the receptionist told us that the check-in time is 1500 yet we were asking politely whether can check-in early than 1500 because the booking stated check-in time is 1400 and we were in a hurry to get shower head out to Lourve Museum as it's last entry is 1600. In return, we got the lady receptionist replied us in a rude way as she offer us to check in a lower floor, smaller room which is very ridiculous because we paid so much for that room yet she downgrade us to a",1,1
"This hotel was awful. First, the toilet is in a separate room (not connected to the rest of the bathroom) and the toilet room REEKED like urine the entire stay and was filthy. The hotel staff were rude, rude, rude! I couldn't even believe it. I was sad to leave Paris but ecstatic to never have to see this awful hotel again. Oh and the location sucks - the Eiffel Tower is really far from all of the other areas you will want to spend your time.",1,1
"Very bad experience of this hotel as I discovered some bedbugs bites during my stay. One of these insects even fell from my body while taking a shower. This is unfortunately more and more frequent for all hotels, but never had such a bad service to solve this issue.  First reaction from Mercure was good and appropriate as they offered me to change room, which I did.  I asked to put the clothes I was wearing to dry cleaning in order to get rid of these insects for good. The hotel refused to make it free of charge for me (even though the dry cleaning cost was fairly limited compared to the cost of my 3 nights stay), arguing that there were no bedbugs after their own investigation... In spite of my indignation, they still refused and even allowed themselves some time to give their",1,1
"Well we booked this hotel for another leg on our trip. The location is good but no view of Eiffel from rooms, u will have to pay extra for a room with Eiffel view. The location is good close to Eiffel. No close by good restaurents. The service is also terrible, if u need something just pray that housekeeping will arrive within time. I dont recomend staying here",2,1
"The hotel is ideally located, however I paid for a privelage room with a view of the tower.  This room was extremely small and yes you could see the Eiffel tower, however the hotel facing takes up most of the view.  Separate toilet which is quite common in Paris however it was very small",2,1
"Travelled to the hotel by metro which was easy to find. Check in was quick and hotel seemed modern. Bedroom on 1st floor, good size, cupboard for the toilet. Great waterfall shower. Kettle in room but only one paper cup each and 2 milk. Bottle of Evian in the fridge, this wasn't replenished during the stay.   First night went to bar, we were the only 2 people there. My partner felt what he initially thought was a spider run over his foot. It turned out to be a mouse!!! I freaked out so moved and told the bar man who didn't do anything. Sat elsewhere and saw a second mouse!!! Both running around, not nice! Left and reported to reception who didn't understand what I was saying then when she got it she said ""oh, like Mickey & Minnie"" the main concern was the bar was on same floor",2,1
"My partner and I booked to stay here over valentines weekend because we have stayed in many mercure hotels and the location was ideal. We paid for an executive room as we usually do and what we got was nothing in comparison to the other mercures. The room was, as I was told by a member of staff when I complained about the room, actually the same size as any other room in the hotel. The only difference was a few added extras such as one bath robe (for the two of us?), a coffee machine, and an iPod Dock which wasn't compatible with the iPhone 5, 5C, 5S or the 6 therefore we couldn't use it. We paid even more money for a view of the Eiffel Tower which was good apart from the huge grey building blocking most of the view. Such a shame as we had paid extra to make the trip very",2,1
"Excellent location...... Cleanliness of rooms were horrid! My bathroom smelled like urine my entire stay and because the hotel was fully booked I was unable to change rooms. Items went missing out of my room and when I spoke with a Front Desk staff member she was completely rude and unfazed by my concerns. I spoke with a manager that made me fill out a report but nothing else was done about this situation. I was never reimbursed for my missing items or even given an apology! It was even insinuated that I could be lying from the manager because she has had this staff for years. Overall other than the great location and the fact that the Eiffel Tower is in your front yard, that is all this hotel has to offer. Will never suggest any of my friends and family stay here.",1,1
"I'm going to make this brief the rooms where fine except they were small. Breakfast was horrendous, had to keep asking for more stuff I. E orange juice,bread,milk even cups etc....and had to keep going from one side of the room to get a spoon or a bowl to then get cereal which was a joke as so many people were standing around asking for more food and drink to be filled up or brought out. Then valentine's night, this was booked a month in advance at their restaurant and they didn't even have us on their books. So we got put on a table where everyone else's was nicely decorated with candles, roses etc. We then  ordered from the valentine's menu and it was as followed, salmon rolled up with cheese inside not bad. Main, was sea bass fish parcels and yes this was ice cold so we sent",2,1
"There was a mouse running up our corridor throughout our visit we complained and showed the reception desk video footage. They just shrugged their shoulders and said nothing they could do,not even an apology or an offer of a bottle of wine. See the video I will upload, do not bother with booking here. Shame as good location",1,1
"I wish my standards were such that I could be impressed with the hotel.    My review will be actual and without exaggerations so please read carefully and take the comments to heart.  Besides a convenient location I thought the hotel had nothing else going for it.  The rooms are the smallest yet of any European city I have stayed in... about 10'x10' for the actual room.  Their bed, which they say is a queen is nothing more than a full... at 6' my feet hand off the bed or I am hitting my head against the wall and I can easily grab both sides of the mattress making it about 5' 6"" wide.  The bed sheets are the worst I have ever felt, 60% polyester and of a 100 thread count at most.  The pillow is 100% polyester and something I would only use as a throw pillow and never ask anyone",1,1
"The staff was courteous and nice to us, but the room was badly designed. Urinal and shower was separate...why? And the key card was erased a bunch of times. The air conditioning is unpredictable and the beds are not comfortable. We got robbed near the front entrance to the hotel by police with fake badges. Their story was that of counterfeit money in the area and they needed to inspect our passport.",1,1
"We couldnt'make it to the hotel in time because my wife lost her passport, and we just couldn't leave London. Totally Opposite of EUROSTAR that helped us and changed OUR NON-REFUNDABLE TICKET WITHOUT CHARGING us 1 SINGLE DIME, there was nothing the Hotel staff could do about it, they were frozen by the Hotel system bureaucracy, which doesn't respect or take into account unexpected stressing problems. At least Pierre was extremely kind and managed to upgrade us to the best room in the hotel. That was very kind of him, but it wasn't what I wanted much less what I needed. We were charged 201 euros just the same, after having wasted a lot of money getting a new passport. Besides that, the room cleaning was weird: everyday they left the our used Nespresso cups there, and some other",2,1
"I think a room should be ready two hours after scheduled check in. I understand things happen but I also expect a certain level of service when I am paying for that level of service. The indifference of the staff compounded the problem of my room not being ready. Giving me an even worse room after the wait was also a bad move.  The Eiffel Tower views are overrated since you mostly only see the ugly backside of the Pullman next door. If I had gotten this on Priceline or through a discount, perhaps I would be a bit more lenient.   Even after check-in and the housekeeping delay, the bathroom had the distinct odor of urine. The poor housekeeping and lack of customer service are not at all what you would expect.  My first day in Paris was pretty much ruined by this hotel. After",1,1
"Paris was our last stop in our Europe trip so we were pretty tired already and looking to unwind a bit once we get to Paris. We arrived in the hotel at around 8pm and promptly checked in. The first thing we noticed was the receptionist, she was very rude when we arrived, we chose to ignore it and let it slip since we were pretty tired.  Once we got into the room, it was unbelievably hot. This is saying something since me and my wife came from Singapore. The first thing we did was look for the thermostat so that we can turn on the aircon. Unfortunately the aircon in our room was broken so we approach the front desk to ask them if they can fix it or transfer us to a different room. Another unfortunate thing is that the hotel was completely booked that night. The best thing that",1,1
"We chose this hotel for its central location, close to the Eiffel Tower. The room was a reasonable size - we were expecting smaller. Our booking included a free one hour boat trip, which we enjoyed. We were also offered a late check out (4pm) at no extra cost, which we made use of to store our luggage safely and for a quick freshen up before heading home on the 19:15 Eurostar.   Unfortunately, this is where the good points end. The room was very shabby - chunks of wood were missing out of the door surrounds,  there were big scuff marks on the walls and stains on the carpet.  I don't know why hotels persist on using features in rooms which aren't washed/changed after each guest - usually it's a throw cover over the foot of the bed which invariably has a stain on it - in this",2,1
"This hotel cost us between $250-300 Euros for 3 people per night and it was very poor quality for the price. Here is the chronology of our stay.  We originally booked the room for 2 about 3-4 months prior to the trip then within a few weeks organised for a fold up bed for a third person. We were told this is fine and we can ask upon arrival. We also organised early check-in at 11am since we are members.  We arrived at 10am and was told that check in would be at 12pm despite our arrangements and that they would have to change the room for the fold up bed. By 11:50 we noticed heaps of people checking- in so we chased things up. We were then told that we would have to wait until 3-4pm to check in, by this point we complained and were put in the priority check-in list and got a room",2,1
"Sorry very late review, been really busy. The hotel is rubbish the staff are rubbish but it's conveniently located right near the eiffel tower. The poor service began from the moment we checked in.  They put us into a used room,  they room wasn't made and it stunk of odur.  Had to make a complaint at reception so they moved us to another room right next to elevator. The noise of the elevator kept us awake all night,  so we asked to be moved again. This time they put us into a box room with a mouldy shower. Eventually moved again in to a half decent room.  Stayed there for 4 nights and moved rooms 4 times! We asked for the iron in the morning to iron our clothes but this was requested 7 times before I had to go down to reception and asked to speak to the manager.  The manager was",2,1
"We stayed at the Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel for one night. Location is great, nearby the eiffel tower. This is something you pay for (280 euro!) and you get in return a very small room which looks like a 2 stars hotel with a poor service. For checking out we had to wait 15 minutes as there was no one at the reception desk....",2,1
"I will never return or recommend people to stay in such no standard hotel. No doubt with good location, but no quality staff. Everything was bad. Restaurant food was not nice. Room service serve by the restaurant having a bad attitude. If you insist to stay, my advise is take it with this bad memories with you. The assistant manager Isabel having a very bad attitude and service. Yelling at the counter between colleague and even to the customer. This is from Accor hotel. The worst hotel I ever stay...",1,1
"We had so many good expectations about this hotel. I've already stayed in many accor hotels, but never had so many problems in so little time.  - First, we arrived tired at 4pm and the 2 rooms we booked were not ready. - When we finnaly got to one of the rooms, it was DIRTY.  - We stayed just 2 nights, and 2 times the hotel staff wrongly opened our room door, one of the times early in the morning.  The only reason to stay in this hotel is the proximity to the Eiffel Tower. However, the next time I get to Paris I will definitely choose a better place to stay.",2,1
"The stay was pretty bad as Novotel a few doors down is exponentially better hotel. The aircon was making grinding noise like a mini jackhammer. I would recommend finding another hotel unless this is your last option. In my case, Novotel was booked out and I was trying to be loyal to Accor. Clearly wasn't a wise choice in this instance.",2,1
"Booked through booking.com and at arrival they couldn't find my reservation, although I had a confirmation number, they kept saying there was a credit card problem and that the reservation was cancelled.  The gentleman at the reception called the manager to find a solution, the lady came fully stressed and started screaming something in french to the guy and although I don't understand french 100% I could notice how he told her to please calm down in front of the client.  2 times she wanted to explain me the problem with the reservation and I asked her to please give me a solution not explanations!   We (my 8 year old daughter and me) waited 1.30 hours with no response went out for a walk and came back to a NO solution manager. We requested a taxi that could stop at an atm first",1,1
"Staff having a very bad attitude, especially the 2 team leaders name, Isabelle & Yann. Their duties is to solve the customer problem behalf of the manager when there is problem or request could not be solved. Too bad, what I had been going through was being scolded back and keep asking me and my sister listen to Isabelle. Yann even throw the mouse in front of us. Besides that, we already request to change in the morning with the manager. But the nightmare started in the night when we approach the front desk for collecting the new room keys.",1,1
"Ok so the location is fab, especially for the tours (highly recommend the segway tour and easy pass skip the line eiffel tower tour).  However, the hotel is very average. We paid for the nicer rooms at the top levels (we were in room 1011), but it was still very small...i guess thats ok, it is Paris. However, what wasnt nice was being greeted to a fridge with the last residents contents, ie a half eaten apple amongst other foods. not pleasent.   We told reception on the way out and they did sort this by the time we returned.  The next day, we woke up and i rang reception requesting an iron and was told i would have to go to level 12 to get this. bit confused so i left it. On our way out we saw housekeeping along our corridor, he asked 'service?' as we left and we said yes",2,1
"This hotel is average at best.  I had a burned out light in the. At broom that took 3 times contacting the front desk to get replaced.  The bar would have been more impressive if it was on the roof top and not on the first floor and there was a sparse choice of wines.  Being a Hotel in Paris, I would have expected a better selection.    Ate one meal in the hotel restaurant that was very good.    The mattress was not very comfortable and the room was very plain.    But, if you will be spending time at the Eifle Tower and the Seine River it is a location to consider.",2,1
Hotel is disaster. Everything is bad. In my room there was demolished dirty doors (toilet doors) there were some cables without insulation on the floor-just under the TV. And better do not comment the competence of staff  (probably they can speak english!!!),1,1
"OK, I get it - Mercure is close to the Eiffel Tower (make sure you write down the address for a cab driver - we saw a handful of Mercure properties around the city). If your idea of Paris is the Eiffel Tower, you'll be where you want to be. However, the location is not good if you're interested in walking to central sites like the Louvre, D'Orsay and Notre Dame. We didn't take the time to master the metro system, so it seemed like we had way too many 20 euro cab rides. Plenty of good dining options in Mercure's area, but it's not the type of neighborhood you'll want to stroll in the evenings. The hotel strives for a streamlined, modern look but just ends up feeling cramped. You walk down the narrow hallways and they have a college dormitory feel. Same with the room we had - tiny",2,1
"Room was ridiculously tiny. It should really have been for 1 person, but the 2 of us squeezed in.  There wasn't even room for 2 people to get changed at the same time, we had to take turns! The toilet was never cleaned properly, neither was the shower or sink and really, housekeeping in generl was absolutely appalling.  The bed wasn't made correctly and the carpet, despite having lots of crap on it, was never hoovered.   The toilet constantly stank of urine and really, twas just a horrible hotel. Ok, so it's very near the Eiffel Tower but so are lots of other hotels. I would absolutely warn you away from staying in this place.",1,1
Pathetic service. Check in time 12. Reached at 12:30 after long flight with small children.  Room only provided at 4:30 despite regular requests.No info provided. Some other guests were also struggling to get room.No internet for 2/3 days.Mini Bar not filled for 2/3 days. No toiletries provided for 1/3 days and provided only after 3 calls at 2424 and complaint at front desk.  Would not recommend any body to stay at this hotel.,1,1
"Room was very disappointing, paper cups to drink out of just terrible.  Terrible service from staff. Would not even think about returning to this hotel only thing going for it is that it was close to the Eiffel Tower. would not recommend to others",2,1
"Bathroom with no bidet, no bathtub and only a plastic tent for shower. Three elevators continuously moving on the other side of the wall. Totally unacceptable for a 4 stars hotel and especially for Euro 230 per night!",2,1
"I booked the privelege room with a ""view"" of the eiffel tower for our stay in paris.  Unfortunately, their definition of the words ""privelege"" and ""view"" differed greatly from mine.  I could have lived with the partial view (the top 100 feet or so) if it were not for the general condition of the hotel and lack of amenities.   Our ""privilege"" room was smaller than the cabin we stayed in on a ferry trip across the baltic last week.  We worried about the elevator due to the noises and vibrations experienced each trip. The breakfast was good, but during our meal the fire alarm sounded due to a malfunctioning toaster and it took over five minutes for the staff to turn it off.  There was no effort to evacuate the guests, so having the alarm sound for that long was quite annoying.   I",2,1
"I know the location is great but don't compromise quality for location, there are plenty of other options close to the Eiffel Tower. Very rude staff, filthy rooms, housekeeping never came before 2 pm, when our tv didn't work i phone downstairs (when the phone would work, most time i had to use my own cell phone to call the hotel because the in room phone didn't work) they said someone would be right up...30 mins later i called again (from my cell phone) 4 times before someone picked up the front desk then when i told them who i was and what room number they hung up on me, i had to call 2 more times before i got through and told them we were still waiting for someone to fix our tv and the guy rudely said ""i know, i said someone is on their way up"" and hung up the phone on me",1,1
"Absolutely terrible service!! They advertise this ""privilege"" room with a view of the Eiffel Tower which is what we paid for and when we actually got to the room that afternoon you could only see the top few inches of the tower. Not at all what they illustrate on their website. We went to dinner on the second night only to be ignored by not one, not two but three different employess while one of the waitors cell phones was going off in his pocket while he was taking an order at the table next to us. We then saw a small rat or mouse run under the table next to us and when I brought this to the attention of the female on duty (I thought she was the manager) she acted as if it were no big deal. We ended up walking out and complaining to the front desk and when the front desk",1,1
"hotel staff at night time is useless and not helpful they kept hanging up and not talking properly and not willing to help customers when they even came down to the front desk  in the tiny "" gym"" here the treadmill does not work they even called a ""technician"" who just started pushing the tread track and like a fool said.. no problem.. dude the treadmill still did not turn on. the machine is missing a plug.. fix it the other weight room machines are broken down the phone in the weight room does not work, so if you have a health issue god help you  the hotel is understaffed at night useless place would not recommend ever",1,1
"Very small room. We booked a privilege room, but it is the most non-privileged I saw till now. Staff not at all helpful and no vegetarian food in the restaurant and staff did not make any efforts to do.",2,1
Staff was not courteous or knowledgable of directions. Rooms small but it's as only for sleeping .  Paper cups in the bathroom and for coffee/tea not something you get with a 4 star hotel. Buffet breakfast was so so asked to due a money exchange they said they don't  exchanges that and there's a place by the metro ( no name or where). Generous with 2 stars but thats because of location.,2,1
"This hotel is in a good location. Minutes away from the Eiffel Tower, but not much else! The room was clean and the wi-fi was good, but thats where the good experiences ended.  Guaranteed 12pm check-in actually means a 3pm check in, with at least twenty couples waiting for their rooms. The receptionists seemed inadequate, giving us room keys that didn't work three times before we could even access out room. Housekeeping got around to our room at 6pm.. a bit annoying considering we had just came back and wanted to relax in a clean room after being out all day. The toilet smelled like urine and stains were clearly visible all over the walls.  To top it all off we were treated like criminals when we remained in our room after 12pm check out, because we had booked and already paid",1,1
"Our room has a great view of the Eiffel Tower.  That's the only positive.  Room is very very small, extremely cheap furnishings, linens and towels.  After researching several hotels, I chose this one based on reviews and looking at the hotel's web site.  Don't waste your time at this hotel, the web page photo of a typical hotel room is misleading.  We are VERY DISAPPOINTED!",2,1
"I travelled to Paris in December 2013 and booked through Flight Centre. We booked a twin room with a view of the Eiffel Tower. When we got to the hotel, there was no porter or concierge like the hotel advertises and we had to haul all 6 of our bags up to our room ourselves. The staff at reception were rude and obviously looked like it was the last place on earth they wanted to be. We went up to our room and they had given us the wrong room so when we rang up to inform them of their mistake they told us that they had one twin room available but there were NO rooms available with a view of the Eiffel Tower. Again, their advertising and what you actually get are completely different things. We were given a key to our proper room and again hauled our 6 bags up ourselves only to",1,1
"I consider that the 4 stars do not correspond at all at the quality of services of the hotel.  Sofa tied of in the reception, which is not acceptable for a 4 stars.   The rooms are small, the cleaning lady was passing every day, but the glass of wine that I had in my room has never being picked up during my stay. The cleaning lady would only make the bed. The room has not been vacuumed during my 3 nights of stay, the table where we were supposed to get our breakfast never cleaned and what I found unacceptable is that the toilet paper has not been never during all those days. I got the one from the previous tenant, not even had a new one. Point of view clearness a lot of things to change. Too expensive for what you get.   At the hotels bar you have to go an order yourself!!",2,1
"I wish right now I was righting about my fabulous stay at the Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel, but this did not happen although the location was fantastic the stay in the hotel was not. When we first arrive we was greeted by a lovely woman who helped get our luggage sorted and sent us up to reception... We where given the key card to our room and went straight up but everything was going great but i was soon disappointed to find the bed was still warm from last guest unmade dirty sheets, wet towels on the floor coffee cups used it was disgusting if id arrived early I may not have been quite as upset but arriving after 2pm & been told your room is ready from 12 is not a great start. The next room had a sofa bed which was damaged which my daughter couldn't sleep in so shared our",1,1
"In November I had a business meeting in Paris and we decided to go for this hotel. The evening before our meeting started we were met by a horrified colleague who told us that she had participated in an earlier meeting in this hotel and that there were several mice in that room. And sure enough, when we had our meeting, there was a mouse popping out every now and then from behind the heater and listening in to our presentations. I know our stuff is riveting, but that is not the kind of audience we expected. After two attempts the exterminators were successful, but still this left a sour taste. Apart from that not too much to report on this hotel. The lunch buffet was o.k, however there was always one thing missing on the buffet. If the fish was here, the rice was missing, once",2,1
"I booked a room with a double bed and told them it was for a first anniversary break. When we arrived at the hotel we noticed they had changed our room from the 9th floor to the 3rd floor. This room had 2 single beds pushed together, with separate bedding. I complained at the reception desk and was told numerous times that this is what they call a double room. I pointed out that the pictures online are of a double bed. After much arguing they told me they had 1 room but that it was a disabled room. I took this very reluctantly. That was not how I wanted to spend an anniversary break. The room had no bath and the paint on the walls was all scuffed. There was 1 complimentary bottle of water between 2 of us and this was not replenished on the second day.   A friend left an envelope",2,1
"It's hard to argue about the location of this place being so close to the Eiffel Tower. However that's about the only good thing this hotel has going for it.  Maybe I'm negatively influenced by the way too warm meeting rooms in the basement (aircon not possible to adjust), or the lack of housekeeping in my room (had to call twice in late afternoon) to get housekeeping to come. Or maybe my negative review is due to the meeting rooms had mice - yes mice - running around by the aircon units and the hotel staff seemed not to care about this.   Really not a place I would choose to stay at again, unless I was forced to....",1,1
"The location was great but that's it. My mother and I booked this hotel for only 2 nights with great expectations.  We were very disappointed.  Upon arrival at our room we were concerned with what looked like a bad patch job after a break in.  There was almost no disguising the lack of effort taken to ensure safety and security.  We found our room to be very modern but with the minimalist decor many things were missing... No storage space at all for folded garments, no shelf of any kind to lay out our things we needed, no desk or surface to write on unless you used the little counter in the shower area.  We requested a room with 2 beds however the bed my mom had was lumps and sloped to one side and the fold out couch I had was not much better with the bed sinking to the middle",2,1
"The best thing about this hotel is it's location!  You are literally just a very short walk from the Eiffel Tower and you can see it boldly standing from the hotel grounds.  You are also within a reasonable walking distance from many good places to eat, but I'd recommend eating AWAY from the Eiffel Tower as the vendors have figured out that they can jack up their prices because of their proximity to the Tower.  It is better to eat further away from the attraction and the food is excellent.    As far as the hotel, it is very clean and quiet.  The biggest complaint is that the amenities are missing from this proud hotel, and there are some maintenance issues that I have encountered after several visits.  For example, an wash cloth is not available so if you come here, you may",2,1
It is with disgust & disappoint that I review this hotel. We had a reservation this week in Paris to celebrate a special occasion. The reservation was made 6 months ago. Unfortunately we had a family emergency a week ago and we had to cancel all our travel plans to tend to the family. Needless to say the celebration was shelved.  Is this the hotels problem ? Obviously not !! We reached out to cancel the reservation and to be refunded. They have refused the refund based on their policy despite the emergency situation. We wrote to the GM who has not cared to respond. We are disgusted at how little care or empathy was shown by the management of this hotel. We understand that busineses have policies but would have appreciated a response and some flexibility given the situation. will,2,1
"First,  security.  Anyone traveling to Paris knows that pickpockets are rampant there,  but I didn't expect someone to lose her purse in the lobby of the hotel as she checked in.  This happened to one of our party.  I was at the desk also.  She had a ""wheelie"" bag with her purse on top of it.  She took out her passport and was doing her business to check in - looked down to return the passport and the purse was gone.  Apparently a man who was standing behind her, but there was no sign of him. The hotel personnel were absolutely useless.  The so-called security  man was good at Gallic shrugs and pretending he didn't understand my quite adequate French.  The hotel personnel up to the manager seemed disinterested.  The police report was filed, but absolutely no-one from the Hotel",1,1
"The location, close to the Eiffel Tower was great.  My wife and I basically walked everywhere. The hotel room was miniscule and tight, even though I supposedly had one of the better rooms on the top floor. The staff was amazingly un-helpful.  It did not matter whether I asked for a restaurant recommendation (eat in the hotel) or information on getting tickets for the tower (use the internet).  Even when I asked for directions using public transportation (I don't know, I never use it).  There are too many other hotels in the area for me to ever consider staying here again.",2,1
"I hope I wasn't so unlucky that everything that could have gone wrong in this hotel, happened to me. Also, I do travel a lot for work and I could say that I am a seasoned traveler, so I have my share of good and bad experience when it comes to hotel. First of all, the shower head was broken and it took 3 calls and 2 visits to get it running properly (on the second day of course). The non-smoking room smelled horribly like cigarette. The linen was cheap and uncomfortable. That's for now.",2,1
"While we were away from our room someone attempted to break into one of our items of luggage which has the airport approved lock. They managed to remove one of the Zip ends that was in the lock but must have been disturbed or they could not remove the other.  The dinner service at the restaurant is very poor as we were served main meals that were overcooked and the dessert special of the day, cheesecake, came to us with mouldy berries on top. The staff needed to be approached three times to deal with this.",2,1
"We booked this hotel on EASYTOBOOK.COM, but when we arrived at the hotel there was no record of our booking. Travelling is stressful and this didn't help. It took nearly 1 hour to get it sorted out and we ended up on 2 different floors (family of 4).  The lift in the hotel is a disaster! Breakfast is €20 each, so for a family of 4, €80 for breakfast is just outragous!  Great location though, but that's about all I can say about the hotel. Wouldn't stay there again.",2,1
"The only good thing about this hotel is being right next to the Eiffel Tower, other than that, I would probably look elsewhere with the price we paid.  The rooms are small,bathroom is tiny and separate toilet that smells of pee.  The cleaners are terrible, had an empty coke can that had fallen on the floor from day 1, day 3 now and still there, they don't touch anything or clean anything... Looks like they simply make the bed and leave , definitely need to get new cleaning methods I feel.  We had a privileged room which gave us wonderful views of the Eiffel Tower outside our window, but if asked if I would get that room again, I would say no.  Wifi is terrible, you have to log in every time you enter the hotel and it kicked you off quite frequently.  If your not bothered about",2,1
"The two things that gave this hotel 2 stars was the sllooooowwww internet and clogged up shower drain.  Using ping tests online, the speed was about 700ms, the worst I’ve seen.  The shower design sucks.  The shower head is held where your chest would be so you have to take it off the stand and hold it.  The shower drain was also clogged so by the end of the wash, there was about 4 inches of water which had previous people’s hairs.  Disgusting.    The room itself was clean.  The one positive thing about the hotel is that it’s next to the Eiffel tower.",2,1
"Booked in here as part of a Globus tour & found the hotel very disappointing, the front desk staff were rude and the rooms and breakfast a let down, because we were part of a tour group we were given below standard rooms, no coffee machine, single beds, requested a double bed and was told by reception that the hotel only had single beds!!, only one chair in the room so one of us had to sit on the bed, at breakfast our tour group was sat in a seperate area to other hotel diners and even the buffet breakfast was of a lower standard than what was served in the other area, even though we booked post tour accommodation with breakfast we were still treated on a lower level to other guests making us feel 2nd class, because we had been booked in by Globus. The only good point about this",2,1
"Booked here because it was close to the Eiffel Tower. Location is the only positive. Staff were ok, nothing to special but nothing to complain about. The room however was horrendous. Bathroom smelled like a public urinal, small & cramp room, sink is poorly designed (sink gradually gets water down but leaves residue because of the way it is designed), building is old and run down, prices in the restaurant in the hotel is absurd! Will be worth finding somewhere else that is a little further out as you don't get the view from your room of the tower anyway. Don't do it!",1,1
Have stayed there numerous times and the location is great.  Bathroom is tiny.  Beds are hard!  First time staying there in the summer ... Think twice before booking a room here in summer.  They do not have air conditioning!  Room was hotter than 80f!  I asked for a fan only to be told they were all taken.  The window only opens about 3 inches so that didn't help as it was cooler outside than in my room.  My room was on 4th floor over the bar patio.  It was extremely noisy from everyone drinking and playing what sounded like the game Caps.  I would recommend finding a hotel that has air conditioning during the summer months.,1,1
I just spent 4 nights there on business. We held our staff mtg there. Rooms were hot every night...poor air conditioning everywhere but the mtg room. Some days we would have cream by the coffee and somedays not. No one ever came by to check if we needed anything. Two days I got shower gel and no shampoo! The location was good and the employees that i dealt with friendly but ill stay at the Pullman next time.,2,1
This hotel would be considered by most as a 2 star hotel. As I write this It s a warm day in Paris in July. I am having trouble getting my room to a comfortable temperature (ie below 80 degrees). This isn't surprising since  there hotel lobby and hallways aren't even air conditioned.  Please listen to me and do not book this hotel.  I've had numerous problems at this hotel over the years ranging from no hot water to unbearable heat. I have no choice but to stay at this awful hotel since this is we're my company books me. Do Not Waste Your Money Here!,2,1
"First, with the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door, the room was cleaned anyway, twice.   I specifically asked no one go in the room, and they did anyway,  throwing out my daughters tooth that had fallen out during the vacation and some important papers, both of which were on the desk ""not the trash"".  I addition to those items, money that was on the same desk was also taken.  The front desk said they were on it, but nothing was done. they didn't even reimburse me for the money taken.  As for the value. now I know better, you can find much better for much less.  In addition, check your bill.  They like to add charges, like breakfast, which we never used.  Sounds sneaky to me.  Finally, we asked for a room with a view and was told yes, only to be on the back of the building with",1,1

Each time I called down to housekeeping or front desk, as soon as I started speaking in English, THEY HUNG UP ON ME!.  Called in evening 3 times to get an extra pillow. The next day they hadn't cleaned our room by 4 pm, so called down and they hung up again.  We finally talked to a manager who was very nice but would not stay here again. Also had air conditioning but didn't work very well. Our room was very hot. Stayed in July  outside temps 85 degrees F.",2,1
"The hotel is in poor condition and the rooms are very small and uncomfortable. The mini bar is barren and the walls in my room are cracked and peeling. The air-conditioning is sub-par, not cool enough. Overall completely overpriced and too generously rated for it's condition. It was a huge disappointment for the money we paid.",1,1
"Our tour group was prearranged to arrive at 2pm, but none of our rooms were ready for us until after 3pm.  The air conditioning to the whole building was broken.  The lobby was hot and stuffy and so were all our rooms.  We ran the room air at full blast for six hours and it did not make a difference.  In this room which was above 90 degrees the only bedding for Paris in June was a winter-strength comforter.  The hotel and room looks nice on the surface but all of the rennovations have been done with the lowest quality materials, and they are already breaking.

I had read the reviews and spent a lot of time researching hotels before choosing Mercure.  We had stayed at a Mercure in Toulouse a few years ago and were pleased with the hotel another reason to book. As we entered  the hotel the reception area looked good...staff checking us in we're very professional.  Our room was on the 10th floor and as I walked along the hall to our room the area looked very run down and needed a paint job.  I hated the room..carpet looked old and room was very tired looking. The bathroom area looked like prefab modules.  The toilet is in a separate room and you have to go into the shower room to wash your hands.  Can you imagine the germs on the door of the bathroom.  The shower room is tiny and the complimentary toiletries are very poor quality.  There,2,1
"We heard some good reviews and decided to book a hotel in Mercure Eiffel Tower as the location is really good! We booked the Privilege room with an Eiffel view and paid a premium for it, BUT, disappointing to say, now.. at 7pm Paris time, we are still not checked in despite check-in time being 12pm-2pm!!!  Katia at the front desk was extremely rude and had bad attitude and was not sincerely apologetic about the delay and informed us repeatedly that it was due to guests checking out late from the room and also because we wanted the room with a view!! So, I pay a premium and because of it, cannot check into my room.  Not a good start to our vacation in Paris!   I hope the general manager does something about this and give front desk staff proper training!   I do not recommend this",2,1
"I was really looking forward to staying at this hotel BUT was very let down. Staff at check in were NOT friendly at all and even tho when I booked I asked for a room with a view of the tower we were told we had to pay an other 60 euros for that room. Yes the hotel is modern But the rooms are very small. There really isn't anywhere to put 2 suitcases. The bed was comfortable but so close to the wall you had to walk sideways. The shower was fantastic as was the toiletries. Was nice to have the toilet separate from the bathroom but it was a tiny enclosed type of room. There lifts had a problem so we had to use the service lift after standing waiting for 10 minutes. Would I stay here again NO, staff are to rude.",1,1
"My boyfriend paid $190 euros for this hotel for one night we stayed in a privallage room. It really was not worth the money. Where to start....... the hotel states it has a car park online but no where does it state they charge $28 a day on top of the expensive rooms. The view of the eiffel tower was a shambale. We had a massive hotel in front of it, so you could only see half of the tower, which i must state would be seen from a long way. The hotel in front of our room had windows smashed and looked a right dump, not what you expect to look out and see when you pay them prices. We paid extra for a dressing gown and slippers to only recieve one set, when we had booked a double room. The rooms provide coffee but the pods were all decafinated coffee ( you get six) and then only",2,1
"What lingers on is the good breakfast, otherwhise this is very matter of fact. The bathroom is also small and the miniscule toilet is set apart.  I had to move to the Pullman across the street after two days as the Mercure was fully booked. The Pullman is much better. Life is rather short, remember.",2,1
"This is my very first time to visit Paris. We have booked 2 twin room in the same floor as I have 3 friends traveled together. When we checked in to the hotel, they informed us that they have run out of Twin room and give us 2 rooms with King Size bed and even worst we were separated in 2 different floor. They promised to change our room to a Twin room next day. However, they didn't give us the room change and denied the promised they made without apologize.How rude is this staff. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed before.",2,1
"This hotel very well resemble a chic and elegnat style. With most hotels in Europe, I notice that the finishing work in the rooms is not quite complete, like baseboard issues or cracks in the walls. This hotel (at least our room) had none of this. Additionally, both the lobby and the room were quite modern and its just looked inviting for me. As with most European rooms, this is was small as well but nothing out of the norm. I had only one gripe, and that was with the staff. I used to be an Accor Club gold member and so I expected a little bit of a higher standard of service, expecially since I paid the full fare for the room (not the one you would normally pay on expedia or orbitz). When my wife and I arrived, we actually arrive at the wrong Mercure Tour Eiffel, and I decided I",2,1
"Long story short, I booked a two night stay through Expedia and when i looked at the confirmation 5 days prior to my arrival in Paris i noticed that dates were two days off.  When I called Mercure and Expedia neither business would help me.  It was a simple problem with a simple solution to move the reservations two days ahead, and I would of gladly paid the difference, and there was availability.  I was shocked at how inflexible the staff at Mercure were to help a potential life long customer who travels to Paris quite a bit. I ended up paying for the two nights even though I didn't use the room.  If a big hotel like Accor feels like this is a fair policy and treats people like this it's a shame.  I would recommend staying at the Eiffel Saint Charles which is down the street",1,1
"A pretty disappointing hotel and I don't think management are trying to improve from reading other comments on Tripadvisor.    First problem: rude staff.  From giving incorrect information to me about my Le Club (loyalty) benefits - missed out on upgrade and other freebies - through to failing to confirm whether breakfast was included, in general the staff just didn't care.    Second problem, the hotel is dusty and dry with awful air conditioning.    Third problem, the water is dreadfully hard and actually irritated my skin - and I live in London so believe me I am used to hard water.    Four problem, there is just a depressing lack of energy in the hotel.  The staff, the decor, the building are all just tired and dull.  Final comment, although it is lovely being next to the",2,1
"Basically, after a minute stepping into the hotel, I felt disgusted.  The service was terrible.  I had done my homework before choosing Mercure, and they sure did dissapoint.  I was expecting one free breakfast a day, which was promised by the hotel manager, which I did not receive and instead was told that it was a mistake. I also was expecting a bath tub in my room, and when i stepped in the room, NO bathtub.  The A/C did not work and the room was boiling in the middle of the night, which I would have to open the hotel window only to get ambulance sirens, and people screaming at 3 am in the morning.FUN. When i asked for directions they sent me to the wrong places each time. I asked how much car rental was, and the clerk said, very expensive, around 300 euros a day.  I went to",1,1
"Stayed at this hotel in October, 2012. First time in Paris. Booked 1 room, hotel insists we booked 2. Was told by reception manager that he would correct mistake and we would not be double charged. Still fighting bogus charge. Have been in dispute 4 months. Would never stay there again.",1,1
"Hotel is in a great location close to the Eiffel Tower and near an RER railroad stop.  Rooms are clean and the staff is friendly.  However, they redid the rooms about a year ago and removed the desks from the rooms.  All they have is a rectangular table on wheels which you can sort of use as a desk however it is quite small.  Another issue is if you place the rectangular table near the outlets and ethernet port you have no light available for the table. In addition, the only chair you can use with this movable table is a bench with no backrest. Overall a bad room design by a someone who has no idea what business travelers need in a hotel room.  Only room I have ever seen anywhere in the world that doesn't have any deskspace to work on.  Room would be fine for tourists or",2,1
"We felt like we were staying in a ""pod"" - the room was so so so small.  The toilet and bathroom were very basic and very small. My husband and I had to move about one at a time - there was just not enough room for 2.  Whilst situated very close to the Eiffel Tower, the surrounding streets have none of the Paris charm that other arrondissements offer.  For us it was very disappointing and we would never stay here again.  The Accor brand seems synonymous with basic and cheap!",2,1
"I stayed in Mid of December from 17/12 for 6 days. The first impression has put me off especially the way these things happen. 1. The receptionist (a guy) was very rude and he treated me with disrespect. I am very sure that my reservation was there and I had communicated with reservation many times, but upon check out there are no such name. I also was informed that the breakfast was not included despite we pay for it. 2. This guy just felt I am pushing him... I think he must be poorly trained by the Training Mgr or GM. 3. The rooms cleaning are worse that I ever stay. I stayed in many 4 star hotel, but this hotel housekeeping is very poorly managed. 4. Any respond e-mailed to the hotel GM is always answered by the assistant. I believe the Gm must be very busy making money and",1,1
"First and foremost, the Hotel is situated in a most superb excellent area, just behind the eifeel Tower, and simplicity to travel to by Taxi, Metro or Public Bus. The area is one of the best residential areas in Paris, just near the Rue de Suffren. having said that, time to move onto the hotel itself. Rather modern and glamorous from the outside, indeed quite inviting.  The receptionists are useless, incredibly lazy and treat guests with disdain, rather like idiotic fools, and enjoy making guests wait for some service. Bring an egg timer, so that you know when to boil over! A room card is pushed over the counter and hey ho, off you go to find the room. For those that suffer allergy from dust, or have sight problems, you will find out the detriment now. The rooms are dusty,",2,1
"The staff were simply miserable and in the little contact we had with them they were abrupt and short. The first room we were given stuck of smoke and we gad to request another room. Our request for another room was met with eyes rolling and were left feeling that we were taking up their time. The room we purchased was with a view of the Eiffel Tower and was supposed to be a premium room etc, it was little more than a box.",2,1
"I am a regular business traveller staying in the last month alone at 7 different hotels. This hotel was over our usual budget but was one of the only available hotels for the period we needed to stay, even then we had to book 3 privelage rooms as the standard rooms were all booked. For the price he rooms are small and have no desk or chair, just a trolly type table and a chaise long kind of thing. The room smelt like someone had been smoking in it, and the loo stank of urine for the entire stay. We asked for a taxi to be booked several times and were told it was not possible as they only had one company which was booked. My colleagues key card couldn't open the door every single day and when she talked to reception they said they didn't know who she was, although they had copied",2,1
"I have been here regularly over several years. I use Mercures regularly and this is not one of the best. Mercure Grenelle is much nicer if you get a room facing the garden and its 5 mins walk away and nearer the metro and with helpful staff. This hotel seems to be mainly frequented by tour groups. In consequence the staff are either indifferent or rude. To get a quiet room you have to speak to the manager - front desk staff can't care less. Rooms are small for the price. The renovation is garish. But the rooms are quiet, which is a great plus and worth something. Beds and bedding is good. I never have breakfast as there are plenty of places within 5 mins walk much nicer.",2,1
"We have recently stayed at the Mercure and it was suppose to be a romantic 25th anniversary trip, but it turned in to a nightmare. On arrival to the hotel we had no offer of assistance with the luggage. I could not even see the concierge at first, but once I looked around they were tucked in a corner away from the door. We approached the reception desk and were not acknowledged, even though the receptionist saw us. She proceeded to pick up the telephone to dial someone, even though she had the opportunity to say ""I will be with you in a moment."" We had booked a privileged room, which was very expensive and mentioned on the comments that it was our 25th anniversary. We were expecting something very special. Well our hearts sank when we saw the room. It was very small and it was",2,1
"Very modern, clean and close to Eiffel tower.However, Lack of interest in the customer and his needs as my mobile phone has been stolen from the hotel lobby at the presence of surveillance cameras but the hotel staff did not show any interest and informed me that they are not responsible for the theft and could not investigate the matter without a warrant from the police in the early morning as the working hours for the security of the hotel ends at nine o'clock in the evening. It was possible and better if the hotel crew showed more interest to the issue and start investigating through their own cameras, but unfortunately they didn't do anything at all other that saying it was not their responsibility and that they can not do anything about it. I think if I was from another",2,1
"The hotel is ok and the location is by the Eiffel Tower. Subway and train stations are within a short walk. We had problems with the breakfast we paid in advance. Some days would be what we paid for (in the individual room), somedays in the collective room (a cheaper version) for groups of tourists travelling together. There's a renovation going on in some rooms in some floors. I'm travelling with my family (wife and baby) and today we're woken up at 10 AM with the noise of hammers and drills. Called the manager and he told me ""There's nothing we can do"".  The hotel and its staff said or did nothing: no warning in advance, never said ""we're sorry"" and no new offerings. I made a video IN the room where you can hear the noise and the disrespectful attitude of the hotel's manager.",1,1
"The best thing is the location.We stayed there for 3 nights. We made a reservation with months of anticipation asking for a room with a view to the Eiffel Tower, but when we got there the room wasn't available, it was given to other people that came for the automobile fair, so we got a view to another building,very disappointing!!! When taking a shower be aware of sudden changes in temperature,extremely cold ,then extremely hot, very stressful!!! Because there is not a decent shower curtain or a glass door big enough to stop the water from the shower, be prepared for lots of water on the bathroom floor, ask in advance for additional towels, you'll need them!By the time of checking out, we were charged for services like laundry and breakfast, but we never got those things, so be",2,1
"and this for 220 Euros per night. Reception and check out was inefficient and slow. Breakfast was ok, but this is just about the only positive mention about the hotel. The rooms are tiny (that I can live with) but the bed was extremely small and not longer than 1,85m, which is tough when you are 1,90m and your feet are hanging out. Loveless, slapped in furtniture, instead of a nightstand a small table on wheels. I travel a lot, both business and pleasure, but this ranks among my personal 3 worst hotels I have stayed in. Add insult to injury, a hefty room rate that to me indicates the company is just milking this hotel and has no desire to make it a nice place to be in.",1,1
"We chose this hotel because we had to go to Paris in August, and the hotel had air-con. Yes, it had air-con, but no it did not work. When I asked if there was a problem, the receptionist said it was hot outside. Well, that's why I wanted the air-con to work effectively!  Room service was poor, too.  The rooms are very small. Think Travelodge, rather than 4 star, and you may not be disappointed. OTOH Travelodge charge much less.  Location-wise, this is close to the Eiffel Tower, but it's a long metro ride to anywhere else you are likely to want to go to.  On the plus side, our room had been renovated, and there is a small garden in which you can take your breakfast.",1,1
"I would not stay here again. U can hear ur next door nieghbors every move, I could hear a girl blow drying her hair like it was in my room, I heard there every word they were saying , the bathroom smells like everyone pisses on the walls, and when you put up the don't disturbed sign the maid still knocks on ur door, and when they clean your room they don't pick up the trash at all they leave it on the ground. The front desk service was nice and helpful. That's all I have to say nicely about this hotel. the food is completely over priced!  It's a don't stay here from my experience!",2,1
"What a hotel on a stone throw away from Eifel Towel. Things have to improve a lot as there are in a stage of renovation but a great disappointment as they take for granted small things.  Being staying for 3 nights and from day one the remote control of my tv set did not work so I took it to the reception and later of the day got it back still it did not work. Call reception the next day and they promise to send someone up................but till I check out the person still did not show up  and I did not have the remote control. This tell much of a hotel caring and dedication to their service, I leave you all to decide what conclusion is as this happens to you, small matter to consider about if you want to stay in this hotel.",2,1
"If you are looking for a 4 star hotel this is not it.  It is at best a good 3 star, with limited service. Negatives are poor housekeeping, who did not leave us any towels on the second day.  Bathrooms are module type, small toilets, with plastic walls.  Bottle water is only provided on the day of arrival. No bell boy service.  Lobby toilets require a key to access them Breakfast is good and kids eat free.  Location is very close to the Eiffel tower.",2,1
"I was really excited when I booked this hotel 2 months in advance for my July visit to Paris.  It was my family's first time visiting Paris, and I thought this was going to be a great hotel close to the Tour Eiffel. I wanted our stay in Paris to be relaxing and memorable. Unfortunately, that was not the case with this hotel. It says 4 star, but I don't know whose standards it follows?   When we arrived, the concierge was friendly and helpful. We checked in at 12, (because check in- is at 12) They told me our room was ready and it would only be a couple of minutes. 15 minutes go by and we wanted to check on the status of the room. Usually we are very patient people, but that day I had made plans with a friend that lived in Paris.  The concierge says ok sorry just a couple more",1,1
"Arrived for the 12 noon for checkin only to find our room will not be ready until 3pm. We left our luggage and returned at 6.30pm only to find the floors in our room not cleaned, hair in the basin, the kids bed not made, 2 towels for 4 people, fridge not restocked, and privilege items as part of the package paid for not provided. After making a complaint housekeeping came to clean the room.  Could not have a proper shower as the water turned from extremely hot/cold throughout a shower and had to be careful not to get burnt. The hotel is quite run down for a 4 star hotel and in desperate need of a bit of paint and refreshing.  The only good comment about the hotel is that it was close to the Eiffel Tower.",2,1
"I am a gold member at Accor hotels so usually choose Mercure / Novotel for our visits. In general, I was disappointed by the standards in comparison to other Mercure hotels. This hotel is overpriced just because it is 3 minutes from Eiffel. We booked at 220 Euros per night for a privilege room which doesn’t offer views of the Eiffel or anything decent.  Pullman is a better option at a slightly higher price, which is actually better-positioned to see the Eiffel. We went during Bastille Day, so enjoyed the fireworks at night from the top floor gym which was the only good thing.  The standards maintained by the hotel are not up to the mark: 1.	There was a dirty ‘sock’ from a previous guest 2.	Leftover used tea bags 3.	Hole in the duvet 4.	Only one piece of bath robe / slippers",2,1
"We arrived at our hotel at noon (our check in time) and were asked to return at 3pm.  The hotel did offer to hold our luggage for us.  We did some site-seeing and returned at 4:30, only to be told that a room was still not ready for us.   In fact, there were a number of people in the lobby in the same situation as we were.  (Some were offered free drinks as compensation.  We were not offered anything.)  As check in was to have been at noon and we had already left and come back - and as we had been flying all through the night - we asked to speak to a manager but this request was not honoured.  We finally received a room after waiting a bit longer.  While most of our room was clean and bright upon arrival, the toilet room had not been cleaned at all and was quite disgusting.  In",1,1
"I was expecting a good quality 4 star hotel instead was very disapointed with this property. Its at best a two star hotel. The check in process was business like and getting to the room was an experience due to the odd configuration of the elevator floor selection buttons, being on the outside of the elevator, so if you step into the wrong elevator you have to go to its selected floor no way to select the right floor without getting off. The  room was very Euro pop with bright purple everywhere.

Very small bathroom with only a slippery shower to use and a very small toilet that had musty smell all day. Coffee machine that made a loud noise and kept dripping over the sides and only two small milk sachets each day and the bottled water and orange juice was never replaced in the fridge from day one.

We were left waiting for 2 hours for our room, and the staff were not the least helpful at all about it. They said 'half hour, half hour' many times, and their answer to our questions were ""i don't know?""  Other than the front desk staff, the Bell Boys were really great, nice and helpful. The rooms were clean and the design is modern, but the Front Desk staff really spoils the whole experience. I would not recommend the hotel to anybody until their front desk staff change their attitude.",2,1

The only thing of a 4 stars was the overpriced rooms.  Rooms were very small with no desk, no chair, very small area to hang your cloths, crappy small TV, no mini bar.  Entrance of the hotel was littered with debris.  Front desk employees wear pins that supposedly let you know what language they can communicate but it was funny to see the couple a front of me trying to engage in spanish with the receptionist that could not understand that they wanted to make reservations for the restaurant.

We then asked, can we just get the key, which she reply, ok, your room is ready. The room was ok only, definitely not 4 stars, maybe a cleaner 2 and half star. No bath tub. Would say is probably equal to a hotel 81 in Singapore.",1,1

This one is a lot lot bigger, but i don't think that's an excuse for the 24 hairs (oh yes) i found in the bathroom of the first room i checked into - really grim.  I then discovered hairs on the bed, and a bit of tissue by the phone, crumbs on the carpet, along with a used staple, and some thick red thread, and this was before i'd even been in the room a minute or two, and i realised the fridge didn't work when i took out some of the complimentary water.  Oh and the toilet wasn't spotless either.  So I asked to move rooms.  Unfortunately the replacement room had hairs in the bathroom too.  But i just washed them away, as there",2,1

Taking shower is unpleasant as the temperature can't be controlled... :( Internet connection is not an issue as they provide free wifi. There's also a work station on the ground floor with 2 computer and a printer. Staffs are generally friendly. It's great to visit and do some shopping in Paris.

When discussed the matter with reception, they just said they have started the remodeling and picture shown is just a room sample in future.

Als the front desk was kind of rude - at first they checked us in a room that was specialized for disabled people (Showers located in a low place) and the hotel staff were insisting that you can take shower in this room !!

Having already committed 870 euros for two family rooms , staff insisted on another 600 to upgrade to reasonable rooms.

We had 2 night stay at the hotel and although the location was out of this world as its close to everything the hotel was a disappointment of note!  They had a conference group in and it seemed that they could not cope with all the guests. I think normal guests felt neglected and even at breakfast chaos rained as people where scrambling for tables and once you had a table you had to scramble for food if you where lucky enough to find any on the buffet. Paris was an awesome destination but this hotel will not see us again.,2,1

Upon arrival we were greeted by what we perceived to be a warm and inviting lobby. It was -6 centigrade outside and the storm blizzard that hit was finishing its thaw so pretty much anything would have looked appealing. After approaching the front desk and apologizing for not speaking French and asking if they spoke English, all in French btw, we spent the cab ride over there learning how to say that one set of phrases, we headed to our room. Let me preface the following statements by assuring you that I am what we call high class white trash. All I need are the bare essentials; I am not a pretentious elitist who needs every detail to be perfect.",2,1
"The hotel had for sure the best location in town for us.  The proximaty to E Tower was the best.  The short walk to it was just the best.   The hotel itself was very poor by saying this I mean the cleaniness of the place or lack of it was so dissapointing.  Although we could see some cleaning team in the morning all we saw them do is standing behind our door and do nothing or perhaps listening to our conversation or plans for the day.   The morning staff with the black lady was so lucking in customer service.  At check in or any other time there was no conversation or even an eye contact a short yes or no.  The gentelman in the afternoon was great really helpful.   Our TV was broken and we had to wait for someone to come and fix it, to turn it on was a pure luck.  This was",2,1
"Hotel is under reform, with many rooms under reconstruction, and many noises. There was no warning at the hotel site or at the front desk. We only discovered that later. Too bad for ones travelling on vacation and want to wake-up later, as the construction works start aroudn 9 a.m. We had some problems, for example, with the room safe, that the hotel took two days to say that they were unable to resolve. Everything we asked for, they say they would resolve in a few minutes, but were unable to comply.",2,1
This hotel is 3 star at best. We were traveling with our 13 year old daughter sleeping on an extra bed in our room. The first night it took four requests to reception and until 1030 at night before we were provided with a doona for the extra bed. Tea and coffee supplies included paper cups which were not replenished and an extra not provided. Room servicing left a lot to be desired. Bed was very soft and hammocky. Good location but in pretty bad condition and one lift out of service for the duration of our stay. Give it 3 stars at best.,2,1
"The hotel location is perfect for both business and leisure.  The metro station and RER station are very close and convenience. Also hotel guest go to Eiffel tower just 5 minutes walk.   But all rooms must be renovated (even the superior room). The furniture is very old, the bed's comfortableness is not enough for the long flight passenger. The shower facility needs a change of new style.    Only the lobby and bar are the modern style.",2,1
"460 Euros for 2 nights for a small room which had obviously not been re-decorated for years, with dirty walls and large bits of veneer missing from the bathroom door.  Single beds were too small. Breakfast (which we did not take) was Euros 20 p.p.  We chose this hotel to be near friends staying nearby, sadly.  During our walk around the city, we saw numerous small hotels that were about the same price but a world away from this hotel.",2,1
"I don't usually make a concrete recommendation, but in this case I must say that if possible, avoid this hotel.   I am excited to be in Paris. It is truly one of my favorite cities. I was in New York City last week, and had an excellent stay at a Holiday Inn Property. No frills, but also at a no frills price.  Here are the details:  1) The elevator system is insane. It took me two trips to figure out how to use it. I was not alone in my endeavors. The buttons are OUTSIDE the elevator. When you press the call button for your floor, it blinks a cryptic message about which elevator will convey you to your floor. Even with this ""fancy"" system, I had to wait over 5 minutes for my elevator.  2) My colleague arrived to a stinky room that was masked over with Febreze. Febreze in a hotel",2,1
"I was at the 10th floor appeared to be a VIP floor!!! I learned from my letter of complaint that the hotel will be completely renovated in 2012.  During my visit, there was in my room :  paint damage, broken wall corners, seat burned by cigarette... More difficult to accept : the room was not clean : many pieces of foot nail and small pieces of chocolate were in the middle of the room (I saw when I moved to table to work) Apology letter and some miles received for apologize are not worthy of  Accor and Mercure Group The staff is very very friendly what is not always the case in Paris",1,1
"Great location near Eiffel Tour but they are undergoing renovations so we heard drilling and hammering loudly in our rooms from 9am to 5pm. It was so loud on the 5th floor, we could not hear the receptionist on the phone when we called to complain. They moved us to the 3rd floor and it was only a little quieter.",2,1
"The website lists this as a 4 star hotel with air conditioning and the price is reflected as such. The lobby is beautiful. Apparently some rooms are of 4 star quality according to the head of house keeping, but not the wing we were in. There were cracks in the plaster stains on the carpet, one room smelled terrible and the other the AC did not work. We did not stay and when we went to the desk to tell them they would not let us go and argued about us paying them for day use of the room at $140 per room. They would graciously only charge us $140 for one room! No way. I would not recommend this place at all or go back.",1,1
We where part of the Traflager Tours Group & re named this hotel THE SUFFERING HOTEL! The staff where rude the rooms where so small & no view of the Eiffel Tower (as we thought we would) just an office block & because we where part of a tour we where not allowed to eat in the breakfast room with the other guests we where put into a room next door with appaling food compared to the banquet the other guests where eating we actually felt like 3rd class citizens.They even had blockades up to stop us from entering the nice breakfast room.Yes it was close walking distance to the Eiffel Tower  & some lovely restaurants but dont bother asking the staff where a market is or a good restaurant they dont know. We did go & check out the Pullman next door & if I was going back Id stay there,1,1
"Stayed here for just 1 night as i took my husband for his Birthday as a suprise. With only 24 hours in paris we wanted to get started as soon as we arrived. We were told we could check in at 12 but we arrived at approx 10.15. No problem, we could put our suitcase in a room and we went for food. Returned at 12.30 onlt to be told the room would now not be available until 3pm. NOT ACCEPTABLE!!!!! We asked if they had a room we could use to freshen up and get changed in as we had been travelling since 7am and was told by Victor - who was also very rude, that this was not possible.  After emptying half of our contents of the suitcase in the main reception so we could change I asked for the Manager. As a 4 start hotel this was just not satisfactory. It wasn't exactly cheap either!!",1,1
"Our family of four traveled with a Trafalgar group and stayed in this hotel. Staff was rude, unaccommodating and the rooms were terrible! The air conditioning never cooled the room. It was cooler outside than in the room itself. The windows to our rooms did not open so we got no relief there. Was told ""non"" when we asked about the air conditioning. Our entire group complained and nothing was done. We were segregated at breakfast as well. We had runny eggs and yogurt that was going to expire the next day. They other patrons had the works. Asking for cold milk for cereal was a disaster and even had a manager ignore the request one day and tell us no. Rooms were small even for Paris. Free Wifi was great but certainly didn't make up for the poor service, hot rooms and bad food. Both",2,1
"Good experience: thnx their office for printing out my coach tickets and on-line chk-in pages, while we're checking out. Free wi-fi. Bad experiences: coffee packs and creams not replenished, need go out every morning see maid's trolley is in corridor and ask. So as tissue paper inside toilet. Telephone can't get through.",2,1
"Room was small, no iron, phone was broken and grumpy staff.",2,1
"I am used to Mercure hotels being higher than Novotels in the Accor pecking order, but this one was worse than any 3 star Novotel I have stayed in. The bedrooms, although badly in need in of refurbishment are adequate, but the service from staff is poor. If you book into this hotel you will have to fend for yourself. For four days we were ignored by staff, failed to get room service and got no more than the Gallic shrug from reception. Luckily there are some good supermarkets and patisseries just around the corner selling wonderful bread, croissants and tartes. I did not spend a penny more than the cost of my room at the hotel. Location is close to the Tour Eiffel but therefore a distance from everything else.",2,1
"This hotel was a beginning and end point for a Globus Tour we were on.  We arrived to a great lobby thinking this would be the standard throughout...we were very wrong.  Our room was up the back of the hotel, with the hallway walls all stratched, drity and plaster falling off....our room was not much better...expected small for Paris but not shabby.  Returned after our tour for another 5 days personally paying middle to upper prices before we left Australia and again were placed in a very dodgy room..in fact the hotel cleaning staff were staying in the rooms in our corridor.  Front desk very unhelpful with transfers and information and you were treated very poorly at breakfast...after staying in many hotels over a 10 week holiday with no complaints...we would not recommend this",2,1
"We went to Paris in May and stayed in this hotel. Despite of being a Mercury hotel, it was a terrible choice. First of all, at the moment we entered the room, we could sense a very BAD smell, really AWFUL, because of the bathroom, which had no window. One of the nights I barely could sleep. Beside of that, the shower was constatly changing the temperature of the water, from TOO HOT to TOO COLD. I tried to change rooms, but the answer they gave was that they were without any rooms left, so they would send someone to fix the shower. Of course it didn't solve the problem. The staff didn't speak English very good, and was not helpful in almost none situation. I do not intend to come back at all and do not recomend to no one.",1,1
"You cannot beat the location of this hotel if you want to be close to the Eiffel Tower and the Seine River. The staff is rude and hardly understands English. The rooms are dingy. Hotel has some construction going on and the noise from it radiates through the hotel. Do not try to take an afternoon nap, as it is presently impossible with the noise from the construction. I have stayed here before and had a bad experience. I only tried it again because I do love the location. Guess I need to stay elsewhere or shut up about it.",2,1
"We stayed at room 1135  from 9 to 11 May 2011 as part of our Trafalgar tour. We paid EURO 120 to upgrade to the 11th floor so that we could have a view of Eiffel Tower from our room. We reported an incident to front desk where the light bulb in the shower room fell from the ceiling to the floor. Imagine if we were in the shower! We could have been electrocuted to death! The duty manager initially refused to take any responsibility and was defensive. After I raised my voice louder at the front desk, he finally promised to refund our upgrade room charge to our AMEX card. We have sent two emails to the hotel but no one responded. We are so disappointed with the hotel and will advise all our friends not to stay at Mercure Eiffel in France, because the hotel staff promised to refund",1,1
"Beware first impressions - the pleasant lobby is a stark contrast to the dirty, run-down rooms.  The first room was filthy, so a second slightly less dirty room was reluctantly provided.  Complaints to the staff regarding the state of the rooms are clearly so commonplace they simply don't care.  The Pullman next door is infinitely better value for less money (moved there after one uncomfortable night).  AVOID THIS HOTEL.",1,1
"Bad airconditioning, very bad beds, needs remodeling.  Poor business center without a printer so couldn't print boarding passes.  Somewhat inhospitable staff.  Poor views. Not a bad location but I won't make the same mistake again.",2,1
"Fantastic location and great, modern and clean ground floor of the hotel, hosting the reception and the restaurant. All the rest of the hotel is an aged, worn out and often dirty junk. The room we got and paid Euro 350 (2 nights) for (Number 114) was in a terrible shape: 100 years old, dirty carpet, all furniture worn out, door frames chipped and repainted, walls smelling with tobacco (this must have been a smoking room for last 50 years) and a great look out of window into a junkyard with open rubbish containers. I immediately demanded a room change and in 5 seconds got another room (1203). Not as dirty and smelly as the original one but still difficult to believe to be found in the location like this. Avoid.",1,1
"Very dissappointed with this hotel. We booked it through Lastminute.com as a top secret hotel. The trip started positively when we arrived early and the room was ready and they allowed us to check in - the positives of this stay ends there sadly. We went up to our room and the decor of the floor/level we stayed on was dated. On entering the room the decor again was also dated, the room itself was VERY basic and the carpet was ripped where part of the door was clearly dragging on it. I have stayed at Travel Lodge in the UK and this was much worse than that. On the way out we saw an a4 piece of paper that said they were currently rennovating floors 9/10 - excellent! I was surprised that nobody advised these rooms were being ronnovated, both on booking and once we arrived. Would",2,1
"We were greeted politely and in excellent English by reception staff and shown to our room by the porter who was both polite and helpful as well as fluent in English. The room was small (which we expected for central Paris) with a bathroom and separate toilet. The room was quite tatty and bathroom had mould on the tiles and cracks on the ceiling - certainly in need of renovation. The location of the hotel is extremely convenient. This is its only selling point in our opinion.  We booked our trip and prepaid our trip through an advert in 'The Times' newspaper in the UK via Driveline (AA Getaways). The trip included Eurostar journeys from London.  On day 2 of our stay, we realised that although our room had been cleaned, the separate toilet had been missed. So no toilet paper and",1,1
"We decided to go with Lastminute's 'top secret hotels' deal and were very unpleasantly surprised when up came this 'business' hotel for our purchase. Not good Lastminute!   The night before we stayed in an amazing hotel in Paris for the same price. The hotel was a very traditional Paris affair, simple beautiful, quirky and came with everything you needed including free wi-fi.   The Mercure is mundane to say the least. Our room was tiny, furnished cheaply, badly and needed a total refurbish and deep clean.  But the worst part was the toilet, which I can only describe as a room that has never been in contact with deturgent. It had a pungent smell of urine- as did the ladies' toilets in the lobby. Very strange.  Picture frames in our room were broken, the windows filthy (inside and",2,1
"As we were traveling from point to point, we were only going to be in Paris for one day and night. We would be arriving at the hotel between 2:00 and 3:00 in the afternoon, which is generally accepted to be the natural check-in time around the world. More importantly, we had pre-booked the hotel four months before we would be there. Even though the entire trip was for pleasure, I used my corporation's travel department. I was assured that everything was set at the Mercure Paris Suffren Tour Eiffel. In fact, not only did the travel department recommend it, but a friend also recommended it.  The hotel is a few minutes from the Eiffel Tower and the north-facing rooms have great views of this Paris attraction.  We asked for a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower, and we were assured",2,1
"I'd only stay here again if it was really cheap. It's not too far from everything, but there are far better locations in France.  The first room they put us in was awful. The non-smoking room reeked of smoke and there was a light bulb flashing on and off like in a horror movie. We persuaded them to change rooms for us, but we had to move to a room with two single beds. There went the romantic weekend in Paris!   The service was pretty bad. The one good thing about the place is it's an easy walk from Chamade Cafe, one of the better restaurants we've been to in Paris.",2,1
"Walking into the stylish lobby, I was exicted about our first Paris trip.  The woman at the front desk checking me in was quite stoic and the greeting in the restaurant was more of a ""shoosh get out of here, we don't really want to serve customers until 10:30pm. (quite early closing time for a Friday night).  Definitely not how one would dream of being welcomed to Paris.  The biggest disappointment is the core service that this hotel is offering--the area of accomodation.  Apparently, the maintenance dollars are spent on the reception area because when the elevator doors open up, worn, spotted carpet, walls with holes and unfinished plaster patches, scraped paint and wall paper quickly inform you that this place has seen little care.  Note, this is not a historic building, so it",2,1
"Check in was 12.00 noon + 2 hrs. When we finally got our rooms. The room I shared with my wife had been freshly painted and gave us a headache. When told about this at reception we were told that some perfume could be sprayed to get rid of the odour. Finally, we got the assistant manager who moved us to another room. After all that, my son moved to his room which had to be changed as it stank of cigarette smoke. We finally got setelled in our room at abou 4.0 pm. There was only one machine serving drinks. There was a cue to get a drink. People did not know how to use the machine. They were emptied quite quickly and guests had to wait while it was being refilled with coffee for example. The tables were wobbly and the bacon and sausages were some of the worst ever tasted. On the",1,1
"I have stayed at the Ibis in paris last year in October and the room they gave us differed vastly from what was advertised and we paid for . We complained and the let my friend and I stay in their penthouse room (hardly) near staff rooms on an un-named floor room was good but when we went out we came back to find red wine spilt on our bed and our money stolen with stuff everywhere, the staff at the hotel where very un helpful we had to force them to call the police ruined my holiday. The thieves had forced the lock which was evident no appology from hotel they just did not care. On the 8th October 2010 at Mercure Paris Suffren hotel Tour eiffel my family was staying there and I went to visit them their camera was stolen from the room whilst my uncle was in the shower and my aunt",1,1
"I have stayed at this hotel two or three times before and each time I find the Hospitality TERRIBLE at this hotel. The staff is always very rude and they are certainly not customer oriented. The reason I keep coming back is only because I like to be in close walking distance to the Eiffel Tower and the Seine River. If it were not for that, I would NEVER stay here. Reservations are never honored as made. (That has been my experience) You can expect to never get the room you reserve and must settle for whatever they want to give you, or leave. I think I would fall over if I ever got a ""Hello"" or a smile from anyone at this hotel.  Ok, now that you have read my rant over the rude staff...I will say the room is small, but adequate if you don't plan to spend time in the room. The bed",1,1
"This is a four star hotel, which made me truly wonder what the three and two star hotels in Paris must be like. It's just OK, it's near the Eiffel Tower and convenient to the Metro, the room was reasonably clean, but that's it. The lobby was drab, the restaurant felt like a cheap cafeteria, breakfast was a minimal effort at best and the room was small, in poor condition and just a bit depressing to be in. Even after a short two night business trip I was glad to leave. I really wouldn't want to have to try and enjoy it for a holiday in Paris. The room service menu was uninspiring. The free Wi-Fi was OK but the paid ethernet service was just awful.",2,1
"We arrive and the lobby wreaks of perfume. After suffering by traveling the subway system that was out of order in some places which required dragging our bags around hell & creation, we get to our room. It has two tiny little beds. Lets just say far from what we ordered and paid for. The air conditioning is feeble and barely works. The TV was not straight forward, nor were many things. After three trips to the front desk because the telephone is broken, we decide we've had our Fill of  the rude treatment at the desk. The fridge is empty, there is only ""public"" ironing, no coffee maker in the room...NOTHING! This place is a bloody rip off. And last but certainly not least, if you require any type of adaptor (we own every other kind of adaptor known to man) , you are required to",1,1
"The staff at the hotel was rude, unhelpful and uncooperative.  We stayed 7 nights, paying for a executive room.  We had a standard room, with no housekeeping/room cleaning 3 of the 7 nights.  From the time of our arrival, no one ever greeted us.  The lobby stunk of fried fish every afternoon, the breakfast bar was never replenished properly, tables were dirty, food spilled on the breakfast bar but staff never bothered to wipe or clean up.  No maps available, there is a concierge desk but it is not staffed.  To get any assistance, one needs to stand in line with guests trying to check in or out.  Many times although we stood in line to wait our turn for assistance from the frot desk, the staff ignored us.  Unfortunately the staff has no concept of customer service or",2,1
"I booked this hotel on a last minute basis and had limited choices near the Eiffel Tower. I chose Mercure because of the positive experience I had with other Mercure hotels I stayed in before. I booked a suite as these were the only rooms left and paid an arm and a leg for it. We checked in before noon and the man in reception happily announced that our room was ready. To our dismay, upon reaching our room( the room was too tiny to be called a suite) the bed wasn't made up, wet towels were hanging in the bathroom and it seemed that the previous guest just left. Since we only had one day in Paris to bring our son to the Eiffel Tower, we left and on the way out we told reception that the room they gave us wasn't cleaned yet. They were trying to give us the excuse that cleaning is",2,1
"Against better judgement  I stayed in this hotel after having bed bugs in a prior visit (bites on arms and legs...caught and showed manager). I was assured that they had ""renovated""  the hotel. The lobby is new but the only new in the room was a  flat screen TV and a new duvet. The ""non-smoking"" room I got had burn holes all over the carpet, the bathroom was moldy, dirty and peeling. The dirty old blanket was up in the closet in case you might want to snuggle with a bug. I hope you look at the pictures and reconsider booking at this hotel. There are others in the area if you need it for work like I did. I went to one just down the street.",1,1
"If you are BLACK, get back.  The woman that checked us in on September 17th at 12:00 treated us like I never saw an animal get treated.  Extremely racist me and my friends felt.  Watch your BILL!!! Me and my friends paid for a package that included breakfast.  We were told the day before leaving when checking things to be sure that we had to pay.  The desk clerk, Jerome(Great guy...only good employee there.), checked and saw we had already paid for breakfast.  He said, check to see with manager in the morning of our last day to be sure it was straightened out.  I did.  The manager assured me it was handled.

"The location of this hotel is great... if you don't mind being with 20,000 other tourists. Other than that, it was pretty lousy. We felt like we were on a bad cruise ship, because the rooms and hallways were so so small. The staff was nice and helpful, but the hotel is outdated and NOT 4 stars. If they changed the rating and price it would be much better.",2,1
"On arriving at this hotel it has a great large, clean well presented reception area, however once we got to the room I was a little disappointed.  Small room (expected in city) seperate toilet to bathroom but toilet was smaller than an airplane toilet which was decorated with chipboard wallpaper and the toilet roll holder was broken which meant that it kept falling off the wall, bathrrom was small but clean and acceptable. Most hotels now provide free wi fi, they charge for it which I thought was a bit tight considering its 4*.  The hallways and rooms are very dated and tired, although they were clean.  The breakfast was included and was fine, nice restaurant and buffet which was mainly continental, as expected. Overall we got a good deal for the hotel so can't really complain",2,1
"What a disappointment! We had planned a short break in Paris and thought to indulge ourselves in a four star hotel.  We have stayed many times in Novotel hotels and felt we knew the Accor chain well.  We didn't!  This hotel, although very conveniently located, doesn't offer four star facilities. Our room was small (barely room to pass each other) and the decor very shabby. On the plus side, the bathroom and WC were very clean as were the sheets on the bed. During our stay the hotel could not offer any cooked meals (only cold food) and the breakfasts were the worst we have experienced in over 30 years of holidays in France. Who would have thought there are croissants which are more flabby than those in some British supermarkets? There are signs that the hotel is being",2,1
"I was very unimpressed with this hotel. It was close to the Effiel Tower but that was all it has going for it. Under major renovation, this place is very inconveinient. The rooms very small however clean. I asked the maid to stay OUT of my room but she came in and cleaned anyway. The staff here seemed unused to having many people to help.  Now I know why.",2,1
"This is not a very good hotel.   I had a standard room, which was unrealistically small for 2 people.   There are no ironing boards or coffee makers in the room.  There is a small, narrow hall on the top floor with an iron and ironing board.  When I tried to use it, the iron spewed out brown fluid that would have stained my shirt.   There is no ventilation in the bathroom, and the climate control in the room was almost non-functional.  There is no concierge, and the woman at the front desk acted very put out when asked to call a local internet cafe to see if it was open (the hotel's business center is closed due to reconstruction).     I will not stay here again, this place doesn't deserve my business.",2,1
"So much for the romantic weekend in Paris.  After fighting round the building works to get in the back entrance of the hotel we arrived at the reception.  Staff really friendly (only plus point).  When we opened the door to the room there was no resemblance with the pictures on the website. Room was tiny, grubby and depressing. Separate toilet was no more than 3sq ft, bathroom was average. There was a view of the Eiffel Tower although there was a building obscuring more than half of it.  All in all there is no way this hotel was a four star hotel.  I would rate it at a 2 star.  We eventually checked out and went next door to the Pullman (which was in our eyes a four star hotel) and enjoyed a fantastic two days for 5€ more per night. Now that was a real four star hotel.

"Both my fiance and I work for a travel company where we stay all over Europe in the summer so we can definitely recommend some good hotels and when I go back, this is the LAST place I would ever stay in Paris. We left our room for an hour the night before our flight to go for a brief walk and recap our summer, when to our surprise we came back to having a number of our belongings stolen. The staff were not helpful, the manager failed to contact us for several weeks and overall, the hotel did nothing to replace our laptop, ipods, and backpack which had a number of personal items from our travels. We were EXTREMELY disappointed with the hotel itself, let alone having this awful experience. We have seen a number of things go missing in hotels by hotel staff members over the past 3",1,1
"Well where do i start the lobby was clean and check in pretty quick, then got to our room which was very small and the bed well body hairs everywhere on the  bed blanket and on the bed sheets!!!  The bathroom was clean enough but my major problem was that we were on the 13th floor and you can freely open the large window there are no safety locks on them and its a very dangerous situation when you have kids beacause the airconditioning system is one of the worst i have ever come across so in the summer time you have no option but to open the window hence the severe danger if you have kids in the room so beware!!!  Also no iron in the room just one iron for the whole hotel on the 13th floor in a dingy little room  Location is good in relation to the Eiffel Tower!!!  Dont eat",2,1
"This hotel is in a good location although you will have to walk a half mile or so to get a good restaurant.  Room was worn, reasonably clean, but terribly hot! Window wouldn't open so all you could do was sweat. Desk personnel couldn't change a 50 euro bill  but would gladly convert dollars to euros. When asked to call a cab for our party they referred us to the nearest taxi stand .  Breakfast buffet was so-so but poorly attended.  Seating was inadequate.  Had to wait for tables.  I hope to return to Paris one day but will NOT be staying here!  This hotel was my only negative experience in Paris.",2,1
"Booked this hotel, away from all the sites, for it's advertised services.  Fitness - pool - sauna... Only to find out that they are doing large renovations, which resonates throughout the whole building. Fitness, pool and sauna are privately owned - have nothing to do with the hotel.  Therefor they charge full price of € 20 for all their patrons. room are ok but not excptional. Would not stay here again, better alternatives available.",2,1
We stayed here for 4 nights. The location is in great proximity to the Eiffel tower and subway stops. The tiles in the bathroom shower however were covered with a black mold. When we asked to have it cleaned only the second time they attempted to clean was there a slight difference. The hotel front desk was unwilling to let us switch rooms so we were stuck with the moldy shower. The beds were uncomfortable but if you come in when you are very tired you will not notice. We had a breakfast buffet included which was good for breads and fruits in the morning. The hotel restaurant is reasonably priced and if you order the ribeye it is enough to share for 2 people.,2,1
"We booked a family room and had informed in advance that we had a child, still the room given to us was so amazingly tiny (it was a family room they claimed) that only a family of midgets could have fitted in. For my daughter, they got a rickety, broken folding bed and said that they have none other, hence the 3 of us (hubby, me & daughter) cramped up in the small queensize bed. Also for some unfathomable reason, the toilet was separated from the main bathroom and was a small, claustrophobic space right next to the entry door. Breakfast was ok and location was good. But I'll never stay here again because of the very small room, uncomfortable beds and strange toilet.",1,1
I’m sure there are real 4 star hotels in Paris but this is not one of them even though its very own website states it is.  I grudgingly suggest 2.7 star although I am always a little peeved when hotel websites exaggerate.  We stayed here as part of a bus tour and found the place to be 'oh so' ordinary.  The candid hotel photos on Trip Advisor give an excellent indication of what the hotel is like (thank you to the contributor).  Rooms whilst reasonably clean were depressingly plain and basic.  The shower (which worked well) and the toilet were in need of refurbishment.  The computerized lifts were a real trick……particularly at busy times.  A couple of times we just gave up waiting.  The hotel breakfast was OK…..6/10.  Staff seemed OK.  Some rooms do have a view of the Eiffel,2,1
"Stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. It's clean and the rooms are OK (nothing spectacular). Breakfast is allright. The toilet in the room is divided by a wall into 2 rooms with separate entry, a cubicle with the WC, and a bathroom with a sink and bath. A strange way to split what would have been a nicely-sized toilet.  Room service was not very good, the maid failed to take away the 3 shirts I'd left for pressing on my bed with the filled-in cleaning form on top of them (there was no laundry bag). So obviously they were not ready for the following day...  When they did take the shirts for pressing they returned them folded, in a box, wrapped in cellophane as if I'd just bought them. Very fancy but very impractical: obviously the shirts were creased again, making pressing a bit",2,1
"My mom and I stayed in the Suffren 3 nights with a Globus Tour group. The hotel does have a nice location real close to the Eiffel Tower with several restaurants close by, but as others have said, the rooms are very tiny, which I hear is typical for most European hotels, but with two big suitcases and a bevy of souvenier bags - it gets cramped quickly. The beds were terrible - twin and hard as rocks. Most nights all you had was a blanket, no sheet and with the AC turned all they way down - IN OCTOBER - it was still hot. The food was sketchy - warm milk for cereal, soupy mass produced eggs - most mornings all we could palate was a croissant and coffee. The hotel itself was clean and the staff very helpful. If you are traveling on business, it's fine, for pleasure I would look",2,1
"Stayed here  Nov. 26 to Dec. 1 , 2006  this is not a four star hotel. We had stayed at the Hilton next door twice on priceline and that hotel is a star and two better even though both are 4 stars on paper. Rooms are very very small with two small desk chairs, and their just is not any room to move about.  It does have a good location. We will not stay here again and will not bid for this area on priceline.  We paid 115 a night plus priceline charges.",2,1
"Spent 3 nights at the the Mercure right by the Hilton at the Eiffel Tower (Bir-Hakeim on the 6). Not bad for sightseeing as far as Invalides, but you'll have to take the RER (train, as opposed to metro) to get to anything more exciting. The hotel was clean, but that was its most endearing attribute. There was no Concierge, we got a TERRIBLE restaurant reccomendation. For a business hotel, this one loses points because there was no internet in the rooms. You had to go down to the lobby (after 6pm) to hook up to their wifi. The elevators are reeeeeally slow because they're on some ""efficiency"" system. Breakfast was nice, but it was not included. Would only return to the Mercure as a last resort. Try the quartier St. Michel instead!",2,1
"This has to be the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.  They do not know anythign about customer service at the front desk.  We arrived a little early at the hotel and wasn't allowed to check into until after 2:30 when our paperwork had said 12pm check in.  What really got me ticked off was how they were so rude every single time I asked.  The ""double"" room was TINY and dirty with two TWIN sized beds.  The maid cleaned our room eventhough I had put the ""do NOT disturb"" sign outside BOTH the hotel rooms before I had left for the day.  And even after I complained proceeded to open our room without knocking THREE times the next morning even when the ""do NOT disturb"" sign was outside.  Some sites claim that this hotel is FOUR stars.. when it should be ZERO stars.  I think I've had",1,1
"I stayed at this hotel with my family, rooms are dirty, view horrible, people very unfriendly to americans.  Please do not go here if you expect a Hilton. I have a very bad impression of Paris after staying here. The breakfast buffet was its only saving grace.  Go to London people are alot nicer and city is cleaner.",1,1
"I am a consultant and travel every week staying in different hotels.  In Paris I have stayed in much better hotels for half the price.    For the tourist, I would say if you want to enjoy the charm of Paris, that can be anywhere and the this is not central to anything except the eiffel tower (although everything is central in Paris).  Charm in Paris is not in a large multistory concrete building  For the business traveller, paying that much for a hotel that charges extra for internet access and breakfast, has a lousy gym, a single iron for the entire hotel in an ironing room and very average rooms, it is simply expensive and poorly equiped.",2,1
"I stayed 1-night - the small room (1030) was worn, the bathroom cramped & the toilet was located in an adjacent seperate cubicle room (I could not confortably use this without the door being left open it was sooo small!!!!).  Breakfast was a €20 buffet (not incl in room rate) & the bread/croissants were definately not what you'd expect in France - very poor.  Coffee was stewed being self service out of an urn.  The hotel's in a good location - but there are a lot of other hotels in the area.  This is a €170 hotel that I will not stay in again.",1,1
"Tacky hotel, terrible tiny room.   Reminded me of a sleeper car on the Bangkok-Nong Khai train in Thailand.   Good location after we got more familiar with Paris. It was our first trip so we did not know our way around. The area around the hotel was very nice and interesting but the room was nothing more than a mediocre place to sleep in a fabulous city.  Front desk staff was obviously overworked and not real interested in the comfort of their guests. But I also understand how some tour groups can get under the employees skin. I saw one tour group guest eating food that was on display. And when the waiter told het to stop, her tour guide started screaming at the waiter.",2,1
"The Mercure is listed as a 4* hotel but the services and rooms are at best at the 2* level.    The good:  Location  The bad: Understaffed front desk, No concierge, Unimpressive lobby/bar,  Cheap furniture, No business center/intenet terminals, 25 USD for 2 hours of WIFI, Underequipped fitness center, Small rooms-even on the European standard, ONE ironing board for the ENTIRE 400 room hotel!   I have stayed at this hotel for a total of 4 weeks on business.  I have yet to find anything good about it except for the location.  The front desk is always so understaffed that they seem bothered with you when you are asking for directions, help with the metro (subway), colleagues room numbers, etc...  The service is not great but probably not the fault of the overburdened employees.",1,1
"I stayed at Mercure Suffren in Paris in Otober 2003 with my wife and in-laws. We prepaid through Priceline. When we checked in, the receptionist clearly said to us that breakfast was included in the price, so for 6 days we ate breakfast at the hotel. When we check out, we were shocked to find out from a different receptionist that there was a charge for breakfast. to the tune of $560 for 6 nights. Our protests were met with only denials that they ever said that breakfast was included. They claimed that breakfast is never included, even though a look at various websites marketing the hotel shows that breakfast is included in the package.  As for our stay, the rooms barely accommodate the beds. The elevators kept malfunctioning, and our refrigerator and telephone kept breaking",1,1
"Stayed here 2 nights as a part of a group tour, very crowded as other tours also stayed here . Short walk to city centre, room was dirty - blood on door and blanket. Breakfast was available not the greatest but surpassable.",2,1
"If I could give less I would. They are liars and thieves. Booked via Agoda and would not honor reservation, requiring a booking of another room for double the cost that is offered on booking sites. Then proceeded to not allow me to cancel existing reservation since I didn't want to be scammed by them. Wanted me to keep existing reservation and book another room. Would not accept another solution, zero. Agoda made it right after 2 hrs talking to them, which was also terrible. They refunded my money and gave me credit for future reservation. Hotel didn't seen sorry, just rude.",1,1
"A personal object (without much value) went missing from my room and the receptionist didn't do anything about it! She only called housekeeping and told me they said they ""didn't know anything about it"". Didn't even apologize.  The air conditioner is weak and doesn't word well. The shower is two headed but only one of them works (staff didn't do anything about that either). Wouldn't recommend it in a million years. Absolutely horrible.",1,1
"Don't believe the other reviews. Here's the truth! I stayed for 10 nights. The first night was so noisy I could not sleep as it was next to street. I requested in advance a quiet room. But the noisy room I got also had a bed 6 inches too short. Though I attempted changing rooms 3 times, it was all the same. All the rooms had a lot of black mold. The beds are hard as rock, not up to date, too short in length, old and in need of replacing and updating long ago. The shower head never stayed up on its own always resting waist height. The elevator broke for days while I was there. Staff was good, breakfast bar good, BUT MANAGER IS A JERK! This hotel chain DOES NOT GUARANTEE YOUR STAY. They are not honest either and GETA ROOM DID NOTHING even though they knew in advance about my",1,1
"The room we were in was very bad, there was a distinct smell of cigarette from the room. Bed was OK.  We didn't spent much time in the hotel anyway. The staff were ok. nothing special about the hotel apart from the fact that its location is good. there are train stations nearby (both underground and above). So moving around was good. The elevator was really really small (which is pretty common in Europe),   Also some other people in our group said that they enjoyed the hotel. So maybe it was just our room that was bad.",2,1
"One of the worst hotel in europe compare to price. There are 100 of option available at this price. It was like a guest house. Tiny rooms, small bathroom, small bed and that too very uncomfortable. You can not even put your baggage in the room. Thin gallery and most of all hopeless breakfast. Avoid it .  You can't stand while taking bath.no pastries, no cakes, no crossent s in the break fast. I am still trying to forget it. 500 meter away from metro.",2,1
"Stayed there for business trip, horrible room, small, the worst is the bathroom need to jump over the toilet to get in the room, just awful.  one of the worst I have been in Paris.  Would not recommend at all.",2,1
"Second visit to Paris this year, unfortunately had booked in advance the week after the atrocious killings. Possibly the smallest rooms ever and without a fridge!!  Breakfast was very average with not much meat selection, only ham and cheese. No eggs hard French bread. Rather disappointing and unnecessary to be so tight a mon avis.  Only hotel because of the location (Restaurants and night life) and I would certainly not go back.  Fire alarm went off for about 10 minutes at around 2am to make matters worse.",2,1
"I stayed here with a group of 31 adults and students. I was the group leader and had access to multiple rooms in this hotel while checking on my students.   Location:  The location is actually good.  Avenue du Maine is a pleasant street with a grocery shop nearby.  The most convenient metro stop is Gaite, an approximately 10 minute walk straight down Maine.  The area is clean and safe. The rooms:  ""Too little"" insulation.  I could hear every conversation in adjacent rooms.  I could hear people walking down the hallway and opening doors.  I could even hear someone's cell phone vibrating on a hard surface somewhere in an adjacent room.  The AC was good. The bathroom:  ""Too little"" space.  In my room (109), I could not sit on the toilet straight since my knees would hit the wall in",2,1
"We did not pre-book. Room was tired , dinner set meal only was appalling we were the only group in the restaurant.breakfast was full we had to wait for a table for 4 but first had to clear the previous occupants crockery as no staff were there.  We pointed this out on paying and  the lady told us she was not in the room as she was washing up shortage of staff perhaps? I do not expect to clear tables on holiday maybe the hotel should be only coach tours .",2,1
"I am very unhappy with Campanile Maine Montparnasse Hotel. I went to Paris for the first time ever for New Years. I decided to choose this hotel. My friend and I stayed for a total of one week. First, they put us in a room with no Wifi and a very small bathroom. You had to stand up in order to wipe yourself off after using the toilet. Considering that the lack of Wifi was a problem, they moved us to a new room, 2 days later we told them about our problem. The new room still had a problem with Wifi. Now, regardless, that wasn’t my problem. I let that all go since well, I was in Paris. My problem is that during my stay at the Hotel, over 200 Euros went missing from my wallet which was hidden in my suitcase. It was my emergency money, so that wallet always stayed in the room,",1,1
"We stayed at this hotel for five days. Location is ok, about two hundred meters from metro stations. Rooms are small but it is two star hotel. Over weekend was crowded for breakfast because eating space is to small. Other days was ok.  Cleanness is very good. Elevators are old and small. We enjoyed our stay but did not spend in hotel to much time.",2,1
"After paying in full at check in I was told the room would be ready “in 20 minutes”. Rather than standing in a cramped reception we went across the road for a coffee (husband and 2 small Kids). On our return we were given our keys.. go to our 1 bed apartment to find dirty towels on floor of bathroom and a suitcase and food wrappers in bedroom !!! We go back to reception and complete chaos. No one knew what was going on or who was in our room. 4 ladies in reception making many phone calls and looking intently at computers and refusing to give me any information, apologies or assurances. My 2 children extremely tired and becoming increasingly upset. After 2 hours from (from start of check in) manager finally appears and confirms no hotel room available for us. I had to frantically",1,1
"I paid for a room with a view of the Tower Eiffel, (as I saw in the picture of the room) but neither from the bed or the table, I could see that, I needed to go to the balcony to see it. The option of breakfast was terrible and expensive. The fire alarm rang in the corridor for nothing. I stayed in another hotel days before that was much better and much cheaper. I don't recommend it to anyone. it doesn't worth the price.",1,1
"We arrived early after travel difficulties, and were not surprised to find our room wasnt available early. We were exhausted and had an evening appointment, so getting in at least on time and having time to clean up and rest was important. After 4 hours wait, knowing we were available, and well after our room was supposed to be free it still wasnt ready, they simply coldly said ""no, its not ready yet, try again in a half hour."" No apology for running late, nothing. When we finally got in later it was not the twin bedroom we reserved, and the bedside lights didnt even work, infact one was falling off of the wall. The bed was very uncomfortable. There were no USB chargers, and for one person to read in bed all the lights had to be left on. The curtain was hanging with several",2,1
"My interactions with this hotel was far from favorable. If you want to stay somewhere hospitable, avoid this place at all costs. I called ahead and asked for my reservation to be moved by a day because of flight delays that put me back a day. After the hotel attendant confirmed that there WAS room and he’d “do all that he can to help” but because I booked through Booking.com, I’d have to go through them. Which is okay! He tried guilt-tripping me talking about Booking.com’s commission fees -which has nothing to do with me. And so I asked Booking.com and they said they’d be happy to ask the hotel considering that me arriving in the country a day late was out of my control. The same hotel person denied my request, even after taking my money and confirming they have room. Go",1,1
"The staff here are so rude. We were waiting to talk to someone at reception & the person who was on duty was on a personal call, saw us waiting and didn’t get off their call to help us. We gave up and walked away.  On another occasion while staying here, we wanted to put things in the safe at the front desk. The person on duty sighed and said first of all that there was a safe in our room.  We explained that online reviews from people on TripAdvisor  said they had things stolen from the safe in their rooms. We were told by the receptionist this never happened!! The breakfast at the hotel is terrible - don’t waste your money. It was poorly set out, the person duty in the breakfast room didn’t explain how things worked or where things were. We arrived 30 minutes after it was",2,1
"I am a Citadines lover and stay in their hotels around the world. The Tour Eiffel location however, was not up to par.   The front desk staff were very rude every time we encountered them, especially at check in.   I would consider the location good but not great. We aren't big on public transportation, instead more about walking and the hotel was not great for walking. The bakery across the street with some of the best madeleines i've ever eaten made up for the hotel itself. The walk to the Eiffel tower was around 10-15 minutes and it was pleasant enough. There are some decent enough restaurants nearby.  The room was loud, very loud. We heard everything and everyone into the wee hours of the morning. The bed was uncomfortable. Not my favourite place to stay, sadly",2,1

工作人員雖然服務周到，但酒店本身的裝潢以及一切設施都在廉價汽車賓館（還要是過時的廉價汽車賓館）的檔次。入住的人都應該是 1）沖著巴黎鐵塔景觀（只在最高的 6/F 和 7/F）和， 2）酒店的便利性而來的吧?   訂房的時候，我提早 18 日前 email confirm 並註明我的額外要求。雖然所分派房間可能受到多個因素影響，但我最後成功獲分配到頂層風景最好的一間轉角房間，擁有 L 型露台，一間可在不同角度，日與夜都能夠完美地擁抱巴黎鐵塔的房間!!!!!  切記，大前提是要在合適的時間提出合理的要求!!! 若你於 1 星期前提出，而該房間有其他旅客的話，酒店可能無法配合。若你兩個月之前提出，酒店亦沒有可能空著那房間等你。不過，你可以自訂酒店一日起每個月都聯絡一下酒店，這樣人家也可以有充分的時間為你預備。  得到酒店方面的配合，讓我就算只待在房內都能夠拍照拍到最後一刻才捨得出發去已預約的餐廳吃飯，酒店的員工當然功不可沒。在巴黎，比這間酒店更用心，更願意去服務旅客的酒店工作人員並不常見。  地點方面也是一流，3 條地鐵線，另加幾條巴士線（因為怕被打荷包，我很多時候避而不乘地鐵出市中心 1 、2 區而選搭巴士，搭巴士去老佛爺也安全方便）。酒店旁邊就是佔地兩層的中型超市，斜對面馬路更會在星期三、六有中大型市集（約有 40 多個排檔和地攤。另外 15 區因為不像其他區般擁有特色景點，所以地鋪租金相較其他區段低，這卻造就了一個食肆林立的美食創業區域，十分值得饕客探索。  酒店的設施雖要更新嗎? 陳舊到不能，絕對需要。需要更有效率的升降機維修公司嗎? 我住的 5 天當中其中 1 部升降機都封著，正在維修，絕對需要更換另一間維修公司。房內設備需要大更新嗎? 房內所有東西都像是 90 年代一般平價汽車旅館的陳設，沒設計沒風格，絕對需要大更新。,2,1
"Had read great reviews about this Hotel/Apts,  yes, it is a good location, near the Metro and the Eiffel Tower, and good neighborhood.  But, the purpose of hotel when you are traveling is a starting point and ending point to your day on vacation where you can recoup and refresh yourself for the night or the next day.  This property is very ""dated"" and could use some ""refreshing"",  the carpets are worn and the walls and door ways could use new paint and touchups.  We were there for 6 days, there are two ""tiny"" elevators, one was out of service our entire stay, it's an 8 story hotel, so you either wait in queue to go into the elevator or use the stairway!

The reception lobby looks modern but that's where the modernity ends, you get into the lift and then you come out of it and almost feel ""did i just get into a time machine that brought me back 10-20 years back"".  You come out of the lift and it does not matches the modern looking reception at all. the gallery has a really shabby carpet, old doors / walls (paint going off from a lot of places). you enter the room and you find living room size to be quite decent but then you enter the actual bed room - and it just finishes even before it starts. the room is small to the extent of being claustrophobic -",2,1

Other good point, the bed was comfortable.

"The best thing about the Citadines Tour Eiffel is the location. From the Hotel you can walk to The Eiffel tower, hop in the metro and go all the way to Eurodisney. Very convenient indeed.  Check-in was swift and well done. The staff member was very polite and supportive. We paid the city tax in the check-in, which is normal, but we had to pay city tax again on the check-out. Why? Customers should not have these unpleasant surprises.  The room was plain and simple, not like the nice photographs in the website. Worst, the room was not clean with dust everywhere. When we asked to have the room clean, another surprise, the cleaner service is not free. You have to pay to have your room cleaned.

On hotel.com the check in says 2pm but when you get there they tell you it's 3pm but the rooms still weren't ready 3 hours later. Stepping off a plane, you want to put your bags down and freshen up right away but couldn't' they not venture back out in the heat. When one of our two rooms were ready, we all went to that one room which was hot. There seem to be a problem with the A/C.

However, the shower head is messed up. You can't even use it properly as it is either too pressurized or too weak.   I also had a hard time finding my room as there were rooms hidden from the main hall -- behind a door. So i had to look at everything as I initially thought the passage was a fire exit. Not to mention I was dragging 2 very large and heavy luggages and a cabin sized one.   There was no bell boy to help me. It was a struggle, really.   There is also no room service, so If you're too lazy and tired to get up, might as well just sleep with a hungry stomach.   I booked for 4 nights initially but now I am",2,1

He then said he could not fix it today since he was alone but ”maybe tomorrow”. We also asked if they could fix the safe, we had to ask three times before they said they could not fix it.

"The location is great and given our taste for modern/chic decor, this hotel seemed like a great fit. But we had two terrible experiences during our short stay of three nights.   First - Upon check in, we were placed in a tiny room...tinier than we've ever experienced before in Paris at this price point. But, hey, that's Paris, that could happen. The problem was that the toilet was in a separate tiny ""room"" - smaller than an airplane lavatory. But to use the sink, you had to step out into the bedroom, close the toilet door behind you, and then enter a separate adjacent door to the bigger bathroom with the sink and shower. Plus, in an already small bedroom, you have three separate doors - entrance door, toilet door, bath door. Again, okay, fine. It's bad design, but that happens.",2,1

The room layout was very strange, but nice (need to cross a sitting room and around a corner to get form the bed to the toilet).  When we checked on a Saturday, it became very obvious that the view ont eh website was NOT from our suite.  We needed to go out on the balcony and look over a side wall to get a partial view of the tower.

The difficulty in booking the room directly was impossible and had to use a 3rd party site, as well as the staff more interested in the money than anything. The high price of the breakfast which was not attended to was not worth it. The location was great however.",1,1

Breakfast on our first day was chaotic, with staff just wandering about and food items running out, no milk, little bread, no bacon. At least the coffee was good. Bar was usually empty and soulless. We chose Melia hotel because we have stayed in many Melia hotels and the standard is normally good - not this one, this is by far the worst Melia hotel we have visited and would never recommend to anyone. Staff need to be taught how to smile and look after clients, send them to ME Madrid",2,1
I’ve experienced too many problems in just 2 days stay. First of all it is unacceptable for such type of hotel to not have hot water for the shower. I understand that technical problem can happen but rooms with problems should not be given to guests. Then very loooong queue to take the elevators because two of them were out of service. It is a very nice location but several maintenance issues spoiled my stay in this hotel,2,1
"Let’s start with the good, The hotel is nice, clean, and the rooms are a decent size. The best part of this hotel is the location! Just a brief walk to the Eiffel Tower and it is literally around the corner from all the shopping one would ever need!   However!!!! The room was ridiculous in terms of the toilet being on the complete other side of the room. If my husband or I used the toilet, we had to walk across the room to the other side to wash our hands. The shower and sink were not in the same room as the toilets. I’ve never seen such a thing! Also, they have a hand bidet in the toilet room; but they don’t proved a towel. So if you wash yourself with the hand bidet I guess they want you To waddle with a wet bottom across the hotel room to get a towel.  The concierge- sorry to",2,1
"I was excited to stay here because the location is awesome! But, they claimed the A/C was turned off and the rooms were SOOO HOT! they ran out of Fans and we had to take a cold shower at 1 am to sleep our first night. They switched our room for the second night but on the same floor. We got a fan by now, but the Wifi and TV kept cutting out. (in this day in age this shouldnt be a problem) They couldnt rectify it and even sent a technician to our room on the second night. We should have been moved again. We were given a discount but it didnt even cover the $$$ on Data we spent;. The Staff was very friendly, but couldnt repair our issues. The location was great but had to go to a cafe for Wifi",2,1
We booked this about 8-10 months in advance. Our ac wasn’t working(long story).This hotel isn’t worth the money and wasn’t that nice for Paris stay. Find somewhere else to stay and have a better time.,2,1
Great location but unfortunately  not much else. Breakfast wasn’t worth the money so make sure it’s included. And make sure the building next door has finished the renovation Not what I expect from them. The one in Barcelona is amazing in comparison,2,1
"I would never stay here again. The TV was broken about 65% of the time. The elevator was broken so you had to take this Barbie doll size elevator - if it came at all. Half the time we just walked down as we got sick of waiting for it. The toilet is around the corner through a door from the shower and sink. The sink is the size of a sink in an airplane. The vanity had no room to put anything. The bed was so hard my husband could not get to sleep at all, and considering that wse paid for an Executive or Premium room or whatever it was called, the bed was like a double - it looked smaller than a double.It was definitely not a queen or a King. There was this funky table in the idle of the room. It was clean and hygienic and everything and the furnishings were pretty and the staff",2,1
"I was in Paris for a business trip from 4-6 July and my usual business hotel was fully booked. When the available options included your hotel and given the good experiences I had in Madrid Melia Santa Ana i thought i should give it a try. It was also the first time my wife and our new born baby join me and therefore we extended our stay until the 7th.  In summary, the experience was the worst I’ve had in a hotel by miles and I have been a frequent traveller for the last 15 years.  Upon arrival the receptionist did not find the booking on your system, although she had exchanged emails with my assistant confirming the booking (and she suddenly found it when I showed her the email - then argued it was for 2 nights rather than 3 although it was clear in the email that SHE herself",1,1
"Good location, old and tired hotel considering it is a Melia the standards are very low in this hotel.  A/C  never worked only warm room, and all hotel was always warm. Main elevator never worked and the excuse was they haven't brought the parts to fix it.  Very unprofessional",1,1
"The location was great. The people at the front desk were very helpful and attentive The restaurant service was excellent. The rooms were so hot at night, you could not sleep. Also, be prepared for a very firm mattress,even by European standards.",2,1
"I had gotten in touch before my booking, over 2 weeks ago to discuss the fact that due to unforeseen spinal injuries; my doctor had deemed me unable to travel. Not only have both Hotels.com and the hotel completely ignored my email, I have been in pain and the severity of my situation has only been amplified by having to fork over £1000 for a trip I couldn't take. I have been a frequent visitor to the Melia hotels and I have never had such a problem, so I booked it even though the only option was non-refundable. This is a scam; you have just shown complete negligence when conducting your services and your priority is in scooping up our money. It is embarrassing and unjust that such a big company is allowed to conduct in such a manner against vulnerable customers. You were very",1,1
"The Melia Tour Eiffel is not a cheap hotel, actually its quite an expensive hotel. It is also one of the most uncomfortable hotels I have ever stayed in. The bathroom is built like a medieval torture chamber. If you have a BMI of more than 24, the toilet will be cramped and uncomfortable and awkward... if its over 30 it will be distinctly unpleasant bordering unusable. The shower requires contortions to get in and out, and the hot water is unpredictable.  I have stayed in a number of European hotels and am well acquainted with their sadistic fondness for hard mattresses, but this one was impressively wooden. We never had a decent night's sleep because every toss or turn was like walking into a lamp post.  This is not to say the hotel does not have its good side. The front desk",2,1
I booked a room and pre-paid for my business partner for him to stay before a conference. After travelling for most of the day from Manchester he arrived to be told that they couldn't check him in as he didn't have my credit card on him.  They kept him waiting for an hour whilst we tried to resolve it - they rang me and I gave authorisation but that wasn't enough.  I then emailed them an authorisation form but that wasn't enough.  I emailed them a copy of the credit card and my drivers license but that also wasn't enough. That was rejected because I had obscured some of the credit card number given that it's not secure to email a credit card number. I'd be surprised if it wasn't illegal for them to request this.  It's hard to believe that in 2018 a hotel like this is still,1,1
"When I arrived they asked for my credit card details in order to get a deposit for the room. Nothing strange, it's a ww policy.  The point is that they didn't make a pre authorization via POS but simply wrote my credit card details in a piece of paper visible to everyone. I complained and they said it's the procedure otherwise I could pay cash the deposit. Long story short I had to pay and asked to talk to the supervisor. She was not there and didn't want to call her. The following day she gave me the same explanation in  such an impolite way.   NEVER EVER AGAIN.... I called my travel agency and we won't send anyone anymore there Forget the place... rude and impolite",1,1
Waiting more than one hour for my check in. Toilet was dirty. Room  smell bad. Wall switch turn tv on and off. Split bed for a couple. On my reservation we had $10.00 back per day as reward and Melia did not honored it. Tried late check out and was denied. I really got upset since they gave us our room late and they only gave us an extra hour.,1,1
This hotel refused to return our rewards points credit even though we cancelled 2 and a half months before our scheduled stay. My wife and I had a health emergency and could not go on vacation. The hotel refused to return calls and emails from Capital One Rewards Center who was acting on my behalf. I would never ever do business with such a selfish and neglectful hotel. They robbed us of our dream and our rewards points for future use.,1,1
My wife and I checked in to this hotel today. Its late night and we can not sleep because the A/C does not work!! We tried calling the reception but they cant do anything about it. The room is clean but really small. The good thing about the hotel was the staff. They were really friendly.,2,1
"Great location. Friendly and informative staff. Room 209 was small but proved adequate for our needs. Did not take breakfast which at 29 euros seems pricey particularly if you plan to dine on wonderful French cuisine  for lunch and/or dinner. Close to metro, bus stops and taxi stand. Easy walk to Eiffel Tower or Champs Élysées. Hope to return to the property at a later date.",1,1
"very bad sound isolation, everything came through from neighbour room. Internet was super slow and unreliable, like I would jump 15 years back in time. Service ok, location rather good but if you stay out long and want to sleep long, go somewhere else",2,1
"Hotel was under renovation what would not have been a big topic if we would have been informed. So we paid the full price, couldn't use the bar/Restaurant and everything else than the room. Everything was dirty, elevators occupied by workers. Then the bed was very unconfortable and if that's not all a whole Shopping bag with clothes was stolen from my room!!!!",1,1
"I recently stayed at the Royal Alma in Paris and while I think I just had a bad experience, the hotel was not worth what we paid for it.  We arrived late in the evening and the person on reception at night was really helpful and pleasant. He was probably the only positive experience we had with the hotel.  As for the negatives:  - Room was very small and although the description says it's a king bed it looked more like a double or queen bed.  - Main problem was that the room had no do not disturb sign and despite asking reception twice for one it was only put on our door the morning when we were leaving. We had a long trip to Paris and wanted to get some rest but were woken up 3 times from various knocks at the door from housekeeping. This is something basic and reception just",2,1
"We were force to upgrade because a standard double room was not big enough to hold a cot. The premiun room was mediocre with 2 single beds and matresses pushed togethed  and two sets of sheets folded in separately. The cot hardly fit the room. Breakfast was not included in the steep price and costed extra each day. View from the window was terrible, facing the back of another building.",2,1
"We just spent 5 nights at the Melia Royal Alma Boutique Hotel & we were very disappointed with this hotel. We had come from staying at a Melia hotel in London where we had a great experience, and so it was even more disappointing to see that the Melia in Paris wasn't as good quality or as good service as its London counterpart. Upon arrival we were very surprised to learn that at best there was only 1- 2 people at the front desk, no formal concierge. The people at the desk were often rude and not helpful. For example we would ask at the desk for advice on where to go for dinner or shopping and they would give us a general answer like a neighbourhood, or they would tell us not to go somewhere as it is full of tourists (we kept telling them we are tourists) or they would",2,1
I just left Melia Royal Alma Boutique to check into the La Maison Favart because it was so bad.  I'm speechless with the service I got from the manager! Do not stay here!The room has really bad dust and possible infection. I broke out in hives and itchiness due to the room. I couldn't sleep because of the itch. I left my room at 5am to the front desk to ask if there is anything they can do. They said they will contact me in the morning. No one did so i went to the front desk and spoke to the manager. She was very unhelpful and didn't seem to care or apologize for me complaints. Finally she promised me to get me a new room in the afternoon but when I came back she already gave my 1 room away to another guest and complained that we didn't clean out our room so couldn't switch.,1,1
"I got to Meliã Royal Alma four hours ago and I'm just counting the hours to leave. I don't even want to wait until breakfast time to write my review as I'm really angry.  When I arrived this evening nobody asked me if I wanted a smoking or non smoking room, so I deduced that the place was tobacco free. Then I took my luggage to the room and left to dinner outside the facilities (the hotel, four star hotel, doesn't have a proper restaurant, only room service).  Anyway, when I came back at around eleven I discovered an ashtray and a box of matches in the drawer so I went to the front desk to ask for a change.  What I hated the most is that, at the beginning, the employee told me that I was wrong and that this wasn't a smoking room! After five minutes he changed the speech telling",2,1
"Paris is very often a busy city. We had to choose that hotel among 2 other 4 / 5 stars offered.  Price was reasonable for location (near Avenue Montaigne) BUT you have to know that rooms are small, decoration is really kitch and below any acceptable level for any international traveller, very dusty (if you are allergic, consider twice !!!), AND :  AC out of order in our room, huge noise of outside AC units (but not our apparently ....) and most of all armies of well organised very hungry tropical mosquitoes ....  What a night !!!! Believe me, just an overnight fighting against mosquitoes.  Also the walls between rooms are thin, so you can participate by procurement to intime games of your young and sexy neighbours.  Need a real refresh and a new strategy to consider hotel",1,1
"Got to the hotel and was told my room had been sold, had to travel a couple miles to another hotel, checked in and my room was a double not twin as requested, when i asked to be moved i was told there was nothing that could be done, my college slept on a sofa for the first night and paid 4star prices to do so, not compensated at all for the hotels mistakes, charged full rates on check out, lesson learnt, this melia hotel is second rate and would be compared to a uk Travelodge, the location was fair although melia made the decision on which district i stayed in, not the trip i planned to have and possibly my worst hotel experience ever, I WILL NEVER STEP FOOT IN A MELIA HOTEL EVER AGAIN AND I RECOMMEND THE SAME TO ANYONE ELSE",1,1
"We stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon, it's located in the heart of Paris, close to every tourist attraction. The lobby it's very nice, the room quite small (average for Europe), there were spiderwebs on the bathroom ceiling, the wallpaper by the window it's full of moss and falling down, the bed makes horrible noise with the metals underneath, there is one long pillow on the bed to share, the balcony you share with other rooms, A/C didn't work, we didn't have hot water to take a shower for one day. You can hear the room next to you, anything they are saying no need to shout. We also ordered room service, they said it would take 15 minutes and it took one hour and a half. Breakfast it's 28 Euros per person and it's pretty simple, service overall it's mediocre. For a four",2,1
"Well located hotel close to all central Paris sites, but don't expect to get much sleep (maybe that's why you are in Paris!).  Hardest bed I have ever not slept on (which makes a change from the usual French sag in the middle bed!).  Breakfast fruit looked very tired, maybe it had not slept either.  And for $250, not exactly cheap.  Otherwise a nice hotel.",2,1
"Stayed in this hotel between Christmas and New Year and have to tell you for the money they are charging it's poor. Very poor actually bearing in mind that while staying in the Junior Suite the bed was missing pillows. Finally got given one with sheet that wouldn't match pillow because they run out. They also did not have twin bed available as they presumed two people with the same name would be couple. Location wise it's not that great either. Although overlooking Seine, Tower etc there's nothing going on around except two really overpriced resturants. There are many hotels in Paris and most of them have charm that is not there in Royal Alma. As per Boutique ... I don't really understand it. There's nothing orginal and different about it. Small rooms, lifts that hardly fit two",2,1
"What a disappointment!  Don't bother staying at this so called ""boutique"" hotel.  There was absolutely nothing boutique about it at all.  It was dirty, noisy, and cheap looking. Our stay went down hill the minute we walked into the lobby to check-in.  First, the receptionist was collating personal documents of other guests (i.e. photocopies of passports, credit cards, etc.) at the front desk for all to see and perhaps steal.  Throughout the entire check-in process, and with other random guests hovering around the front desk area she didn't think once to protect any of the personal guest information that she had strewn about the counter - she even walked away from the documents several times.  Absolutely no security at all.  And second, it took her several minutes to greet us and",1,1
"I fail to see what's so ""boutique"" about this hotel. Boutique hotels usually have something special and different about them - this one is simply a (generally) comfortable hotel.  We had a reasonable room - but the bathroom was a total disaster. The toilet was so jammed between the shower screen and the wall that I couldn't actually sit on it! Even for Paris that's quite an achievement - and a world first for me! The bath was also downright dangerous - neither my partner nor I were able to step into it without slipping or overbalancing.  The room was comfortable - but it was not the non-smoking room the receptionist had assured us it would be - not with ashtrays and matches on the dek, and the small balcony littered with cigarette butts; it clearly hadn't been swept for weeks.",2,1
"This is only a decent Hotel. Service is very very poor. The management have to do something to improve the quality of the service which is indecent. Everybody never smile and seems they want to avoid guests, expecially at the Reception. Hotels like this they consider the guests only for the ones who has to pay the bill and thats all.",2,1
"Where to start...Arrived for our honeymoon and were so excited to be in Paris!  My second trip there, hubbies first.  We were told at check-in about what time breakfast would be.  No mention that it wasn't included.  We were charged almost $70 for a mediocre breakfast.  We complained to the assistant manager and we were told that she would speak to the manager and get back to us.  After 3 days and no word, we were again shuffled to a different assistant manager who basically told us that because we booked the trip on Expedia, we should have know that we didn't pay full price and we would be treated as such.  Which we definitely were the entire time.   Oh yes, and sporadic hot water in the shower.  Always fun to be freezing cold and then scalded the next moment. We were never",1,1
"Decent size room, small bathroom. Staff is extremely rude w/ exception of bell. DO NOT eat breakfast there. We were told it was included and then got a bill for 25 Euro each. 25 Euro for a sub standard breakfast.  We only had 5 mins to eat it they put everything away before we had a chance.",2,1
"We stayed here in April 2019 , the room we were given was not the one we paid for,we required a room with twin beds which were supplied but the room was so small we could not move about safely , there was mould in the shower , when we complained we were told to go to the office the next day and we would be given another room , we did this but the manager had lied to us ,there was no room available we had to wait a second day for the correct room which was then supplied . we will not stay at this hotel again . We had booked in September 2018 , there is no excuse for the Hotel not supplying the correct room We found the stall arrogant and pushy",1,1
"Good area, nice staff.  Luggage hold was a joke, no security, just a locked closet and they give the key to anyone. The luggage hold was self service, there is no checking in or checking out the luggage. Someone could easily steal someone's bag without the receptionist having the slightest clue.  The a/c was broken, 80+ degrees our whole stay.  The water temperature fluctuated cold, hot, cold, hot the entire stay.  I would not stay here again.",2,1
"Horrible service...bad attitude Location of hotel is great, price is decent, rooms clean but I wouldn't stay here again because of the horrible service and bad attitude. I have no idea why the staff work here if they hate people staying in the hotel.  The hotel itself is dingy and outdated and small. Our check in time was late because of a water heating problem. We had booked 3 separate rooms (there were 6 of us) and when we got our rooms, one (mine) did not have hot water.  The lady at the receptionist who checked us in during the day was nice at times and then rude at others. The no hot water issue wasn't a big deal the first day as we knew the hotel had had problems but i thought it was only for that first day. I did not have hot water in my room, the entire stay. I had to",2,1
"For the amount we paid to stay here, was definitely not happy. When I asked why the air conditioner did not work I was told that it would not be switched on until the end of May (the last day of our stay was the 29th) and the staff’s solution was for us to leave our windows open. There was no fly screen and we were the first floor above the lobby, traffic was very loud and car horns were blaring at all hours. Layout of the bathroom was hopeless, the door opened into the bathroom so far that you had to squeeze into a corner to get past it to the toilet.",2,1
"This place was the worst place we stayed in France.  Staff were rude, read something written in French on our voucher and then laughed in face before showing vouchers to others and making them laugh.  This did not set scene for a happy stay.  We asked for an additional towel to deal with leaks in bathroom  and it took over three hours to arrive. We were the first into breakfast and there was no juice available and no hot food.  At least the bed was comfortable even if decor was questionable.",1,1
"Stayed here with my family and checked in was a mess. The staff were not friendly at all and quite arrogant. The bathroom is filthy. Toilet is very small and, i mean, tiny. The room is just not enough for family.",1,1
Just stayed a few days. Been here before - it’s ok usually but they have a bed bug problem (see photo of one) I notified them- no compensation nothing. I will now need to steam all of my clothes and bagage to make sure I don’t get infested at home but they don’t seem to care!!,1,1
"The Peyris Hotel is a perfectly respectable, clean and functional 3 star hotel. However, the staff are completely disinterested in providing anything other than an absolutely perfunctory service. We encountered three different employees during our weekend visit and they all exhibited the same level of engagement and customer service: poor. We couldn’t even get two extra tea bags at 10pm. It’s not that the staff were rude, just that they gave the impression they didn’t want to be there.",2,1
"Our hotel stay was nice. The hotel is very quiet and staff is helpful. Sheets need to be changed more than once a week. This was disappointing as we stayed a full week.  But as we left something went terribly wrong.  Be very wary of cabs to DeGaulle Airport arranged by the hotel. Today, September 19 we were victimized by one of these cabs. Before we left we noticed the cab driver slip something to the desk clerk.  What looked innocent was not. About ten minutes from the hotel, the cab driver demanded 72 Euros. The fare is regulated at 50 Euros maximum. When we told the cab driver that fact he became angry, stopped the cab and threatened to put us on the street in a bad area. Feeling unsafe, we paid 67 Euros and were delivered to the airport.  The cab driver said the hotel was",1,1
"So...this isn’t a “bad” hotel, but you have to be prepared for what you’re getting...and we weren’t. It’s not as centrally locates as you may think and there are few dining areas close by (walking in the rain wise). The rooms are so so so small, and the bathrooms are even smaller (and we are pretty small people). The elevator can not hold two people and two bags together. In all not a bad place, but keep your expectations low...then you’ll be fine.",2,1
"We checked in into this hotel, they gave us a room with a door that's doesn't close. We asked them to change rooms they couldn't, next day they promised to fix the door after we spent all night in a room with a broken door. When we came the next day at night after a long day of waking, Guess What!!! The DOOR IS STILL NOT FIXED. I had to have a conversation with the host downstairs which concluded to us being moved to a sister Hotel of theirs. Me and my wife had to walk with luggage in the streets at 11pm to get to the other hotel. Please be aware of this hotel, the pictures do not look anything close to the reality. The premium suits are horrible, they are just full of BS.",1,1
"The hotel was shabby not chic. Staff was really rude and one guy told us no stores were open for water and wine etc. tried to sell us expensive water and wine. Literally walked two minutes down to next street and there was a 24 open small market with everything we wanted. Evidently stores are open all night all over the neighborhood. Do yourself a favor don’t stay at hotel peyris opera. It’s dim, dark, and a little creepy.  The breakfast looked like a bunch of sugar and starch. Was not able get directions correctly from any staff who spoke broken English.  Also getting in and out of door operated by Non attentive front desk staff was super annoying. There are so many great hotels.   Also advertised as a four star hotel when it really should be 2.5 at the most.",1,1
Most of our stay at Peyris Opera was great but unfortunately the last night turned into a nighmare as our passports and boarding passes got locked into safe at 9.30 approx and nobody could open it until 7:30 but unfortunately we should have left at 6am to make our flight so we missed our flight which in turn cost us more money with no satisfaction from Peyris opera so i cannot recomend Peyris opera as i have tried in vain to ask them for compensation  bu they as good as ignored me .so peyris opera thanks for nothing,2,1
"We stayed 1 night with my girlfriend and the experience was simply horrible. From the moment we arrived the receptionist was rude to us. We payed an extra fee and booked the ""superior room"" and got the smallest room I've ever seen in my life. The toilet was so small that I had to play Tetris with my body to fit in, sorry but if you are a bit chubby or fat you can't enter, Im not joking. The breakfast was simple but good. I just had to ask the waitress to change the milk that was sour and not fresh anymore. I am sure there are so many other hotels to stay in Paris. Avoid this one",1,1
"My little daughter locked our passport in the safe and forgot the passcode. There was no on there in the night to open the safe on emergency. We had to catch 7:30 am morning train and their security guy was only available from 8 am We spent the night to reach the security guy ( with the help of front desk guy- who btw was helpful). Reached her at 5 am but she plainly refused to come and help. Came only at 8 am. We missed our train and had to rebook an expensive train in the afternoon. I understand that losing a passcode was our mistake but any hotel should have overnight emergency services and not leave their guests stranded like this.   Also, we booked taxi from hotel. They charged my debit card an amount of Euro 12. When checked, the hotel had no idea about this. They told me",2,1
"Although the location of this hotel was reasonably close to facilities, we found the hotel itself to be poor.  But the worst thing was the bathroom to avoid hitting your knees on the toilet roll holder you had to sit sideways and the shower was so small every time  you moved you hit the tap and turned it of. I will not be recomending my travel agent to use it again.",2,1
"We came at noon already booked a room in a lower floor (my sister in low don't take the elevators) . We didn't got it , we got another room in 4th floor (she took the stairs instead) . The staff: a lady and a middle aged man were unfriendly and racist. They said ""you arab"" for us because we claimed our room. I hate it.",1,1
"three weeks ago, My husband & I stayed 4 nights, in room 443. When we saw the room, I was surprised, nothing like any of the many & varied colourful pictures published,  Our room was drab (beige walls, brown carpet) pokey, tiny shower, our window overlooked back wall of hotel, doona barely covered the bed. I was disappointed, but figured French hotel standards/ratings were v different to Australia.   Friends arrived the same day and stayed in room 441, they were so embarrassed at how good their room was compared to ours, they didn't want to show us. Finally on our last night, we saw their room. It was lovely, street view, tiny balcony, much larger shower, colourful, good floor space use. - even down to spare blanket and towel rail - in their room , not ours.  In fact contrast",2,1
"Location not too bad although a little out of the way.  Room very small, smallest of our 7 week European holiday.  Bathroom facilities terrible.  Both my partner and I are six foot and over, one person only in bathroom at a time and forget picking up the soap if you drop it in the shower as the shower cubicle would be lucky to be two and half foot square. Also forget about washing your feet as no room to lift your leg and if you try to turn around you either burn yourself cause you hit the tap or have no water cause you turn it off. Breakfast also very basic.",1,1
"Everything in this hotel is tiny! The doorframes, the TV, the bathrooms, the sinks, the rooms, the elevator, the showers - oh god, don't get me started on the showers! Once stood in, I barely had room to move, never mind clean myself. The sliding doors make an absolute racket as well, sounds like a thunderstorm. The fans in the bathroom and toilet (two separate rooms for some bizarre reason) were constantly on and very loud; the only way to turn them off is to totally kill all the power to the room, so if you like to have a sidelight on at night, or, you know, charge your phone, prepare to put up with the noise.    Cleaning staff totally ignore 'Do not Disturb' signs which is annoying when you're working late nights. Every single morning I had at least one member of staff knock",2,1
Worst experience!!!!! Concierge don't speak English! No one helps with tours! Elevator only fits one person and a small luggage. Staff are not friendly. First time in Paris and will never visit it again. Horrible!!!! Location is far from most attractions. Beds were hard and queen size were 2 single beds made up as single beds then stuck together!!!! Pillows were tooooooo soft. We had an attic but kept hitting my head on the low panel ceiling. Breakfast had no atmosphere. Will not travel to Paris again unless you speak French then you may have a chance!!! Dull lighting and not friendly staff.,1,1
"Firstly, the good: the rooms were clean, quiet, spacious and air-conditioned. Reception staff were lovely and the hotel location in Paris is relatively convenient. Price isn't too bad considering I booked quite late and it was for the middle of summer. Breakfast is ok, there could have been warm eggs and toast options.  Unfortunately, the bad: no fridge, no power socket in the bathroom and the double-bed used two blankets made for single beds instead of blankets made for the actual bed size.  But the biggest problem was when staff ignored the ""do not disturb sign""! It was a Saturday morning, we had the ""do not disturb sign"" on the door handle and the door was locked. Yet staff knocked without waiting for a response and then unlocked & opened the door! I had to yell out to stop",2,1
Our room was reasonable with basic amenities. Lift so small only one person plus baggage could fit. Staff were polite. Location is good for nearby restaurants and short walk to hop on hop off bus stop. No hot food for breakfast but continental breakfast provided ok.,2,1
The Hotel is in a good location to experience true Paris life and has plenty of nearby bars and restaurants used by locals. You get what you pay for and we had a small rather claustrophic room up 4 flights of stairs. It was warm and stuffy as the AC was not on and there was no control for the window. The bathroom was compact with an extremely snug 64 x 49cm space to shower! The breakfast was typically French and a good start to the day.  The main tourist attractions are walkable but our advice is to go to the river and use the BatoBus which travels up and down stopping at the 8 main attractions near the river. You buy a day pass and hop on and off as often as you like. Much better than walking\metro etc all day. We went round several times without getting off - you see a lot.,2,1
"Hotel is okay clean  and  in good location but has no security measures my suitcase , travel documentsand passports were stolen by a man that I had seen wondering at lobby for more than an hour it was the day I was leaving the buguagge room was full  and I was told by Hotel Manager Christian to place my suitcase and my family members in  the breakfast room as  breakfast had finished and it had been cleaned for next day within 10 minutes of putting our belongings in the room this man made his way in  and took my suitcase and documents he was so quick  we could not stop him I am very disappointed with this HOtel no ctvv cameras I aproached manager and all he had to say my insurance would sort it out.Well I was stolen in hotel and they should have been liable SO JUST TO MAKE PEOPLE",2,1
"This was the last stop for my husband and I after travelling from Australia to London then on to Amsterdam then Netherlands for business. Our last stop was a few days in Paris for some r&r. Our travel agents chose this hotel as the one we wanted wasn't on their list? We do not have any complaints about any of the other accommodation we stayed in. To be fair, my husband had emailed a few days earlier requesting earlier checkin If possible as our flight would land us in Paris around 9am. The reply was positive that they would try. Unfortunately it did nit start well when transfer was not there to pick us up. We arrived at the hotel approx 11 am. The lady at the counter abruptly said 'we expected you at 10!'  Well firstly any time given when travelling can only be approximate.",2,1
"Were my first thoughts every morning!  I understand that the owners of this hotel take great pride in the decor of this hotel but I found it very bold and a little tacky .  I expect a hotel to be relaxing but that is the last word I would use to describe this hotel.   The shower is ridiculously small-- drop the soap and you will open the door with your behind when you bend over to get it!   Breakfast was bad (no other word for it, it was just bad.)  Just a guess but I think they must buy day old stuff to put out.   Alexander (I think that as his name) at the front desk was GREAT!  He was very helpful, friendly and personable.",2,1
"Thee rooms are clean and nice if you get a large room which means paying over the odds in Paris for an average hotel but if you are unlucky as I was and pay for standard room, You get a tiny small room, no minimum health & safety requirement and if you talk to the staff about it they will respond nicely but wont even move from their desk. My bathroom door was broken and I had nails hanging from the wall - Its ideal for budget Russian community visiting Paris (which are making the majority of the clients anyway) - no for someone coming to relax for weekend or for business purposes. Area is ideal but the hotel service is not - Great thing about the area is that there are so many hotels around at the same price range that can give better stay experience.",1,1
"This was a really bad experience for me. The two twin beds were like one bed. The toilet was in a room that was so small that you couldn't go to the toilet and close the door. Have you ever had to sleep in a room where you have to listen to people on the toilet all day and night?? AWFUL.  There was no room service, awful internet service, it went out all the time. Location wasn't bad but not great. I wouldn't stay there again.",2,1
"The hotel was quite central, close to the metro and buses.  The service was really bad. The night receptionist was unhelpful, give us the wrong room, a single room and elevator not working.  Had to bring heavy language to fifth floor and after complain he give us finally the room we payed for.   The room looks better online then in real life, but for the price it's acceptable.   Breakfast was included and ok, nothing special.   It's just an cute hotel, but sadly that the night receptionist was not service minded at all.",2,1
"Was qtaying in this hotel and must say never again!!   The receptios is so non welcoming , very rude ant cannot be flexible with our demand.  Also, a lack of responsability taken by the girl serving us.   Ask me to pay in advance for the journey- redicillious.      Not reccomended at all- never again!!!",1,1
Stayed in this Hotel during our stay in Paris - didnt get any other hotel because of the Paris Air Show. The hotel doesnt have any proper staff - only 3 people handling the whole property - receptionist at the front desk and the 2 cleaning staff. Very small elevator - big enough for 1 adult or luggage. Shabby corridors. Avoid if you can.,1,1
"SO, yes this can happen to anyone, anywhere...but as my family and I came back into our room after breakfast we happen upon a strange man in our bathroom....long story short the reason why we got our property back was because of our own pat down and hold of the guy.  The hotel NEVER tried to retain the man...and in fact he escaped...hmmm inside job you ask?  Breakfast sucked too...bad neighborhood...We ended up moving to St. Germaine and found a wonderful hotel Relais St. Germaine for LESS than this place...do your self a favor and stay somewhere else...",1,1
"travelled to Paris and stayed overnight at this hotel before travelling the following day to Switzerland.  The first stop over on the 17.7.2011 room no. 219 was ok.  However, on the 25.7.2011 (room no. 328) it was a terrible experience.  The family room (2 kids, 2 adults), the bathroom door wouldnt shut, there was no shower curtain or screen so water went everywhere.  The milk at breakfast was definately off and to finish our stay my daughter found a mouse in the hotel lobby! The area surrounding the hotel is noisy.  We were incredibly disappointed with Paris, and found it to be a dirty, graffiti ridden city and it made us proud to be British for once!  The walk from the Gare de L'Est and Gare de Nord  to and from the hotel was an experience.  Lots of beggars in the street,",2,1
"Staying in a second hotel on a recent Paris trip [See my review of BEST WESTERN Etoile Saint Honore], this one was worse on a few fronts. First of all the room was nicely designed but extremely small and I am not that Big! The location is a little bit quieter and not in the action so if a good night of sleep is important this place is not bad. The worst thing that happened twice during the 2 nights I stayed was the wake up call not going off. I specifically asked for one to get an early start on sightseeing but ended up waking up at 11:30am in my dark room. Having asked the concierge about it, they said the morning attendant forgot to call. The next morning i was leaving on an international flight and said this could not happen again but of course once again they did not call!",2,1
"My cell phone was stolen in the lobby of the hostel. The staff brushed it off, said it was my full responsibility, and didn't even look at the security cameras. A sad and horrible experience. DO NOT BOOK HERE.",1,1
"Minimum equipment, low cost, low quality, noisy hearing other people's door and walking in the corridor. Moreover people are so selfish and egocentric, living like no one else is in the room...finally slept 2 hours...never come back",1,1
There are no real pictures posted on this site of this place. It's it one of the grosses place I have ever seen! Total deception on ever level abs once they have you there abs you see it is a lie of course theft so not give you back your money. Don't stay here!,1,1
"Stayed here 1 night and that was enough. The hostel seemed ok at first, but the area of its location is not recommended. I stayed in a 4 people room, which was very very tiny and additional noice from the road, made it impossible to sleep.  Would rather recommend another hostel if you are staying in Paris.",2,1
"When first walking in to our room we were shocked to find our room was NOTHING like the pictures advertised.  We then discovered there were no towels which we went to reception to hire the use of one, where the lady quite rudely said €2,50 and tried to give us a hand towel.  When speaking to other guests they had the same experience as us.  Then there was the choice of opening the window so you didn’t swelter from the heat but then in doing that it meant you would get no sleep with the outside noise. Even with the window shut it was extremely noisy.  Do not expect towels, hand soap, toilet paper, air conditioning or even a fan.  We thoroughly enjoyed Paris but this really but a dampener on it as we were so sleep deprived.  **we have stayed at a number of hostels and hotels**",1,1
"Me and my two girlfriends chose to stay at this hostel for 4 nights while visiting Paris. On our second night there, while we were out watching Moulin Rouge, someone broke into our room and stole a laptop and other personal belongings. Every window and door was locked when we left for 3 hours. We called the police and they were helpful in filing a police report. They even mentioned that the door handle seemed faulty and un-safe and that it probably wouldn’t have been hard to break in. The next morning we checked out and demanded a full refund for the 4 nights so we could go to a different, safer hotel. The staff was super unapologetic and only would refund us for 3 of the nights. The manager seemed to not have one care in the world. I would never recommend this place to anyone!!",1,1
"It was a problem with our booking, so in stead of one long booking, we got separat bookings for each night of our stay. When we arrived we were told that we had to check out each day of our stay, and check in again each afternoon. This really affected our stay in Paris. The second night we were moved to a hotel due to “technical difficulties”. We paid the same price, but the hotel room had a lower standard than what we originally had ordered. The hotel room was dirty and there were holes in the linens. When we check in at the hostel the next day, it was clear on the girl in the reception that there hadn’t been any technical issues, so they probably moved us away du to overbooking. It is weird that they chose guests in the middle of their stay, and not someone on their first or",1,1
"This hostel was such a let down!  I paid for a private double room( lot more than some hostels) and it didn’t have a bathroom... even on my level, had to go up stairs or down stairs to find one toilet that was always occupied or twice covered in vomit,  The wifi was awful, and we even had a note in our room saying no wifi in the room so come down and chat And use the wifi which was NOT on the website, and the lift was broken during our stay so we had to carry our suit cases up lots of stairs.",1,1
"We booked in a group and emailed beforehand to be placed in the same room if possible. As it's a busy hostel, it's understandable that these requests can't be met. One of the check-in staff was unnecessarily rude and threw a tantrum about having to rearrange us. We kept clarifying that it was fine if not possible but that person seemed more adamant about being emotional than solving anything.   There were also bed bugs present. When informed, the staff (same person) was apathetic, which gives me the impression that this isn't the first report of bed bugs they've had.   Amenities wise, it's a decent hostel. Note that the lockers don't come with locks, you'll have to bring your own.   The location is great and very central but can't make up for the poor service and terrible bed.",1,1
"The only positive thing with this Hotel is close to subway station.But it is not safe at all after dark. All front desk employees are smoking at the entrance of the hotel.If you are staying at the kitchen side elevator you have to go through the all stairs to get to the elevator.None of the rooms have the hair dryer and the thermostat.If you ask for a hair dryer front desk will give it to you if they have it other wise they will give you the room number which guest has the hair dyer and you have to knock their door to get it. Rooms are very small,mattress doesn't have a cover so it is absolutely dirty,bath tub and the chair was very dirty.We didn't have any views beside the other rooms window and the dark hall. If you want have a breakfast there it is extra,it is fine.But when",1,1
"This place is disgusting and not as advertised. The pictures of the bathrooms that you see online are not the bathrooms you will be getting. The bathrooms are extremely smell with mold on the showers. The toilet is rusted and looks as if someone had used it all the time. I was suppise to stay for two nights. However, this places was unbearable. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1,1
"I am backpacking through Europe and in order to save a little money, I decided to stay at hostels. I was completely satisfied with all the hostels I stayed at until I got to this one (LE REGENT MONTMARTRE HOSTEL & BUDGET HOTEL). The bathrooms are filthy (mold on the walls and sealing and the sewer smells), the beds are very uncomfortable and dirty, there are people smoking weed and drinking alcohol inside the room and no one checks, there are not lockers, and on top of that anyone can go in and out of the hostel without questions. If you ever go to Paris, this is NOT the place to stay.",1,1
stayed here for 2 nights with 5 friends was put in a room with a filthy bathroom with mould and the paper peeling off every where. dirty bath and toilet and when i complained to front desk I was told to write a review as they always like feedback. Was supposed to have breakfast included and was made to pay for it again......Had to phone my booking agent and be on phone for 27mins with no good outcome from the hostel. beware a 6 bed room on first floor.....,2,1
Do not let the misleading photos or reviews fool you. You can stay at the Ibis across the road for the same price and it's much cleaner and the breakfast is far better. The girl who served breakfast looked miserable and we had a choice between a bit of bread or a croissant for 6 euros per day. The carpets were disgusting and the lift was broken. The only good things were the friendly receptionists and the location. You can get better value for money elsewhere.,1,1
"The receptionist insist to have all payment before we check in and when we found out that we are going to check out early and our stay will be four days not five as the reservation, they refused to refund the payment of the night which was 100 euro.",2,1
"When I'm writing this I still stay in Paris, in Le Regent Hostel. I stay for 2 night and 6 people in one room. There are 5 girl and 1 boy, in the morning the boy was went out. Last night I repacked my luggage and make sure everything was locked, Ilocked my luggage also my bag. And all my money is on my bagg and wallet inside my luggage that I already lock. This morning when I opened my luggage my luggage lock was broken and all my money was gone. I complain to the receptiom and they can't do anything and we can't see the cctv or get any information.",2,1
"At first finding this hostel felt like a great sucsess, but after few days I realized how out of tuch with reality were people at the front desk. I had my room key blocked 2 days in a row, because they wanted to find someone who wasn't even sleepong in my room. And when I was trying to get the explanation about how can this happen, guy at front desk was extremely rude and told me I was being rude for asking it. Is it really so much to ask to get the explanation about why I can't enter the room I have paid for!?!?!  Have never been so disapointed with hostel servis. Hope this was a one time thing, I am NOT recomending this place to anyone.",1,1
"We arrived at 1pm, check in is not until 4pm which we did know. We were able to store our bags in a room We booked a double room with shared bathroom. The room was a shoe box. We found the double bed small and we aren't big people and the room was only 3.5 m X 3.5 m!  One of the annoying things staying here was that there is one toilet per two floors!!! We had to go down stairs and use the toilet which stunk!  If you have one toilet between 8 rooms of two people that's one loo for 16 people??? There's one shower on each level which is a box size ! Reception played loud music all through the night which would echo up the stairs and be distracting.  Our room was on the street side of the building which is noisy. Being a hot couple of days in Paris we had to open the doors for",2,1
"Tiny rooms, not enough toilets/ showers for amount of people, no handbasin in toilet so you have to walk back to your room to wash your hands!!  The carpet is threadbare in every area. Good friendly English speaking staff, not value for money at all especially as hotels in area are same price.",1,1
"Had to stay here after I missed my train home, and it fitted the needs that I had. It was cheap and close to the station. Unfortunately the room that I got had some bad guests as the entire room smelled of all kinds of drugs. After mentioning this to the lobby, they opened a window and that was that. Not really the reaction that I hoped for.  Other than that the facilities were good, there was wifi and a hot shower. But I probably won't come back again.",1,1
"Rudest receptionist I have ever encountered. We had an Issue with Passport Identification. (So suggestion: If you need to stay here all people on booking need to bring their passport). This woman was in no way friendly, helpful or welcoming. She was basically asking us to return home. When we returned to the hostel at around 16.00 in the afternoon we were given our key cards, to a hostel room which had not been cleaned from the guests before us. We complained and were told to wait 15 mins and it would be cleaned. 16.40 we returned to the room and nothing had changed. (rubbish on floor and bins, beds messed up, make up wipes in bathroom)",2,1
"All I needed was a taxi to the airport not a lecture on how I should've reserved the shuttle. However, I came in the night before so I didn't think I would be able to.  The rooms are frightening with the dim green light and tiny space. This is the only hostel I have ever stayed in where they did not have a locker for your luggage.  It's in a continent location, but is it worth it?",2,1
I was not a fan of this hostel. It was shabby but not in an atmosphere enhancing way. He blankets are disgusting and the bathrooms need a lot of love. I left feeling icky. The stay felt really impersonal with disrespectful guests and surly staff. The redeeming qualities were the location and water pressure.,2,1
Argued with one of the staffs as they messed up with our reservation and we have to pay more for it. Tried to call them few weeks before checking in and they were not answering my call. No recommended for my family but for solo travelers maybe. One good thing is that this place is near to metro station.,1,1
"When a friend and I arrived an employee told us the hostel had overbooking and we had to sleep in a private room (we had payed for a shared room so this was great news). The room was old and the mattress was the worst one I ever tried, the springs were all out of the mattress and you could feel them in your back, the day we were leaving we had to take the sheets downstairs and of course we saw the state of the mattress, the filthiest thing; breakfast was OK. Anyway the neighborhood is not the best, during the day is really nice but in the night it’s full of disgusting men… If I ever go back to Paris there's no way I'm coming back to this hostel...",1,1
"We arrived at the hostel with high hopes considering the extortionate price tag placed on the room. However, myself and my co-travellers were left fairly displeased with the service we received. With it being our first time travelling across the continent, we were unsure of what to expect but we were hoping for more than this. We had booked a dormitory for 6 and upon opening the door to the room the pungent, stale stench engulfed our nasal passages and it was far from pleasant. The breakfast was below par and the bar ran out of beer in happy hour which was enraging considering we do like to party hard! Furthermore the location of the hostel should be investigated thoroughly before booking as it is a long way from the main Paris attractions.",2,1
"I liked that it has an elevator wich is nice if you have a lot of luggage.  The staff was friendly, the laundry service was cheap.  The room was clean but I couldn't stand the smell in the common areas and I think I won't come back because of this.",2,1
"Myself and three friends came to Paris over the Easter weekend and stayed at this hostel.  We checked in, were asked to pay and then told by a staff member called Alex that there was a problem. He went on to explain two of us were in one room, the other in a room alone. He said 'you should have booked in advance' to which I said I booked in February. Two months in advance. He then said that just because we'd booked a three beds in a 10bed dorm didn't mean that we were guaranteed those beds to be in the same room. I was on the verge of tears explaining id stayed in hostels all over the world and never known this to happen, its false advertising on the hostel websites if so.  I asked if there was anything we could do he shrugged, said 'ill check' then Gave us our keys. I then",1,1
"The hostel itself was alright but the staff were brutal, specially those serving the breakfast in the morning.  They have no patience and are not very nice when they speak to guests, its like you're bothering them when you ask them a question or if you try to get something from the fridge while they're serving breakfast, they'll ask you what you're doing in the most ""get out of my space"" tone.  I really didn't appreciate the way they were speaking to me or the other guests in the room.  The front desk staff were better but still not the friendliest. I stayed in a 4 bed dorm and the room was so small, there really wasn't enough room for everyones bags so I ended up bringing mine into my bed.  The fact that there was free wifi and breakfast was nice and it was also really close to",2,1
"Good things;  -Close to Sacré Coeur. You can go at night with walking to watch city.  -Breakfast is enough. With a cup of coffee and Croissant, you can have a good breakfast. -There are lockers in the room.  Bad Thing; -Rooms are very small. -Bathroom is not good.  -Wifi is really bad. -Not easy to find from gare du nord.i had map but  i lost my way and asked some people to find hostel. From anvers metro station so close.",2,1
"This is possibly the worst hostel/budget hotel I ever stayed in. The hotel should not allow children to stay here as there is music blaring out until all hours and when your 4 year old child wakes at 3am, dragging them down 2 flights of stairs through a noisy reception to ONLY toilet (situated in the laundry room) for the whole premises is just not acceptable.  My 4 year old child also pulled a pair of dirty boxer shorts from under the bed and got no apology when handed them to a staff member!!",1,1
"Good location, near the metro station. 3 Bed Mixed Dorm (Ensuite) was small and dark. Not too much space in the shower room, the price we paid is expensive for this kind of room. The breakfast service was not good; the staff was late for the breakfast and bad attitude to the client. The arrangement of tables in the kitchen is not really good, no place to walk. Very weak signal for Wifi, we can’t really use it. The hair dryer was broken in the bathroom.",2,1
"This hostel charged extra fee when I pay for the room rate. Staff are very absent-minded and impatient to guests. Facilities are not good enough. It was too noisy because on the roadside. Location of hostel is far from city centre and inconvenient. Price is too high as a hostel. However, breakfast is good.",2,1
"My stay in the hostel took 4 days and was the worst we experienced in all cities I visited in Europe. First, it was the most expensive and the worst in cleanliness. We were in a private double bedroom room, with a shared bathroom and it was used by the whole floor. In addition, the shower was dirty and full of mold.  Also, the toillets were down stairs and only one for 2 whole floors. Staff was ok but not the most nice one.   I don't recommend it because we had an awful time.",1,1
"This hostel is poor to very poor in quality vs price. The rooms are small & cramped, looks something like a pre-70s soviets block county. Small sink and one light bulb, one 220v outlet, two rough sleeping jail house bunk beds. The carpet in the hallway was stained, dirty, worn out and stink of funk. The showers were moldy, dirty and very small. Large people will NOT fit in the shower (shower size is a large refrigerator) and the best part is 20+ people will have to share it. The receptionists were all very friendly and helpful on everything about Paris. Breakfast are OK for being free. WIFI only works in the downstairs common, you'll be lucky to post anything on Facebook during peak hours. BOTTOMLINE:  Tolerable for one night stay passing through Paris, an 2/3 night stay, you're",2,1
"...between rooms was my anthem at Le Regent. I had advised the hostel of my late arrival beforehand. Upon arriving well after midnight, I was told that my reservation could not be found even though I had booked directly through them. There was only one receptionist on duty and it got surprisingly busy. After serving other guests, it was about an hour later before my situation was somewhat sorted: the clerk was only able to give me a room for that night and said he would not charge me for that night as an apology for the mix-up. I was told they had no room for me for the next 3 nights but they would try to find me accommodation somewhere else. As it turned out next day, they were able to accommodate me so I didn't have to stay at a separate hotel from my group. However, I had to",2,1
"I have stayed at many hostels, and this is by far the worst one I have ever been to. It is absolutely filthy, the showers are full of mold, there was urine on the floor in the restroom, bathrooms are only on every other floor. I felt disgusting and dirty taking a shower. The breakfast, that they advertise as being a ""buffet"", is not one at all. They only allow you to take one croissant or one roll, and half of the time they were out of both. It is the loudest hostel I have ever been to, and the staff does not care to keep it quiet for the guests. People were literally screaming at the top of their lungs well past 2AM. The rooms are dark, crowded, and filthy. The blankets feel dirty, and I could not use it. I did not sleep at this hostel because of the noise, and I found the",1,1
"Right from the start, the staff was unfriendly and were not very accommodating. The first room we were in was a 5-person dorm, and the bathrooms were gross, and the blankets were gross. The staff only gives you one code for Wifi, so if you have a computer as well as a phone, you can only use your wifi on one device at a time. This was frustrating because every time you wanted to switch devices, you had to log out on one device, and login on the other. After a couple friends left, we were in a 3 person room, which was MUCH better. Overall, I wouldn't recommend staying there.",2,1
Most disgusting place I have ever stayed in.  6 people sharing one toilet that did not work.  Roommates coming in drunk all hours of the night.  Wifi does not work in rooms and was never given sheets.  Carpets are filthy and black mold in the bathrooms.  God help me that I may never have the misfortune of ever having to stay in such a hellhole again.  I need a shower just having written the mere thought about this place.,1,1
"Well, before going to Paris i chose that location due to proximity to most of sightseeing places of Paris. The price was also attractive - 24 EUR per night for 6-bed room. The staff is really indifferent to the client, sometimes on the reception there was no one because the receptionist was...smoking outdoors. In the bathroom was no soap, so i had to wash hands with the shampoo forgotten by someone of previous guests.  Now the issues regarding the room and sleep quality. The bed was ok (although with 1.80cm height you cannot sit on the lower normally) , but I could not sleep normally for 1-1.5 hours, the Brazilian girl from the bed below was carrying her friends from other rooms to gossip or so. Finally they got tired of chatting and I fell asleep, but my happiness did not last",1,1
"My girlfriend and I were sent here - somewhat apologetically - after being turned away from two other nearby hostels that were full. It quickly became obvious that this place is nothing but an over-priced over-spill for Paris' better hostels in the busy months. Staff were unfriendly, my bed (as did all others in the 6-bed dorm) rested on an unfathomably squeaky frame, the mattress left me feeling itchy the following day, and the awkwardly layed-out common areas failed to foster any kind of atmosphere. Breakfast is laughably minimal; one croissant OR small bread roll each, with a hot drink and juice. We left as quickly as possibly in search of somewhere else.",2,1
"Great location and nice peole work at hotel.thats the posetiv.  Was with two kids and not a kids hotel maybe good for backpacers, It was expensetiv roms we could get better rom at hotel in same locatio cheaper. No tv,two chair in a 3 peple rom. So must sit in beds Must rent towles in reception and take bed sheeds on and off by my self. Breakfast often empty because all backpacers was take all food.",2,1
This is probably one of the worst accommodations I have had in all of Paris - when we came into to our room the bed was dirty and had food crumbs all over it even though check in time was ridiculously late (4 pm) so they had apparently 5 hours to clean the rooms. The shower smelt like urine and there was no signs it had ever been cleaned. The worst part about the hostel for me is that it had 0 sound insulation. We. Could hear everything our neighbours in all sides did and we were facing onto the street so I didn't sleep all night because of how loud it was. Don't reccomended this place if you like cleanliness and a good sleep,2,1
"The officious manner of the receptionist was far from the warm welcome we have received at other hostels.  I was told in no uncertain terms that children were not allowed to ""run around"".  How rude!  My children were far, far better behaved than the majority of adults staying at the hostel.  A 4 o'clock check-in is the latest I have ever known - and the room wasn't ready!  The room was more like a prison cell.  We had a bath - but no plug and despite assurances we would receive one, this didn't materialise.  A member of staff shouted that I shouldn't use an emergency exit.  When I told her I wasn't using it, she asked me aggressively why it was open (a delivery was being made to the kitchen).  The kitchen is not fit for purpose.  Decor is terrible.  Battleship grey and deep",2,1
"I have travelled the world and can honestly say this is the worst hostel I have ever stayed in.  We arrived at 2 pm on Sunday to check in.  When we went up to the room nothing had been cleaned from the people who had been in thereb before.  There was food on the ground, beer bottles with alcohol spilt all over the ground and an opened up condom! The bathroom was disgusting with toilet paper everywhere as well as hair.  When we approached the staff to tell them they said that the cleaner does not come in on Sunday and that we would have to deal with it ourselves.  When we advised them that he should have to clean up the mess he claimed that there was no way of knowing that we had caused the mess.  The place is also very noisy and does have a distinct unpleasant smell about it.",1,1
"The entire place smells awful. I'd suggest an air freshener for every floor, room, and bathroom. It is too much money for what you get. Also, only having a toilet on 2 floors is ridiculous for today's time. If people are paying this much money for the hostel, the least you can expect is to have a toilet on the floor. Also, hair needs to be regularly cleaned from the shower, it flooded the shower room several times during my visit. And lastly, we had crusted ""something"" on our sheets upon arrival. This is not only gross but unhealthy and the final straw in our opinion of the hostel.",2,1
"I arrived at the Regent late in the evening due to getting delayed on a flight arriving in Paris. Was only staying for one night while I was passing through the city. Location is good, just a short walk from the Sacre Coeur. The area is a bit dodgy but the hostel is not far from the metro station. There was a lot of noise, not from the hostel itself but from people walking past outside. Kept me awake for a while. Beds aren't that comfortable. The experience would have been okay, however in the morning I noticed that there was a blood stain on the sheets that were provided to me. Yuck!! (These didn't come from me!!) Couldn't see this the night before as it was dark because the other people in the room were sleeping so I left the light off. To be fair, this is probably an isolated",2,1
"The staff is arrogant. The hostel is very very very noisy. The music volume at the reception and the common room is high 24h a day. It's possible to hear it in the bedrooms. Moreover, the doors slammed constantly. The bedroom was totaly ridiculous. The small metal beds were broken. The ladder to reach my bed was inacessible. There were missing bolts on the bed ladder of my roommate. During the stay, the curtains fell on the ground. So there was light on the night in addition with noise. I went three times to the reception to ask someone to screw the curtains and nobody came. The bath in the bathroom is high and narrow, which is dangerous. Moreover, the bathroom was dirty! The laundry room was dirty too. Finally, I slept in about 30 hostels in my life, and this one is the worst",1,1
I only liked 'sacre couer' view of my room. Thats all i liked about here.the rest is here.....when we first entered the hostel there was urine smell at reception...when we were getting ready to sleep we saw there were dry blood stains on my sheet and dirt on my friend's sheet.and also im pretty sure that those green bed covers  werent changed for new arrivals (us) 'cause black short hair and dirty marks on them were easy to recognize which made us to throw them in the farest spot of the room.we prefered to sleep witout used dirty bed covers but  got really cold at night because the heater didnt work and thin polar blankets under the green bed covers werent enough to get warm... Second day of our stay when we came back to hotel at night we saw that towels from the first day,1,1
"We stayed in Le Regent Hostel July 2012, it is located in the bad section of Paris aka Montmartre, where it is not advisable to leave your hostel after night. Let me give you an idea of the location, my brother walked ten feet from it down the street to the ATM and two gypsy children tried to cover the screen with a piece of paper and pressed more money than he was getting out so they could rob him of it. This was during the day. Also during the day as a woman I could look forward to all the unsavory male characters leering at me in the area. The hostel itself: we walked in and the room still was full of trash from the previous owners, we know because we were the first to check in that day. And their dirty towels were still in the bathroom. And the guy who works at reception is",2,1
"Yes, Paris is expensive when compering to capitals of neighbour countries, still quality of this hostel was dissapointment. We had double room with shared bathroom and shower. First of all, the bathroom was shared between 12 rooms and there were only toilet bowl, no sink. We had to wash our hands at our own room upstairs, which isn't too hygienic. The shower was smelly and there were mold at the roof and walls. There were no possibility to hang towel or clothes anywhere. Our actual room was ok, tiny and walls paperthin. We could hear everything what other quests talked at the hall. That was quite inconvenient, and we couldn't sleep at all at first night when people were partying louldly. I was suprised, that stuff didn't do anything to stop the noise. Other nights were more",2,1
"I would not stay here again. The only saving grace was the ultra-convenient location (so close to the train station and metro!)   This is just a warning...  First of all the hostel/hotel attracts very diverse kinds of people maybe due to the low cost. On our first morning, there was a man talking to himself on the first floor... It put us off a little. The bathrooms in this place are dirty and not well-maintained, though we made do. The rooms as well are not kept well and gave us the feel that they were not cleaned in a long long time. (Maybe the grumpy housemaids just made the bed again for the next stayer!)   Breakfast was alright, the usual hostel fare.  THE THING THAT RUINED IT FOR US: Everyone in the hostel had their backpacks and luggage locks picked by a burglar who stole",2,1
"Do not be misled by the pictures found in 'Gallery' at the official website. The current condition of the hostel is much worse.  Never stay in room 12, the filthiest room I’ve ever come across. The noisiest room in the hostel as it is next to the lift, just above the kitchen, facing the road and located on the 1st floor. Strong smells of urine and feces in and from the toilet. Nightmare.   Ask to view the room 1st before making payment. Ask for receipt after making payment or else it will not be given. Full payment is required upon checking in.  Wifi is available on the ground floor only.  Indifferent staffs. A few are arrogant.  Seedy neighborhood.  There were shouts from the streets every night at 2 or 3 am during our stay.  No towel, soap or shampoo. Towel is on loan at",1,1
"I stayed in Le Regent for 2 days. It was quite clean and the breakfast was ok. Location is good. But the double bed was hardly double, it was very small! The rooms have their windows looking to a common yard and the second night people started to talk from one window to another making impossible to sleep until 2 am. The room was extremely warm and they didn't have any fan or aircon. Even the cheapest hostels have fans! The staff was not friendly at all, in fact they seemed to laugh of our questions. There was only one computer available for all the hostel that is very big, and you have to pay 1 euro for 5 minutes. Not recommedable at all.",2,1
The hostel was in a good location but the carpet was stained and/or dirty and the walls were paper thin. Every time someone walked up the steps or closed their door it was ten times louder than it should have been. I think I got two hours sleep the second night we were there.,2,1
"I will begin from the second we stepped out of Gare Du Nord . It was about 6 in the evening, and we immediately felt intimidated. Gangs were huddled all around the station entrance and would stare at us. We then progressed to find our Hotel (le regent montmartre) , which was in a very good location (close to the Sacre Coeur and the Metro). We went into the reception which was draped in Halloween fake cobwebs and spiders. It looked alright but nothing special. The receptionist was very unclear about where the lift was. We had to ask several times. We arrived on about the third floor. As we opened the door, it hit the bed. I was absolutely disgusted with what I saw. The walls were stained, the floor was stained with what I could only assume was urine, and it smelt stale. The",1,1
"Luckily, we only spent one night in this place. It is accessible by metro. But, the neighborhoods are shabby and not safe especially at night. If you are travelling alone, it is not a wise idea to stay in this hotel/hostel (well, unless you want to have a littler ""adventure"").  In addition, the service is horrible. Messy service system and unorganized staff. Not responding and unfriendly. I really dont wanna see those cold faces again. We asked for the hotel bill when checking out. The receptionist told us that the printer didn't work and promised us that he will send the bill to us by email. And guess what - after one week, the bill has not yet been sent. I called them and emailed them several times and they always told me that the bill has been sent or some other lies. They",1,1
"I'm not uptight and crazy  but this info could really benefit you for booking. It very much depends on what it is that you are looking for. From the start...as soon as we got off of the Metro, passers by were warning us to hold tight to our bags for fear of thieves in this ""risky area"". Once we arrived to the Hotel, the door stays locked, another hint suggesting the area is dangerous. Once inside the lobby, hip hop was blasting, everyone was 18-23 years of age and there was one reception attendant who was completely overwhelmed. It was 4 o'clock and left overs from breakfast remained stale on the counter. We were told that we were to change rooms the following day to a different room because the first room that we selected was not available. That's when she told us that we were",2,1
"we stayed in one of the rooms with shared bath and toilet. the rooms was terrible, the carpet was dirty and worn, the paint job on the walls was cracked. the bed was a large single not a double so we only got a few hours of sleep a night. the tv is only french channels, the road outside the window is noisy 24/7 and shower is smaller and dirtier than the showers in Bulgaria! typical french attitude in the lobby and breakfast area. oh and breakfast was ok, but that's about all that was good",1,1
"The website for this hostel is very VERY deceiving. The pictures make the place out to be a beautiful spot, calling it the ""Hotel Le Régent Montmartre"" when really it is only a hostel and a dirty one at that. The staff was terribly unorganized with line ups out the door at all times. When we were finally able to check in, after waiting over an hour, we got upstairs to find there weren't any sheets on the bed! The room was filthy, smelled of mold, and had numerous holes in the walls. The only thing the website was truthful about was the view of Sacré Coeur, which was superb.  I often stay in hostels and when you book one you take what you get, but the website for this place has made it out to be a hotel and I was VERY VERY disappointed. If you're on a tight budget, planning last",1,1
"Recently stayed at the Regent Hostel in Paris...not worth it.  I believe there's a hotel portion and a hostel portion.  Not sure if the hotel side is any better but the hostel portion was not worth the money.  The directions on the website/reservation actually led us to their 'sister hostel' which looked much nicer.  The beds are not labelled so it is difficult to tell which beds are being used/which are not.  The 3 nights we were there, none of the sheets in any of the beds were changed so someone new who came in the last night had to sleep in dirty bedding.  Where our room was located (2nd floor) it was ridiculously noisy.  I understand in a hostel there's going to be noise, but this was so bad you couldn't sleep at all and there's not even an on-site bar.  I would not return.",2,1
"Turn left out of the tiny, cramped lobby and you're just a few minutes walk from Moulin Rouge and all of the sex shops you could want. Not quite the perfect vacation with a teenagers. Beautiful view of Sacred Couer from the balcony in the cramped, rundown room with the bathroom that leaked when our neighbors ran water. No towels, no sheets without paying extra. No laundry facility. Poor breakfast of cereal or croissants and coffee (no tea). No fruit. No cheese. No convenient refrigerator for my leftovers. While the French have a reputation for being rude, the staff surpassed that, offending each member of our party with newer lower standards of service. The boulevard outside the hostel stinks of urine, which given the number of sex shops in the area is not a surprise. The hostel",2,1
"When we arrived at the hotel, there was a problem with our booking and we were given a room with a shared bathroom, instead of a private bathroom - we asked if we were able to upgrade, as we werent happy about the shared bathroom (the toilet wasnt even close to the room) but the receptionist was very unhelpful and told us we werent able to that night, and try again in the morning. The room was disgusting, dirty floor, the table only had three legs, held up by the wall and the bed was not big enough for two people and there was no room to move around the bed to the other side of the room. Everytime someone flushed the toilet we could hear the water pouring down the wall besides our bed, and along with the loudness of people in the hotel/hostel, didnt constitute a good nights",1,1
"After reading a few reviews I decided to book this hotel since we were on a tight budget and it was cheaper than other hotels I stayed in before in paris. So i email the receptionist and ask politely for a room with a view and he emailed back confirming my request. I was actually excited but when I got there I was wondering if i was at the right hotel. It was more like a hostel not a hotel. The room they gave us was appalling and of course there was no view to the Sacre coeur. I checked the bathroom and it was clean so I didnt complain. Not that i could do anything cause it was too late, once we got there we were asked to pay immediately before we could see the room on the sixth floor with the amazing view they told us about! Thank god i had slippers with me because the stains",2,1
"I was very disappointed by this hotel.  The place we arrived at was definitely not the place described in the photos on the hotel's website.  Perhaps some rooms are nicer than others, but ours was pretty shabby.  The carpet was threadbare and the bathroom was so small I had to sit sideways on the toilet!  Between the street noise and the sounds from guests in other rooms (we could hear a guy singing in the next room!), it was not the most peaceful place either.  The hotel was also being renovated at the time we were there, so there were no lights in our hallway and the walls were taped off for painting.  On the upside, it was very close to a metro station and the staff was friendly.  However this hotel is definitely not romantic or comfortable.",1,1
"We were meant to stay at le Regent for a week however on arrival I was appalled at the overall state of the rooms.  Carpets were threadbare, and the rooms in no way looked like what is shown on their website.  I understand rooms in Paris are generally small, but this was ridiculous.  We had a cheap freestanding cupboard with 3 coathangers in it which took up pretty much all the spare floorspace.  The shower door didn't shut properly, with a gap of about 3 inches, so the tiny bathroom ended up soaked.  In addition we had difficulty getting the radiator going, so the room was freezing.  I asked reception for a larger/ better room and was told all rooms were the same. My in-laws came into our room and were surprised as their room was larger than ours, proving reception weren't",1,1
"This hotel was a disaster. I could not recommend anyone stay here at all. They did not take our internet booking deposit off the total price so we had to pay the entire amount over - a loss of 10% to me - even when I questioned this the manager said that the deposit was to do with the booking engine and had nothing to do with the hotel. Be warned!  Check in was a disaster - we had booked two rooms and everytime we needed to pay something someone different was on the desk that didn't seem to understand english properly and couldn't work out that we had two rooms on the one booking so we'd have to explain over again. When we checked in they asked for one night up front then said we could pay on departure then on the second day demanded we pay for the rest immediately, which was",1,1
"I stayed one night because I had a layover of 20 hours from Paris to Mexico City so decided to book a hotel in Paris and enjoy my time but it turned out to be a bad experience. I paid 116USD just for my room for a single stay. It's a rip off money......There is nothing in the room just TV and phone, the pics on expedia has no clue with the reality. I was shocked when I saw the hotel. The hotel in general, corridors and room have a dark, dirty look and room was smelling terrible insect spray. The bed sheet and towels were clean, if you don't mind where you sleep, you can stay but if you want to go back to a nice, clean place to sleep after a long day, this is not the right place for you. Good for backpackers. So rude and unfriendly staff for the day shift; there were 2 nice guys",1,1
"My wife and I took a short trip to Paris in April to celebrate her birthday. We are both VERY versatile travellers and have traveled the world staying in places as nice as the Ritz and as basic as a Research Station on the Talamanca Indian Rez in the mountains of Costa Rica. All this to say, we are not always the ""pamper me"" cliental.  That being said, I booked the Hotel Le Regent Montmartre with a very open mind, knowing it could be a hit or miss. I had read mixed reviews but tend to not trust all reviews as it seems for some reason some hotel guests think they will get the Ritz for next to nothing.  Prior to our arrival, the hotel was very helpful in making sure we fully understood how to get there from the airport and responded promptly to my emails. Upon arrival we were",2,1
"We've stayed at Le Regent Montmartre for 3 nights. Rooms were decently sized, but  very poorely equipped: no closets, no fridge, no A/C. Carpet was old and did not look very clean, so was the tub. The shower was good. Nice location, very close to Anvers Square. One of our rooms had a beutiful view to Sacre Coeur. EUR 105 per night is too much for this hotel - it's worth EUR 70 maximum.",2,1
"+ nice location (near Anvers Metro station and Sacre Coeur) + good staff + quiet room, sufficient air ventilation, walls recently painted + decent breakfast  - room needs renovation: uggly kick holes on both sides of the bathroom door, uneven and dirty floor - room has no cabins or shells for clothes, had to keep everything in our bags for the whole stay (several nights) - ridiculously small 14"" TV (attached to the ceiling), had to rise from the bed and walk half way closer to read any text from the screen - minor issues in the bathroom: loose tiles and old screw holes  - breakfast room too tightly packed  Overall it would have been good value for the price (under 120 € / night for a three bed room including breakfast for 2 adults with a 8 years old child) if the room had been",2,1
"This hotel was a nightmare.  From the pictures and the hotel's website, we thought the place would be a nice, no frills place to stay in Paris.  It wasn't. Our first room was so depressing that we asked to see another.  We ended up taking the second room, but the bed was so bad we left after only 3 days (we booked for 7).   The bed didn't have pillow cases.  Instead, they used an oversized sheet which they folded back over two nasty little pillows.  The bathroom was freezing-so cold you could barely use it.   There were a zillion other issues too, but this should give you the flavor of the place.",1,1
"The worst hotel ever, I felt like if I was entering an horror movie with the eerie dark corridors and an old and destroyed room. I and my wife were not looking for luxury or anything fancy, just a place clean and well maintained which usually tells a lot about the hotel itself. Drapers were ripped and falling from the window, window was broken and not closing at all, the bed was like a ""pizza"" higher on the corners and very shallow in the middle so was really pleasant to wake up (assuming the we’ve got some sleep at all) next morning and get off that torture. I really tried to find another place after 15 minutes in the room but was late at night and everything around was just completely sold-out. Do not go by the pictures you see in the internet, they were probably from one room",1,1
"Convenient if coming from Gare du Nord, but I found the room extremely noisy (window opened on Rue de Dunkerque). It was difficult to sleep sometimes, even with ear plugs and had to keep the window shut.  Hotel could do with a lot of TLC, lobby, staircase,landings and breakfast area a bit shabby. Room clean and private bathroom OK. Could do with DECENT coffee at breakfast, what I was served does not really deserve thIS name - really disgusting and lukewarm on most days. Bread rolls could also have been fresher and crustier, otherwise good selection of items. Staff very friendly and helpful. OK for a few days, but will not book this on my next trip to Paris.",2,1
"Stayed to the Regent Montmartre after xmas for three days , the room given ( room 32 ) was tiny , the bathroom was small , shower head detached  , toilet seat coming off , toilet chiped and disgusting. On a main road so noisy at night . Situated between Pigalle ( red light district) and Barbes  felt a bit unsafe to walk around at night . One good thing hotel is walking distance from Le sacre coeur. After the first night we asked to change room, we were given room 202 slighty bigger and nice bathroom appart from shower door not shutting properly, but once again on a side road so was noisy at night still. Rooms were nothing like the pictures and rooms advertised on their website , for £50 a night could do better",1,1
"Although this hotel had received some mixed reviews on Tripadvisor, my daughter, husband and I saw a picture of one of the family rooms and thought it looked clean and charming...so I booked it.  This was a mistake.    It had been described as a upgraded hostel, and certainly the price was great.  The people at the front desk were very nice, but our room was absolutely terrible.  The smallness of the room we could have dealt with; the fact that it had 3 single beds, instead of a double and a single, as I had requested in my email -- again, no big deal.  However, the room was shabby, moldy, worn and run down.  The bathroom walls were peeling (likely lead paint!), there was black mold everywhere, and the toilet was dripping sewage water everytime you flushed.  If that wasn't",1,1
"I came to this hotel as a student traveling in Europe.  I am a female and I was not traveling alone.  Two friends of mine were staying in a hotel close to this one.  I chose this hotel for one reason: it was close to the hotel my friends were in.  I couldn't get a room at their place, because it was booked.   This place wasn't bad upon arrival.  The people weren't the friendliest, but i can deal with that.  The room was OK.  Extremely small, but hey, you get what you pay for.  It was clean as well.  I didn't feel it was unsanitary.  The bathroom was in the hallway though.  I didn't love that.   All in all the place was fine.  It wasn't until my first night there that I became distressed.  I returned with my two friends back to the hotel.  The man working behind the desk followed",1,1
"Le Regent offered me a clean room of my own, with new sheets and towels daily. My experience with the breakfasts was quite good--though they charge an arm and a leg (6 Euros). This was worlds better than your average youth hostel, but that's where the good time ends. As of Feb. 2005, Le Regent is still under renovations. I had to endure the smell of paint and walk over splattered cardboard and drop-cloths to get to the one freezing bathroom nearest my room. The shower, though thankfully warm, was a mere dribble of water from a broken showerhead and I got cleaner using the sink in my room (which was good). Worst of all--do NOT use the phones in your room to call abroad. Le Regent is part of a tourist scam, though if they know it or not, I don't know. International calls made from",2,1
"There must be hundreds of hotel of a similar price in Paris that are better than this ghastly establishment.  They do indeed have views of the Sacre Coeur, as they advertise on their website, but only those facing the main road on the top two floors - about 15% of the total rooms so they must have a lot of disappointed customers. We asked on our reservation for a room with a view and were told that it should not be a problem but it was. But we were put in a room on the first floor on the main road where it was busy, it smelled of paint and the only space to hang a coat was a rack with three old and bent hangers. The only positive thing was the bathroom which had been recently refurbished.  The breakfast was chaotic. Two stressed out waitresses with too much work and not enough",1,1
"My sister & I stayed there for one night in August 2002.  Thank goodness it was only one night!  We had booked a twin-bedded room (via the Busabout accommodation booking website) but our room had a tiny double bed.  We showed them our booking print-out, stating twin beds, but were told ""that's all we have"".  Of course they'd made us pay before we'd seen the room!  The hotel only had one shower, which was disgustingly mouldy and was broken anyway!  Luckily there was a wash-basin in our room.  The hotel only had one toilet!  The carpets were stained (probably from when the shower still worked), the wallpaper was peeling and there were holes in the walls in our room.  We didn't feel secure in our room as the door and lock seemed flimsy.  This was the first night of our month",1,1
"Booked this for my parents and myself, it does not look anything like in the pictures or even close, the room is tiny, this was suppose to be for 3 adults not 2 adults and 1 child, the bed is tiny not even enough for a child and absolutely ridiculously uncomfortable, stained all over the sheets, floor was sticky and the service is even worst or should I say no service at all, Paid over €200 for this?

"Tiny hotel close to Madeline. Good point are that is clean and people worling are helpful. But if you think that you are going to overnight in a 4star hotel....well this can't be more far from reality. The standard of this hotel is for maximum 2 stars: room are tiny, dark, old and cheap closet and incredibile, no possibility of climate control. Is very cold amd to heat the room they bring me an electric oil heater. Very polite, but this is not the standard expected with this price and this star positioning.  Overated.",2,1
"So we arrive to this hotel, the entrance seems nice, but the service was poor.  Location: Is not bad, but no that good neither, is close to the metro station and that's it  Reception and service: Weak, basic, we ask for ice, sorry sir we dont have it, we ask for shaving cream, sorry sir we dont have it, and is a 4 stars hotel ...  Rooms: Ok rooms, and that's it  Will I come back? Definetely not, this is suppose to be a 4 stars hotel, but honestly if you remove the Bells and whistles of the webpage or reception decor this is more like a 3 stars hotel at most.",2,1
The hotel is mediocre but has really bad management and staff  If you ever get back to the hotel after 11pm you have to hope that the extremely rude night shift bold receptionist is not sleeping for him to open the door in addition if you talk to him doesn't even reply its people like him that gives the bad service image of paris  I believe he doesn't care about anything and the management is stupid enough to keep him and ruin the hotel's image  I believe that the least you expect from a hotel is smiling employees and not rude and sleepy employees,1,1
"I chose this hotel, but made an error as I had been thinking of another place in the same arrondissment with a similar name. I was given a suite, which sounded good, but was so TERRIBLE that I could not even stay in it for one night. The couch was horribly uncomfortable and there was no TV in the bedroom part. I was told there were no feather pillows, which later turned out to be false.  As well, the balcony looked out on nothing. When I went down to say I was leaving, they came up with a much better suite, which was very nice and modern. However, I needed to stay two nights and the good suite was only available for one. As well, when I requested a toothbrush, they brought me a box with a toothbrush on the outside, but q-tips on the inside. When I called down to tell them, they",2,1
"Trip adviser  Do not accept Room 57. We are accustomed to relatively small rooms in Paris hotels but have never come across such a tiny and inadequately equipped bedroom as no 57 at the Mathurin. The double bed occupied almost all the floor space, so if I wanted to get to the other side of the bed my wife had to clamber onto the bed. There was only one chair which constantly had to be moved so that either of us could move about - to go to the bathroom, for example. There was a small hanging closet but no drawers anywhere for clothes that cannot be put on a hanger. We ended up leaving them in our suitcase. There was a nice balcony - if one could clamber over the bed to get to it - but no chair or table on the balcony. This was at best a single room which the hotel had no business",1,1
"I stayed here a year ago and thought it was lovely. But going back was a shock. The redecoration is tacky but unimportant.

The room is stiflingly hot even though the heating is switched off and its freezing outside. The staff are neither friendly nor warm and only occasionally helpful (In a 4 star hotel I expect to be offered some help with my bags).

No consideration of a discount for their error in pricing, no direct contact from hotel nor an apology. My booking was cancelled. I am now looking at how to fund a much more expensive surprise trip!

Nice hotel but the room was too tiny with a horrible view on the inside Room service was bad as we ordered a sandwich and it arrived very cold one hour later and it costed 20 euros  Bathroom also very small and no proper shower  Definitely no a four star hotel,2,1
"I have to say when I first arrived to the hotel I thought it was a good deal. However, I have never ever in my entire life seen a rude staff like this hotel. I really felt unwelcome to a level I had to check out and find another hotel. There is one lady there who does not smile at all no matter how nice you are to her and she always speak to you in a rude manner. She was a rude to a level that when I called for an Internet pass over the phone she tried to give me the password two times and when she failed to deliver the code she hangup on my face!!!!! I left this hotel with a very bad feeling that made me believe that the hotel does not welcome cretin type foreigners. I even expressed my feeling frankly to the hotel manager and she was as cold as her staff. Disappointing!!!!",1,1
"Ridiculously small rooms - the worst I have seen in Paris, and that is saying something. I travel with a relatively large suitcase and when I put it in the room, I had to climb over the corner of the bed to get to the wardrobe/ cupboard.  The recently upgraded decor is trendy kitsch - they are trying to go for a high end boutique vibe and using it to justify premium prices. Definitely not worth it.   Try the Bedford on Rue de l'Arcade around the corner. Much more basic but authentic and infinitely better value",2,1
"I had seen excellent reports and beautiful pictures online for this hotel and was keen to stay.  I phoned them directly as it was for a last-minute reservation.  The receptionist was extremely rude, despite my speaking French.  After compiaining she couldn't hear me (even though she responded to my questions, so she must have been able to), she told me they don't take direct reservations (this is the first hotel I have ever comes across that doesn't!) over the phone and that I needed to book online.  She then put the phone down on me.   I still think the hotel looks amazing but if service is pat of what you expect, then think again!",1,1

The bathroom, although quite large compared to the room, also lacked shelves on which to place personal amenities. The taps of the bath were placed ridiculously high and on the far end of the tub, behind a glass partition door, which made it difficult to turn the water on. The whole tap system was rather complicated and took some time to figure out. There were",2,1

Having paid for a place to stay I would've thought I would have the basic human right to breathe freely and not be harassed simply for entering without a mask.",1,1
"I got my bag stolen at the hostel and told the reception about it when I left, in case they find it back at some point. They called me on the same evening to tell me that they found it. I called them back on the next day, to inform them that a friend of mine would pick it up.When my friend came, they told him that they threw the bag away...Then I called them everyday, always getting the same answer ""sorry but I don't personally know about this issue, please call back tomorrow"", until I finally got an email address to which I had to write (of course, two times...), to get the following answer "" since you didn't respond to our message, we threw the bag away"". I find it extremely dishonest and irespectul.",2,1
"I loved the room: great beds with USB chargers and electric plugs for every bed.  But the woman who checked us in was mean, and she didn't even speak French.  I think she was Spanish.  We decided to leave and go to another hostel.",1,1
"Cute hostel, nice bar, service super-lame. The the elevator was broken when I was there.  I have a bad back & chose this hotel as description stated elevator + good for people with mobility issues, but when the elevator broken, they took no steps to make-up for thi. I  asked for help at reception: woman working there told me to buzz-off - tough-luck about the elevator.  FYI she couldn't speak French, surprising at a bg Paris hostel.  The younger staff (I met in the bar) were nicer (and they speak French). There's a free breakfast which was 'average'.  Rooms interesting: Pod-beds wth plugs. Wifi works. It's in the seedier part of Paris, but I didn't feel unsafe.  If they hired new staff, and fixed their elevator, it'd be a better place.",1,1
"NEVER STAY HERE. A few months ago  I was staying a few days in Paris.  I stayed in the Hostel St. Christopher, and while I was there, my Dad almost died.  I got a facebook message while I was in my bed at night, in a room full of people.  I jumped up and as I needed to call a hospital and my family members, I went to the reception. I told the guy(s) two of them on-duty what happened.   They shrugged at me, and told me all the common areas were closed.  I didn't want to sit in the stairway, so I asked if I they could please sit on the couch and talk on the phone.  I was clearly upset.  The guy working was Spanish and had light brown hair, a white t-shirt and  a pot-belly: He seemed to be very comfortable there, like he was a senior employee or a boss.  He was extremely rude.",1,1
"I checked in at 4.30pm and found my bed sheets & pillows dirty with black spots on them. I told the reception guy 3 times and every time he says someone will change them right now. It took them 1.5hrs to change my bed sheets! Horrible...and reception reply is ""cleaning staff has other things to do!"" .",1,1
"I was staying in this Hostel many times since year 2014 up until recently year 2018......in the Summer 2018, there is NOT fans and NO AC blower provided in the room.....please if you have High Blood Pressure and Cardiologist Heart Problem,,,,,....please AVOID this Hostel....Staff were NOT friendly and rude.....siding with other guest who was very Mouthy and extremely talkative guest...who talked non stop over 1 hour in the room and partying with booze in the room......for teenagers.....this Hostel is a perfect partying room hostel......This Establishment shower room wall are moldy with black mushrooms and NOT being refurbished for a long time......Elevator is often broken....so if you have a strong legs and a strong hand....you can carry your own heavy luggage to the 5th floor",1,1
"1. poor wifi in the room. totally was not able to use. 2. noisy street-side (which is inevitable) 3. they gave a towel that has been displayed on the counter. too dusty, that you can feel and see it when you use it.",2,1
"Do not stay here! Nice enough hostel however it is located in a dodgy area of Paris that is dangerous at night especially for solo female travellers. You are much better off spending your money to stay at St Christopher’s gare du nord (also in Paris), which has 24/7 security and is in a better area of Paris.",2,1
"Out of all the hostels I have stayed in this year, this has to the the worst. Definitely out there to make money, with a lack of hostel atmosphere. Location is pretty far out a 10 minute walk from nearest metro station- but in a safe, residential location.",1,1
"We checked in via the online check in. We arrived with a large group so we're unable to use it to the full potential but given the size the line check in was very fast.   The hostels bar is a public bar also so it was packed when we arrived. There is always music, and games and there is a night club on Friday nights. The food was alright, the drinks seems pretty expansive but they do have some good deals (happy hour etc). They do give you deals if you are staying there so make sure you tell them when you order.   We had a private room with shared bathroom on the 1st floor, I had been reading reviews and saw some about the smell and figured it was going to be a typical hostel smell. Nope, it's far worse. We couldn't pin point exactly where the smell is coming from but it's pretty",2,1
"I had booked a 4 bed female dorm. The room was tiny, no sort of ventilation or fan which was horrible in the extreme heat. The shower was dirty, toilets were smelly, staff were rude and didn't seem interested. Location isn't ideal but close to Gare Du Nord. Shame because I have stayed at many St Christopher's hostels across Europe and the UK and I've had nothing but good experiences at the other ones. Won't be coming back.",1,1
"I spent 5 days at the St Christopher's Canal Hostel in Paris and was thoroughly unimpressed. Firstly, I had read a lot about the 'smell' but shrugged it off seeing as most hostels can get smelly if there's a plumbing emergency but surely enough, at least 3/5 days I stayed there the hostel halls were almost unbearably disgusting. The bar downstairs is okay, the drinks and food at pretty expensive but it's Paris so that's expected. However the bar is open to the public which really takes away front the hostel vibe. The 'Chill-out' room is extremely small for a hostel with 350+ beds and the hostel doesn't have a shared kitchen to prepare your own meals, as a way to force you to spend money at the bar. Overall the hostel feels more like a hotel than a hostel. The staff were lovely",2,1
Bar itself is cool...and room is ok..but no air con.. no fan and no window opening.. are you kidding...its 2017 ...if you are going to take nearly 100 euros off 3 people when its 29 degrees in Paris at least have the decency to whack a few fans in the room ... worst night sleep ever...you might want to look at changing your matresses too into the bargain ....,1,1
"We booked a 4 person dorm for 2 of us and were pretty disappointed, primarily from a number of little things adding up.  Though it was very good of the hostel to provide step by step directions from the metro station, the metro station they said we should go to was clearly a fair bit further away than another metro station.  The booking said there were lockers under our beds but it turns out the 4-person rooms are the only rooms without lockers under the beds and you have to go to the basement to lock our bags.  I'm not sure what the booking said about air conditioning but there was none. The room was horribly hot and humid and it was impossible for myself or my friend to get any sleep. There was one fan which didn't really help.  The staff were friendly but they informed us",2,1
"The hostel is easy to get to and the rooms are clean and large but the hostel is miles away from the main attractions (50 minutes to the Eiffel Tower). Additionally the bathrooms are regularly dirty and the day staff, whilst nice and friendly, were very slow and consistently gave wrong and outdated information about Paris. The bar and restaurant attached are good though! The night staff were very helpful and nice!",2,1
"Great location and good hostel by the canal. On my second night thought my charger wasn't working. Reception told me no electricity in my room and some others on my floor.   Tried to fix and didn't work, no rooms to change to. Stayed up late downstairs to charge my phone enough to ensure I can wake up for my 7.30am train to London. Not happy with service as I paid for a private room and expect more.",2,1
I finally made it to my hostel and was able to check in early! They provided me an “upgrade” so I could check in early. I was upgraded to a 6 bed dorm instead of 12 on the 5th floor. The elevator was broken and my knee was pretty sore from a previous sports injury so it was a bit annoying to have to do so many stairs but I survived! The check in staff was extremely pleasant and wished me a belated birthday. I chucked my stuff on my bed which were assigned and headed down to the canal terrace to have a pint. Beer was cheap and the terrace was overlooking the river. There was a pub downstairs. The bartender was awesome and super friendly. There was an epic beer pong set up and some really good music playing. A super cool place to chill out and meet some people.   One of the,2,1
"Breakfast set up was inconvenient and awkward. No yogurt so I got my own. The lounge area was very small, crowded and uncomfortable. There are signs not to eat in room but at least there was a table and chair that one could sit at.  Room faced the street and was noisy. Try to get a room at facing canal. The lockable storage under the beds were difficult to use. In order to open them, you had to pull them all the way out to raise the lid and if the person on the other side of the room pulled theirs out it was impossible to move about the room. The light next to the bed was so dim, impossible to read by. Asked for a brighter bulb but when a workman showed up he fixed one of the broken curtains, not the others and told me there were no brighter bulbs.  The restaurant and bar is",2,1
"My single room was broken into in the middle of the night while I was sleeping. Someone managed to get into my room through the balcony window. I imagine this happens all the time. Definitely would not recommend. Further, the elevator did not work for 3 days and staff were marginally helpful at best.  Lots of better options in Paris.",1,1
"Firstly, the staff were rude and unhelpful, we booked and were promised a 6 bed room for all 5 of us to be together...but we were separated. They proceeded to tell us there was nothing they could do.   Secondly, we weren't all given key cards so couldn't go to the toilet/shower/downstairs freely. You needed a key card to use the lift and stairs so we got stuck downstairs even though we were told we could use the stairs without the key card. Thirdly, we were sharing a room with one other traveller...he came in very intoxicated and sounded aggressive and unwell. He vomited all over the floor and in his bed. He made no effort to clean/to have it cleaned, so we had to inform reception and a cleaner was sent up to clean it up. The smell was repulsive! We were told we couldn't move",2,1
Me and my mum decided to stay here after reading rave reviews on the net. We both couldn't be more disappointed in every aspect of our stay so much so I don't even no where to start. The toilet and showers were filthy period blood smeared on the wall the I might add it  was left there until we mentioned it to staff as it had not been cleaned for 48 hours. A toilet also got blocked and flooded the whole bathroom with poo a matter that also was not resolved until we went down stairs and told staff and they reluctantly cleaned it. Our room was not cleaned for the first three days and we were not given fresh towels either. The staff bar one friendly girl were quite rude and extremely unhelpful with directions. It is also in a bad area an takes multiple metro stop to get to any of,1,1
"First impression during arrival was good location and easy to find. The reception service was slow and not that informative about the hostel's facility. Elevator is rather dirty with marks of many stains on the elevator's wall. We were given room 508 (dormitory 8 beds) and found the room quite spacious and rather clean with a hint smell of dampness. The common toilet & bathroom for women was far from being impressive. Greeted with flooded floor, among 3 toilets, only 1 was available, dirty of course and among 3 shower cabins, only 1 was available, drain seemed blocked. The bar area is cool but didn't hang around that long. Please note that upon arrival we were not being informed about the basic rules nor the facility. The worst side of our stay was actually the security, which",1,1
Single room you will pay €120 and its tiny with wall rot and disgusting smell. The dorms are much the same - you can't get internet in the room and pretty average sleep wise.  it's possibly the worst hostel I've stayed in.... I would recommend spending a bit more and staying in the other St Christopher's on Paris (but I can't review this I've just heard it's better) or another hostel completely.  There was a disabled man in our hostel room and the lift was out of service. They carried him from the bottom floor to the 3rd floor and left him there.. There was no internet so he couldn't contact his carer.,1,1
"The rooms are good (no air conditioning, it can get pretty hot), but the bathrooms are terrible. There are only two men's showers for an entire floor, only two which is terrible! It is such a long queue in the morning just to take a shower. The bar is terrible as well, they overcharge customers so much, they charged me bloody 7.5 euros for one bloody beer, that's a rip off. Worst bar I have ever been to. They seemed to be  a bit racist as well. The breakfast is pathetic as well. No variety at all. The elevator wasn't working had to climb with my luggage to the fifth floor. The location is not great if you want to visit Paris as a tourist, located quite far from anything important. But the canal is cool for a drink or two. Wouldn't recommend to a friend.",2,1
"St. Christopher's seemed alright when we arrived. We were on the 6th floor and the elevator was broken our entire four night stay so that was unfortunate. We were told we were in beds G & I, but an hour after going to bed the first night a girl came in and told my friend he was in her bed, though he was in G where he was told to be. He moved to an empty bed. There is no air conditioning at St. Christopher's so other people in our hostel insisted the window remain open over night. This is not located in a quiet part of town. So needless to say I got a only a few hours of sleep. The next night we came in and there were people in G and the bed my friend had slept in the previous night. We go to the desk and ask where we're supposed to be sleeping, he says beds G & I. We explain",1,1
"I and my friends stayed in a 8 person bedroom and all was fine untill we checked out. The hostel provided us a room to keep our luggage so  that we wouldn't have to carry it while we went around Paris to utilize half of the day.Later when we came back, 2 of our hand carry were missing. The authorities responsible for it were least bothered and when I said i wanted to watch the CC camera, they said there were no bags as we described. and they also did not allow me into the monitoring room . It was time to leave and our bags were still not found we were told that they would send it back if they found it but they never replied to any of my text. How irresponsible!!",1,1
"St Christophers canal is not in the Centre of Paris, but is about 3 metro stops from Nord station. I stayed 2 nights and was impressed by the large rooms and privacy curtains. However there were many negatives. The wifi only worked in the lobby, hallway and rather randomly the bathroom. the staff were rude and often took ages to even serve you when you were the only one waiting. And the breakfast is a joke - dry french stick cut into small pieces and nutella. Considering it is one of the more expensive hostels i wouldn't stay here again.",2,1
"A lot of bad things, Firstly, is too far from all activities in paris, you have a 7 min to reach the subway and min 30 min to reach the downtown. Secondly, The rooms it's not so clean and the service room do not spend everyday. Thirdly, The WiFi does not pick in the room. Except the free breakfast before 10 am and the friendly staff, it was not my best stay. Likewise it was not my first time in Paris, and it doesn't will be the last. But definitely not in this hostel.",2,1
"There are three main issues:  1: location, you spend have of your time in Paris getting to the hostel, it's very far from everything.   2: Some of the staff working there are more concerned over being fun and not efficient and service oriented. some are very rude, others are awesome.  3: I stayed in the 6 th floor, however the elevator was damaged. I spend 4 days in the hostel and never saw a single guy fixing it. However what concerns me is that this is a constant problem, and many reviews can confirm it, but they awnser that the issue has been solved. It's not a cheap hostel, invest in your infrastructure !",2,1
"Pros -Comfortable bed -Nice complimentary breakfast  Cons -NO FREE LUGGAGE STORAGE. There are only so many lockers so if they're all taken, you're left on your own. I saw several guests wasting precious time left wondering what to do with their things. -one of the ladies rooms was missing toilet paper, hand soap, and toilet seat in all stalls. -one staff member continually skipped over me and began assisting other people (unprompted by the guests) even when she was in the middle of assisting me...even walked away at one point, leaving me standing waiting for her to return. Very passive aggressive staff member. The guy who seemed like a supervisor of some sort did his best to assist everyone and multitask.",2,1
"Rooms get warmer than 30°C and so clammy it's impossible to sleep in. We were 10 people in the room, everyone having problems with it and most of the other people I talked to.   After two gruesome nights I just couldn't go to sleep on my third. Asked if there was anything reception could do.  NO!  No help finding other hotels, no refund, no relocation, no empathy, no understanding, no sense of guilt.   For a modern and slightly expensive hostel, I'd expect a lot more. Being able to sleep would be a start.",1,1
"I recently stayed at St. Christopher's Inn and my experience of Paris was ruined by the location of this hostel. It isn't located in a very nice part of town and you have to take about a 30 minute metro to get to the central part of Paris. I didn't feel safe even walking to the metro. The hostel itself is very clean and the staff is fairly friendly, but it is an American hostel so you don't get much of a local atmosphere. I would not recommend staying here simple because it is so far away from everything.",2,1
"We recently stayed at st christophers canal in paris and were very disapointed. We were in a double private room. In the hallway outside our room there was water leaking from the roof and running down the walls. It was so excessive that there were puddles of water in several spots along the hallway. Furthermore, the main female bathroom on our floor had huge puddles of water on the floor for the entirety of our stay (4 nights), no one bothered to fix the toilet that was causing the leak. The water caused the toilet to have a horrible smell to it. The boys toilet on our floor was ""out of order"" the entire time we stayed there. We were on the 5th floor and the elevator wasn't working, again for the entirety of our stay, so we had to climb the stairs with all our luggage, each",1,1
It must be said that this is a massive hostel and that is not what I was looking for. If you do want to stay in a big hostel with a big party atmosphere then you will prob enjoy it. It was noisy all through the night and I barely slept. It is in a rough neighbourhood so the walk from the metro is unpleasant. the bathrooms and toilets were dirty as well. All round a pretty bad hostel,2,1
"The clean rooms were about the only thing going for this hostel. I traveled with two other friends and we all generally disliked the vibe of the place. The location is poor (going anywhere of interest required long metro rides or even longer walks), the bar, while reasonably priced for Paris, sold poor beer (warm and flat) and poor food. Better to walk to the supermarkets down the road and buy some cans and a baguette if you want a drink and some food. The place smelled off. Our floor was occupied by about 30 schoolkids which was odd, and impacted quite heavily on the state of our floor's toilets. Despite their claim, this hostel is not a good place to meet people or party, or gain an idea of how to experience genuine Parisian nightlife. Every time we asked for advice on good",2,1
"My boyfriend and I stayed one night here and were miserable! The location of the place is a bit out of the city centre but it was not hard to take the metro to get to tourist places. We had a room on the 1st floor which was on the ground floor - people were smoking all night long outside of our room - there was no air conditioning so our room smelt bad and we got no sleep! The shared bathroom was disgusting! The bathroom looked like it had never been cleaned!! The trash cans were full, there was wet paper towel all over the toilet seat and it smelt bad!! The pub downstairs was overly priced and did not have any prices on the menu. The food was not great and our server got mad at us because we didnt tip him enough. Never staying here again.",1,1
"I stayed here as a 10+ group. One of the rooms we booked stunk of sewerage when my guests entered the room, the hostel were quite good about the situation and offered an alternative however I am still (2 months later) try to get my money back from head office. I am very frustrated and annoyed with the company. I wish I paid more and stayed somewhere a little better.",1,1
"My friend and I, both young girls, came to this hostel as our last stop on a tour of Europe.   Wins the award for this first time I have ever felt unsafe during my travel in Europe (includes getting lost in Amseterdam, missing a train in Hanover, and wandering by myself in Venice)   - directions to the place were very unclear and we ended up wandering around the streets for 20 minutes (where we received MANY very unwelcome passes from men, and an attempted pick pocket)  - waited 20 minutes in line that was 2 deep, watching other employees walk on by into the bar, where we STILL received unwanted passes from people  - when it was our turn we were ratted and afraid, and the counterman gets defensive with us when we explain the directions were flawed. And still only gave attention",2,1
"We booked a ten bed dorm for a friends trip to Paris. When we arrived we were told that we weren't all in the same room and that we should have booked through the room booking email (we had emailed them when we went to book and were told to book online which we did). The staff were unsympathetic about splitting us up and made no effort to rectify the situation. We asked for locks for our locker in the room because we hadn't brought any with us as we thought we would be the only ones in the room and were told we would have to buy them for 10 euro.   This hostel came with breakfast. Which would have been good except that they clearly were not prepared and ran out of bowls, plates, knives, spoons and glasses. We had to queue for over half an hour for cereal...  The staff got",2,1
"We just finished our stay at St chrisophers hostel in Paris and we can honestly disagree with all these wonderful comments! Don't stay here! Wifi is terrible only works in ..one room ..downstairs and verrrrrry slow! Receptionists very rude not willing to help! Breakfast system sucks with lines going out the door! We saw a mouse downstairs!  2 people had told us they had camera and iPhone stolen over 24 hours! No lockers in rooms! Constantly double booking beds , every night was another group of poor people who came home at who knows what hour to a stranger in their beds and ALSO staff had bagged up their belongings and put them at reception? Causing a scene at front desk with many angry guests then just Shipping them all off to a room ONLY offering 10% off their stay! As if that",1,1
Hi. I choose this place because I was organise trip to Paris for 8 people. And they had rooms for 8 so all of my friends could be in one room. I did booking via them website and also call straight away to the hotel to confirm we want to be located all of as in one room. Reception staff confirm my request. When we arrive to the hostel we were located in 2 separate rooms with ruin our trip. I was trying to solve this situation and reception staff was not inform about this request. But is very strange when you booking for 8 people made via one person should be logical to put them in one room. My main reason to choose this place was room for 8 people with other places could offer that. Manager offer as one drink on the house as a apology with we didn't get it and nobody offers as.,1,1
Me and a friend stayed here a few times during our travels our first time was fairly good but when we stayed there a second time the lift wasn't working at all the place had flooded and none of the power circuits worked in our room and the bathroom was quiet dirty overall it's not very good hostel with all the problems it had but the staff were friendly,2,1
"My wife and I stayed at this property for two nights. We had pre-booked a private room with ensuite. We arrived early afternoon, however, unfortunately our room was not ready. A general mood of disorganisation was present at the reception desk. It became apparent that they had overbooked and were attempting to placate and/or relocate aggravated guests. We were told to take our bags to the locker room in the basement and go sightseeing for a couple of hours until our room was ready. The lockers were found to not be operating properly - thankfully an embarrassed staff member was able to assist. Upon our return we were handed our key and dispatched to the fifth floor. Upon entering the room, we were confronted with an unmade bed, soiled sheets, dirty dishes and glasses, used towels",2,1
"I stayed in this hostel for a week with my partner in a private double room. As we were in Paris we decided to shout ourselves some personal space and privacy. What we should have done was go to a middle of the range hotel as we would have got better service and value for money in a cleaner facility. The room we payed for was advertised as ""private room with shared bathroom"" so we were completely prepared for the shared bathroom situation. However what I had imagined was a shared bathroom with perhaps one other couple in a double room also and only we would have access to this bathroom. Instead, we had to share a bathroom with the entire floor of people so all other individuals in the dorm rooms. The bathrooms were dirty and smelt like sewerage all the time. This smell leaked",2,1
"Stayed in a private room with my girlfriend. Bar was a little pricey, food was undercooked and made us both sick. Staff were very helpful but that didn't make up for being so far away unless you caught an expensive taxi. Lack of aircon was appalling, room was constantly hot. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.",1,1
"We stayed at st Christopher's for three nights as recovery after Lagos. The staff were all quite friendly and generally helpful. However that's about the only positive I can think of for this hostel.   I believe the hostel may have opened before it was ready. For starters there was no air conditioning in any rooms/elevators or anywhere besides the bar. The toilets were never properly clean and the showers always flowed out of the cubicle all over the bathroom. The rooms were nice and large but the bunks were not reinforced properly, I felt sorry for the fellow below me, whenever I climbed into bed I guarantee it would shake enough to wake him up. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone until they've finished building it. I can one day see it being a good hostel though.",1,1
"Worst. Unorganised staff. Bookings were messed up we had people in our bed twice, so having to move to other rooms. There was no air ventilation, you can only open a window a crack no fan, no aircon. The bathrooms were always smelly and hot, again no ventilation. I got good poisoning after eating dinner there. Location was quite far away, trains were quite accessible though. If I went back to paris I'd simply pay a little more for something better, if you want to enjoy your time in Paris, probably don't stay here.",1,1
"I find it extremely hard to believe that this is a busabout recommended hostel, most likely is because the busses can park out the front. You could say my stay here was less than enjoyable, actually it was horrible. Ill start with the pros as there are way too many cons:  Pros: Bar and restaurant area is awesome and the bar staff do an awesome job, very friendly and helpful Breakfast is provided and is just ok if you like warm milk Checkin/locker/laundry service is all good  Cons: Our booking was stuffed up despite emailing and calling to confirm all 5 of us were in the same room. I ended up solo in another dorm for the first night. At checkin the staff member was rude and not sympathetic or helpful at all. The cleaners left our main room door and balcony door (accessible by",1,1
"Although this hostel advertises that it is air conditioned, it is NOT. There is air conditioning downstairs in the check in area and in the hallways, but not in the rooms. The windows don't open more than 4 inches and I had a very uncomfortable, hot, sweaty stay at St. Christopher's because of this.   The bed is uncomfortable as well, and we were unable to check in on time because the room aka sauna was not clean yet. Also the communal bathrooms are disgusting and we did not get clean towels during our stay.   There is a discount for the restaurant downstairs, but the food isn't that great and the staff is extremely slow.   Overall I would not recommend this to any friend of mine.",2,1
"Stayed for 10 nights in May in a double room.  Pros: Free Breakfast was good. Hostel was also very secure felt very safe. Supermarket just down the road.   Very far out of the city, especially considering the amount they are charging for a double room. Room wasn't very clean, especially the bathroom which was smelly and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a year. We also didn't get fresh towels in the 10 days we stayed there. Staff were unfriendly and unapproachable. The food at the restaurant was overpriced and not very nice especially the 7Euro special menu. Wi-Fi incredibly temperamental unless you are downstairs in the bar.   You could potentially stay somewhere nicer for a lot less.",2,1
"My friend and I booked this hostel months in advance, we heard from multiple people and read multiple things about it. However it was extremely misleading and contradicting. So I am going to tell you the TRUE FACTS about this place.  Location: -In a bad part of town, I carried pep. spray in my hand at all times. Have to go down a sketchy alley to arrive at location. Is about a 5-8 minute walk from station -It literally is basically outside of the city. We rode the metro in every morning for about 30 minutes.  Room: -The room was clean, however had NO A/C. It was SOOOO HOT and stunk!  -The beds were ok, when one person would get up the entire bunk beds of 6 would move.  -The linens especially the pillows were awful. I used my towel as a pillow, literally bring your own pillow it",1,1
"My friend and I stayed here during a little trip through Europe. I was actually very excited to stay here with all the reviews I had heard. I think maybe we came at the wrong time... when we got there, the lift was broken the whole time we stayed so we had to carry our luggage up & down from the 6th floor. Compared to the other hostels I've stayed in this one seemed to be the hardest to meet people in. The shower was a push shower, where you had to push it every 30 seconds to get it to start again and the water came out like rain drops..very slow. The sheets were very dirty, stains & hair everywhere. Location was far out too from main attractions. Which means more money to spend on transportation. Normally these things don't bother me too much but because we were paying so much",2,1
"This hostel has really nice rooms they are spacious and for the most part clean. The showers are warm, and there is plenty of space to lock up your things. The location is far from the city center about a 25 min metro ride to the Eiffel Tower. The worst part about this hostel is the service. The staff is unfriendly and rude. They are inattentive, it takes hours to get checked in and served. If there is a mistake, there is no compensation or even an apology. The flyers for specials posted in the rooms and through out the bars are out of date. This is irritating when you want to use a promo or special and the bar refuses to acknowledge it. (Even if you take the flyer up to them). Breakfast is only cereal and baguettes. The wifi is poor and the connection is strongest in the bar",2,1
"I was looking for something cheap & easy to stay in with my mum for 2 nights & judging by the reviews I thought St Christopher's would be okay. We got there & the lift was broken so we had to carry our bags up to the second floor. Which was okay, but not easy considering we'd had a long day. We went to sleep & the rooms were hot despite being cold outside. We woke in the morning to find BED BUGS in my Mum's bed. There were SO MANY and some of them large (size of ladybugs). I told staff who refunded the night's stay, moved us to the 5th floor (lift still not working) & told us to leave her clothes in the room as it was to be fumigated. By the time we left the room had still not been fumigated so we had to leave with the clothes that she'd slept in.. Staff were nice & tried to",2,1
St Christopher's had a good size room with a privacy curtain. However the female bathrooms were disgusting. The toilets stink really bad and were not cleaned often. I wouldn't stay at this hostel again,2,1
"I stayed here for a couple of nights. I was impressed with the dorm beds. They are proper built in bunk beds with individual power sockets, reading lights, privacy curtains and huge lockers under the bed. All hostels should be like this!  However, the location is not very nice and I didnt feel entirely safe, and it is quite far out of the city centre. The hostel is a party hostel. Great if you want to party, but not great if you want to sleep as the noise is loud until very early hours and so many people smoke out the front that it came into our room which then also smelt of smoke.   The housekeepers are strange. Twice when I was in the room during the day they came in, closed the curtains and then left and turned out the light, leaving me in darkness! They made my bed on the",2,1
"There restaurant service is atrocious! I sat down in the restaurant/sports bar n grill seating area for over 30min and not single waiter asked me if I wanted a menue or something to drink and that was not the first time. If you want something, you have to holler at the waiter and ask for a menu yourself. You may even have to get up and grab one.   -No A/C in the rooms -Mosquito infested.. even in the restaurant -WIFI only down in the lobby or 1st floor -VERY BAD LOCATION! St. Christophers is all the way out in the boonies so you have to take the metro if you want to get anywhere in Paris Bathrooms and Showers are public. If you take a shower, to keep the shower on you have to keep pressing the button because it is timed and it is only on for about 30seconds.  I would recomend to",1,1
"The good news is that this place is clean, the staff is helpful and its about 5 minutes from the metro. The bad news is that it's in a terrible part of town where I was afraid to walk at night. The hostel also has two sets of bathrooms (for each sex) at opposite ends of the halls so if you get a room at the opposite end of the hall from your bathroom you basically have to do the long walk of shame back to your room after every shower and bathroom break. The rooms, however, have sinks so you can at least brush your teeth in your own room. The rooms are also large but the beds are lumpy and there is lots of noise outside at all hours of the night. The attached restaurant has terribly slow service and even worse food.",2,1
I arrived in my dorm to find everybody being searched by the hostel staff. £200 had been stolen. The staff said they have issues with people walking in off the street and following people into the elevator (it only works with your key card but easy to follow others therefore not need one) then gaining access to rooms and stealing. The problem seems to be that the downstairs is a busy bar and open to the public. I had a terrible stay. The staff were rude and the whole place badly run. I'll never stay in a st Christopher's again.,1,1
"So, my husband and I stayed in Paris for 5 nights and wanted somewhere budget for the first few nights and then planned on splurging for the last two to cap off our European tour.  Where do I begin?  Let's start with the positives - we had a private double and the room was a decent size and the bedding was clean.  The hostel was located close to two convenient metro stops and was located on a nice waterfront.  Security is good - you have to have a room key to access any floor by elevator and there seemed to always be someone at the front desk. Now, the not so positives.  The hostel stunk.  Literally.  Like the bathroom. I don't know about any of the other floors but the 5th floor hallway smelled as soon as you left your room or stepped off the elevator.  The free breakfast is",2,1
"OK, so, where do I begin?  The place is in a REALLY sketchy area of Paris.  The showers/toilets are dirty and nasty - there was a hairball floating around the bathroom for three days - and the staff is extremely rude.  The woman was in there ""cleaning"" and I use this term very loosely at 7:30 in the morning - um, when do people shower - many do in the morning, so probably not the smartest plan.  Plus, she was essentially talking on the phone, she sure as heck wasn't doing her job. Then, when I wanted to dry my hair in the bathroom, she made me unplug my hair dryer so she could pour water all over the place.  The food in the bar is good, but costs too much money for what you get.  Aside from all this, they have an insect problem. I was definitely bitten by a spider while there,",1,1
"I stayed here for a few nights and didn't have a great experience. The hostel itself is clean bit I found the staff to be incredibly and unnecessarily rude. I also got the impression they are out to make money on every little thing possible - luggage storage in particular, which for two days added 20 euro to my stay...and there isn't ant alternative. This just annoyed me. The location isn't great. I wouldn't recommend this place and definitely wouldn't return.",2,1
"I stayed here in January 2012 for three nights. The elevator in the building wasn't working half of the time. The soap in the girls' bathroom and both handicapped bathrooms ran out on our floor early during our stay and was not refilled, though we told the staff about it four times. The bathroom got pretty nasty by the end of the weekend. Breakfast was decent, but the service at their restaurant was awful for dinner. I'll be staying elsewhere next time I'm in Paris.",2,1
"Sitting here on St Patricks Day, Irishman, on my own, away from home on my national holiday. I asked the bar staff a quick question about the possibility of making an local Irish drink. The guy behind the counter refused to even humour me. I felt ashamed of even asking, embarrassed in front of the people around me and even more alone on this Irish of days.   tl:drNice place, bar staff was a jerk, avoid the bar.",1,1
"Stayed at this hostel for 3days, my phone was stolen out of our room even though only we were ""meant"" to have keys; the CCTV was unreliable as it was faulty so we could not prove the thievery. Shower room has no fan so mouldy, damp and smells of old wee. Staff are unfriendly and not helpful. The hostel is in a dodgey area far from central Paris and even saw a couple of drug deals when walking back in the evening. STAY AWAY!",1,1
"I stayed for 4 nights in July 2011. My keycard randomly stopped working twice, so I had to get it replaced. The first time it stopped working was because they had programmed it for a different room to what I was told to stay in (I initially got into my room because the door was open), although I proved what room I was actually meant to be in by giving the staff the sheet they gave me when I arrived, which showed the room number. Later, the keycard stopped working again, and I had to get it replaced again. The staff seemed a bit lazy and rude, not proactively rude, but moreso in the sense of apathy towards the customers - though frankly this seemed quite common in Paris, a city which has an unusual customer service culture. The food on offer was not too good. At around AUD 50/",2,1
"Nice, one minute walk from a lot of shops, takeaways and two metro stations. The hostel gave us baguettes, cereal, Nutella, jam and coffee for breakfast with juices. Just went down in the mornings and helped ourselves. The twin room we booked had peoples shopping receipts under the bed and the floor needed mopping, but the beds seemed clean. Lots of people drunkenly stumbling around at night and in the morning the cleaners like to yell at each other from about 7am until 9ish non-stop. If you want to meet travelers and get drunk, then this is a good place for you. If like me, you want to see Paris in the day time and sleep at night, make sure you are a heavy sleeper. I found it hard to check in because the music was so loud. When you check in you have to pay a 4 Euro deposit for",2,1
"Key cards are not programmed well and simply stop working.   Cleaning ladies make a racket, they come into your room at 10am yell down the halls at each other blare music so you cant sleep.  Our cleaning lady woke up one of the people in our room and yelled at him because apparently the soap dispenser was broken.... its not like he did it!    Day staff are friendly enough.   Cafe staff are terrible they dont serve you you have to go up and get one then they tell you to wait at your table.  Can take up to 30 mins of this dance to get served.     Night staff particulary the guy on reception is rude, arrogant and aggresive.   He is insulting and will not helpful at all.  We tried to ask him where around the area was good to eat and he told us 'its not my job to feed you, go look",1,1
"Key cards were not programed right, and another room key card opened our door! There was a blocked sink in our toilet block for 3 days. Where were the cleaners? Noisy noisy noisy",2,1
"I backpacked around Europe for 4 months staying in all sorts of hostels and this is definitely the worst of the lot! Location: bad! So far away from any where, didn't have any Parisian feel to the location at all! Cost: ridiculous to pay EUR38 for a 6 bed dorm room with out even a ensuite bathroom! Check in: disastrous! 2 Busabout coaches arrived around the same time and I stood in the line for 55 minutes to check in and this is no exaggeration, there were still about 20 people behind me! (I'd been travelling with Busabout for 2 months and no where else had this problem of taking forever to check in a bus full of tired backpackers at 10pm!). Cleanliness: definitely below average! floors in the room were sticky, rooms were smelly, toilets were blocked and there didn't seem to be",2,1
"When I was checking in, the staff we asking a woman on crutches to take 5 flights of stairs to her dorm because their lift was broken - I should have taken this as a sign. The dorm bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned for a week, the beds were little more than mattresses on the floor and the WiFi only works in one room, on one floor just to start. I would not recommend staying here to anyone I any less than fully despise.",1,1
"Stayed here for 5 nights and was not impressed at all.    Good points:  --Great security.  You need your room key to even use the elevator or open the doors onto the floors. --Pretty spacious room for a place in Paris. --Nightlife at the bar is good if you like meeting people or having a place to chill late at night.  There´s a bar and pool table.  It´s also next to the canal, which has some nice restaurants and lots of people picknicking.  Bad points: --There are always long cues, and the staff are very slow and don´t care about you at all.  When we first arrived, the lady at the reception spent a good 5-10 minutes talking to a girl about some boy she´d met last night...while in the middle of checking us in.  She didn´t even try to pretend to multitask, just went and had a chat",2,1
"We booked a private double bed room with shared bathroom for about EUR 90 per night. The room was stuffy and dusty, the pillow was very uncomfortable, basically it was just a small bag filled with some cotton wool. We couldn't sleep well as the hostel is located next to the busy road hence it was very noisy whole night. There are only two bathrooms to serve the entire floor. The toilet cleaner was rude, while I was halfway --- in the toilet cubicle, the cleaner kept knocking the door asking me to get out just because she wanted to mop the floor. The breakfast is very basic and do not expect much - very hard french bread, cereal, juice and coffee. You are lucky if you can get a seat at the cafe in the morning. Nothing fantastic about the hostel location as well, it is far from",1,1
"Stayed for 4 nights in June 2011. Nice room, clean and spacious with a sink. However the staff are too busy with their own social agenda to bother with good service. Always talking and messing around when there are lines of people. Also very rude at times. The linen was scratchy and the pillows weren't even pillows, but instead bags filled with cotton wool. The location is terrible, both in terms of distance from key sights and in socio economic terms! Would never walk around at night! Bathrooms dirty (poo on floor) and showers low pressure and require constant holding of a button for hot water. All in all a terrible waste of money.",2,1
"I can’t recommend staying at St. Christopher. There are a few issues I had with it--the most important one is the location. It is located at the Metro stop Crimee. This is one of the roughest places in the greater Paris area. This is a dangerous area and a known drug neighboorhood. You will feel uncomfortable cause there are hustelers all around the Hostel. Imagine wanting to see Manhattan and realizing that you had unknowingly booked a hostel in the South Bronx. That is what St. Christopher is like. I went for a walk during the evening and was followed by some drug dealers. Not really a relaxing Paris experience. The atmosphere is that of a college dorm room. Its big, loud, and noisy. Doesn’t feel that diverse. I had some of my stuff stolen here as well. There are better",1,1
"I stayed here for 3 nights with a few backpacker friends. We are not picky people and had been traveling for 1 month at 8 different hostels around Europe. St Christophers Inn Paris was by far the worst hostel in almost ever aspect.   Service: Horrible front desk service, line up to check in almost all the time, staff very slow, tried to charge us an extra night each person luckily I had written it down or else they would have just charged us. Waitresses and Bartenders slow..sat for 15 minutes before service, beers never came.   Location: for the price your paying it is not the worst location, but it really isn't near anything. Paris metro system is smelly and not tourist friendly, lines going every which way, so it was very inconvenient.   Rooms: Decent rooms, nice beds with",1,1
"I stayed there for two nights and doubt I will return. I had a great room the first night, but thanks to their booking system I had to move to another room the second night. Separate washrooms for men and women, but each only seems to have TWO showers for the entire floor (100+ people). The location is pretty far out of the way so the only note on that is that you're closer to the CDG airport.  The free Wi-Fi was down the entire time I was there so I had to buy time on one of their terminals. They said it was because they were switching to a new system but I have seen other reviews with similar complaints.  The rooms themselves are decent. Each bed has a curtain for privacy, a light and an outlet. The lockers are terrible! They're under the bed and slide out like a giant cage,",2,1
"When first booking the St Christophers hostel on hostelbookers.com I was overcome with excitement because the reviews were so high. On the hostellbookers website  St. Christophers hostel page was bombarded with, ""Best Hostel in Paris"" and ""Great location"". Well... if I wasn't lied to then someone was extremely exaggerating the truth. St. Christophers hostel was by no means in a good location, BY NO MEANS!! You are going to be on the subway for at least 40 minutes one way to see any of the main tourist attractions. In addition the area around the hostel isn't the greatest, if you are walking all day and just want to relax at a nearby bar you are SOL. They have a bar at the hostel, but prices are high.   In Lehman's terms I would not advise to stay at this hostel, I am an easy to",1,1
"Think about your worst hostel nightmare, multiply that by 10 and you get the St Christopher's Hostel experience in Paris.  The experience has been so bad at every level: 1. They booked my partner and I in separate bedrooms in separate floors. So everyday, my partner would need to come down to my floor for the toiletries in order to take a shower.  2. The elevator was broken for the entire duration of my stay - 7 days 3. The hostel was designed in a way that provides no ventilation - so be prepared for muggy hot summers. There are not even a fan in the room 4. The hostel smells horribly - it smells like sweat from people 5. The personnel is not helpful. The waitress in the restaurant are insubordinate - one of them confronted me after I asked if he could find what happened to a",1,1
"So this place was out of the way, the metro is about a 5 min walk and it's at least another 20 min metro ride to the major sights. When I arrived, we got into our room (double and sharing a bathroom) the room smelled like smoke which was sick, but the bed was comfy, looked clean and the room has a mirror and sink in it, which is nice. I felt like the bathrooms were a joke. It looked like the toilet areas were always clean but there were 3 showers. My first night here, I discovered that the first shower's drain wasn't working properly so it flooded, the second one only had scalding hot water, and the last one was just gross. It's like the girls on the floor were playing some kind of sick joke, ""who can sick as much hair on the walls as possible"" the first day I showered in it",2,1
I only have one thing to say about this hostel: bed bugs. Check your beds and bed frames carefully.  Everything else really doesn't matter after that.,2,1
I booked it through Hostelworld It was the only hostel available for this night. Have stay 1 night there The location is sketchy in the middle of ghetto I feel to be in the Bronx or Inglewood CA. It's a new and great building. It was expensive.,2,1
Watch out if you stay here as my sister and I had money stolen from a locked bag in our hotel room. Not a good start to our holiday.   Otherwise it is a fairly standard hotel in a good location close to the Gare de Lyon,1,1
"My friends chose this hotel due to budget limitations but I was rather disappointed. The hotel itself is very close to the city with an underground station right across the street. There are also many shops and cafes nearby. The hotel however would benefit from some renovation. My room was very small and smelly and there was mould in my bathroom tiles, probably because the window cover in the bathtub was very small, spilling water everywhere. Their elevator is very tiny and barely fits three people in. Their staff were friendly with the exception of a man who was very unwelcoming and rude. I asked to print my boarding pass to which he rolled his eyes and scoffed. I stared blankly and asked where I could get a printer. He sent me downstairs but their printer didn't work and I was",1,1
"Place was a total dump. I wouldnt put farm animals in it.  I asked for a quiet room AWAY from lifts...so they put me right next to one. Theres no soundproofing, no carpets so you hear every little noise.   All the facilities are communal. Reception staff were nonchalont. Uninterested. They took all personal info without good reason. Place is totally grim.   The room was disgusting. Old cheap ass furniture, no carpet, dirt and grubby marks on the walls and flaking paint.  Showers and pipework were disgusting. Dirty. Like a rugby club bath house. I didnt use any of the facilities. There were communal kitchens and some crockery and room fridge provided. Obviously i used nothing.  Noisy. Impossible to sleep. Avoid at all costs. Only reason i stayed was because of the temporary bus",1,1
Noisy. Dirty shared bathrooms. But you get what you pay for and it’s fantastic value for money.   Felt like I needed a bath after using the shower.   However at £40 for central-ish London next to a tube station it’s an absolute steal.   London is an idiotic city anyway,2,1
over the last two years since I discovered this hostel I have stayed around five times because it is not as expensive as hotels in London and I needed to save a few pounds as we all do given how expensive London can be. There is cleaning there which is good but it is manned by well male not polite staff (not sexist just fact). Occasionally polite but mainly not and I get a distinct feeling that we are filmed in our rooms due to some comments I heard from a staff member talking near me. I have had some politeness but a few times the opposite.   The facitlits are a room with cutlery and plate and mug plus a kitchen nearby and shower room and toilets. They are clean usually. But staff are very unhelpful if something goes wrong eg kettle not working I went to reception and he did,1,1
"We opened the dorm door and it smelt like something had died in there. We booked the 4 beds the room had (room 409) thinking we would have our own room. Unfortunately we were not alone as the room had rats crawling around the ceiling space. We think the smell was rat urine. Showers were filthy, with a smeggy film over the floor. We felt cleaner before we showered. I've stayed in dumps, in third world countries and nothing compared to this. Absolute health hazard.",1,1
"Worst place I've ever stayed, dirty, uncomfortable rooms and the toilets and shower were awful - the kitchen had no utensils, staff are useless and couldn't care less about anything - guests were too noisy and filthy, spend more money elsewhere and avoid here like the plague.",1,1
"If your staying one or two nights it's grand, tbh it's not that noisy as in living room closed at 11pm, however main problem definately is people getting kicked out without any apparent proper reason and also middle Eastern staff who are on a power trip, don't book for long term",2,1
"Would not EVER stay here again, or recommend it. However, if you enjoy grumpy, rude staff, boiling hot rooms, the heady & constant waft of illegal substances being smoked inside and outside rooms, groups of men smoking & shouting at each other outside into the late hours, having food stolen from your room by someone with access to your room key while you're out, and Reception staff who don't care when you raise illegal drugs & theft issues, then you've hit the jackpot!",1,1
"Got a private “deluxe” double room but there was nothing deluxe about it. I’m not a snob in any way, but I was expecting at least a bed, not a mattress placed on a wooden base. The room was no more than 10 square meters big, so it’s good for bonding with your partner. You can hear absolutely everything through the paper thin walls, so you can bond with guests in other rooms as well. The place is a 4-minute walk from Hammersmith underground station, a Tesco and loads of great restaurants. If you need a place to just spend the night, that’s the accommodation for you.",2,1
Went there on summer camp. The rooms are quite small. It is ok-ish for cleaning. The owners are not really nice. I was insulted by some of the people staying for the night. Very noisy place. The location is not bad.,2,1
"The only positive thing during the stay was that the room was clean, the fridge we had in our room worked and it was near Hammersmith station. Everything else were so bad. The guys at the counter were extremely rude, they didn't greet us when we arrived and looked upset like we interrupted their conversation or something. Our room were on the bottom floor and the window we had were located in their ""indoor garden"" so we could hear the staff talk. The walls were so thin we could hear everything outside, from the guests on the hall and the room next door.",1,1
"Stayed in a bunk room that had some flooding issues.  The windows did not close.  The doors slammed.  The closest toilet was 2 hallways away, and shared by 15 rooms.  Small coed shower rooms that didn't have a changing area and was not clean. Do not stay on the 4th floor if you stay here.",2,1
"Absolutely disgusted with the way the staff treated me and my family member today, they asked for proof of Id and threw my passport out of there little box, disrespectfull staff that really need to sort there attitudes out",1,1
What can i say. Yes there are more expensive places in town. But more effort could be made.  Its dirty. I can smell what could be illegal substances. When they write self catering they mean you need to buy your own cooking utensils...  The staff seem to think it is funny. Sigh.  Next time i will read reviews before i blindly book somewhere.,1,1
"I have be staying at the Abercorn House over the last six years at least 4-7 times a year as I travel frequently to London for conferences. This will be my last visit. Conditions of the place are as described in many reviews, basic and minimal. However, over the last few visits staff seem to become more and more rude with absolutely NO EFFORT given to making you feel welcomed. I don't expect a red carpet at this price point but I also don't expect to be treated like a nuisance for asking for information when I choose your establishment to spend my money. At this price point there are many other options in London and I will taking my business elsewhere moving forward.",2,1
"The room was too, too small. Extremely tiny. Minimal amenities provided except liquid soap in bathrooms and a microwave thankfully. The staf at reception seemed bored with the job and least interested in mincing words out of his mouth. Though they did allow us to store luggage before check in at no additional cost.",2,1
"Booked a ""double bed"" with my girlfriend, instead got two flimsy single beds that came apart faster than you could say - sheet! The place is a bit of a joke, but then Hammersmith Apollo is around the corner so it makes sense. Not going back.",1,1
"Had a booking for 7nights, checked in to MY room for the first 3 nights then got told to move out of MY room for someone else and I got put in to the worse looking room possible. Had no space at all my bags when I walked in, the floor was filthy and disgusting, stains all over the place and the staff just started to stretch and act as if nothing was wrong when I told them I want something else. Completely disappointed in this place.",1,1
"I hate to leave a bad review because the staff was so nice but... It's like the management is only doing the minimum, if that.  Beds are very cheap and horribly SQUEAKY. We booked a private twin but were given a 4 bed bunk room with very little space.  Showers had no shelves or hooks which makes no sense for a shared shower space. Kitchen - I wouldn't use it. TV room / common room is shut away and not very comfortable.    I wouldn't recommend for solo travelers who like meeting others on their trips.  We did like the location, though. And, of course, the staff was very friendly.  Not sure who owns or manages this but they need to step up their game.",2,1
We slept one night in the hostel and it wasn't clean. There were a terrible smell in corridor and stains on sheets. There were no hook or table to put clothes in showers and everything was wet. I don't recommend.,2,1
"I stayed at Abercorn House for a night just over two weeks ago, with my son. When we first arrived we were pleased to find friendly staff, a good sized room, and the hostel seemed very clean. However, lying in bed reading that night, I noticed an insect on my pillow. When I squashed it, to my horror blood squited out. I few minutes later I noticed another. When I lifted my pillow, three more were crawling along the edge of my mattress (the sheet didn't quite reach).I went down to reception and asked to change rooms. I was told that there were none free, but was offered an extra sheet! Obviously I didn't sleep. I spent the night squashing bugs as they approached me. Most were filled with blood. In the morning, exhausted and horrified, I went back to reception (with some",1,1
"Upon arriving, you have to pay the end of the deposit before being allowed into the room (which is fair). However, there is no easy access lift, and we were not directed to one. We had made our booking over a month in advance (two twin rooms), and had asked them to put a mattress in one of the rooms two weeks before our trip for a new depend coming with us. Upon arrival, we were informed that they had messed up our booking and gave us two double-bed rooms. They entirely forgot about the mattress, and told us that one of us could just sleep on blankets. When we protested, they agreed to bring up the mattress by six. We ended up waiting in the room until half eight before the mattress arrived. We also had medication for a disabled friend that needed to be refrigerated. The fridge",2,1
"Staying here with my my mum as it was the cheapest option for Wimbledon. We booked a twin room with a fridge. Shared bathroom. We were really happy when we first arrived. Room was clean & bright. Until the door slamming starts! It’s honestly horrendous. Woke me up constantly in middle of night. There’s no signs telling people to be aware of this. We were careful to let doors close quietly but then what’s the point when nobody else gives a toss? You can also hear every word people say in corridor & it echos.  It’s a shame as it’s the only real negative about the place as it is a 5 min walk from Hammersmith underground, clean, friendly & cheap. Unfortunately though - unless you wear ear plugs, you won’t get a good sleep. It’s 7.03 just now. I’ve been up since 0530. Wish I could",2,1
"I have stayed here twice.  The first time was alright, a large room, relatively clean but the place was terribly noisy.  This time, however, we were in a shoebox that was far too small for two people and made intolerable by the warm weather – there was no fan and no air con obviously so we had to leave the window open all night therefore exposing ourselves to the gobshite neighbours (ear plugs proved unsatisfactory).  The bed was so soft that every time I moved I woke my partner up and the bathroom was so small that you actually had to squeeze past the sink just to sit down on the toilet; if you’re overweight you might actually seriously struggle (I’m not joking by the way).  The place is very noisy too, doors are slammed shut with little thought to residents, the walls are rice",2,1
"It is one of the worst places where I have stayed. First of all, all the workers are foreigners and they are chaing everyday the rules in the hostel. I can not imagine that they are charching extra for internet. You pay £1 per hour. Even you pay for the internet you cannot open all the web sites. Some web sites are blocked and can't be opened. The TV room is a disaster. It is smelling very bad and not confortable at all. The corridors are smelling very very bed. The room was very dirty. Ther is nothing available in the cafeteria. I don't want to say anything about the toilots, kitchen and shower areas. The is no chance to keep you healt after staying here. This is more dirty pension the a host that we know.",1,1
"If you are a bat and don’t want to sleep during the night, this is the perfect place to be! The room was clean and tidy. The mattress was very uncomfortable and very bad quality. Also very rude staff...",1,1
"I only stayed one night because was horrible!! Very dirty rooms, very dirty bathrooms and it smells like pee. Moreover, there was a dirty sock from the previous customer and the bad sheets had blood... and when I took a shower there was not hot water... it was a horrible experience!!! DONT GO TO THIS HOSTEL!!! And if you go there you have to pay with cash because they don’t admit credit card!!!",1,1
We stayed in this hostel as we were attended a gig at the Hammersmith apollo so wanted somewhere close and cheap for one night. The accommodation was very cheap by London prices bt for a reason. The window in our room was smashed and covered up and the room was as small as it could be to fit in a bed and a tiny wardrobe. The bathrooms are communal but clean. Many of the residents apear to live there?! And little English is spoken at the front desk. It suited ok for one night but I wouldn't stay any longer.,2,1
"If you’re looking for a really low budget stay and you don’t mind being woken up by other guests in the middle of the night multiple times, or after ‘cleaning’ your room, finding all of your belongings left previously on the bed thrown into a corner on the ground, or sleeping in stained bedsheets, or having to use a towel with weird yellow stains on it, than this is your place to go! The walls are paper thin, the doors don’t seal well and the beds are rolling on wheels during the night when you turn around in your bed. The bathroom and the common kitchen were okay. The staff gave 0 fck that you might sleep longer than 6am and shouting around to each-other in the corridors as well as doing the loudest possible type of cleaning: vacuuming.",2,1
"The room was fine, the wall of the room was hin though. the bathrooms were clean. The location is good, too. But the most of the receptionists were really not friendly.  I got sick early in the morning on the day of departure and even called an ambulance. As the doctor said, I should rest and not fly on that day, I decided to stay there for another night. I called them and the room was available. But they made me to go down to reception immediately and pay, saying otherwise they give the room away. I barely could move at that time. When I was finally at the reception to pay, they told me they don’t accept credit cards. They made me to go back to my room, get cash and come back. They could have been nicer and more flexible.",2,1
"Absolute rubbish. Stayed in a single room for a night and could not close an eye whole night. Noise, noise, noise. Doors banging all night, people partying in the garden untill late hours. Very rude staff. No TV in the room, no free WI-FI. Not a single positive thing about my stay. Look elsewhere regardless of price.",1,1
So I came on Monday morning around 9:45 am and i was told i can check in only after 12.  And despite so many people checking out they couldn’t get a bed ready for me.  Even aftr waiting for more than 2 hours.  Horrible mistake booking this place.,1,1
"Spent a couple of night with a friend, and came to this house wich is well placed (near Hammersmith underground station) and is cheap. Well, it's cheap, for sure. We had a two beds room (with a fridge), toilets and shower were in the commons. All is old and rustic, almost spartiat. The only way to get fresh water is to go to toilets (even in the kitchen there is only hot water). Not too annoying at a first glance as we were just here to sleep. And here started the problems. No blind, and the shade can't really block the sunlight right on the bed at 5:00 am. No soundproofing, meaning EACH noise in the corridor is well-eard in the room : slapped doors, voices, radio alarms, etc. We were awaken each morning around 6:00 am, even with ear protections. The hotel can't be charged for",2,1
"I booked a double en suite room on the 1st May 2017 with Agoda.com. On my confirmation it stated I would pay at the Hostel, little did I know that Abercorn took my payment two days later on the 3rd May 2017. I don't always check my statements! But to top it off, when I arrived they never had my room so they had to accommodate me in a ground floor basement studio flat in Bayswater. They did transport me there in a Cab, Admittedly this was furnished to a high standard but I wasn't supplied with not even a glass,plate knife or fork even though it had a microwave & cooker. So the moral of the story is even though you have paid it doesn't mean your going to get to stay where you wanted to.",1,1
"The manager of this hotel has a bad attitude, unhelpful, and dam right rude. We stayed for a total of 5 nights from the 20th of July, two twin rooms for myself and my work colleagues. The rooms are filthy, dated and in need of a total refurbishment. Staff need training on their customer service skills and the manger should reconsider his vocation as working with the general public obviously offends him.",1,1
"DO NOT BOOK THIS PLACE - booked a 2 night stay and paid in full in advance.  Unable to use the first night as delayed with travelling, phoned and advised the hostel.  Arrived on Saturday at 11pm exhausted only to learn that room had been re-sold and was full.  The room had been paid for in ADVANCE... at 3am offered a disgusting room, a bed that had been slept in and sheets not changed, pants and socks in the bed already!!!!! NASTY - JUST NASTY - Not even worth the 1 star, sadly you can't post without it!!!   Oh and lots of comings and goings with single men and multiple different women - make of that what you will",1,1
We knew it wouldn't be luxury but we just wanted a bed to sleep in - we weren't going to spend our time in the room. We had booked a double room with shared toilet/shower facilities. The room itself was ok and equipped with a fridge. The bed was not good - the buttons in the mattress poked into our backs and legs. To get a hot shower you need to get up REALLY early or late in the evening. It was really difficult to get a good nights sleep because of people slamming the doors and as there are tile floors everywhere sound travels really easy.,1,1
"First off the location is great being close to the underground and close to the Olympia Exhibition Hall which is where I needed to be for the two days.  Staff were not very polite.  Room very basic with uncomfortable bed and loud at night times.   Shower rooms very dirty and not kept up together very well.  All in all I would not stay again, even for the low price I paid.",2,1
"I've stayed in many hostels in many different countries and have never been so disappointed. The room was not only bare bones, but there was no box spring on the bed- only two mattresses on top of one another. I wouldn't even complain about this if the mattress was at least comfortable, but instead, you would sink in wherever you laid down! The dirty mattress was covered by a flat sheet that wasn't sized correctly, so it often came undone. (No fitted sheet) This is not the type of mattress you would want to be touching without a sheet to act as a protective barrier.... although you found some comfort in having a sheet between you and the filthy mattress, the sheet provided was also not clean! We found several hairs on the sheets which did not belong to me or my boyfriend! There",1,1
"From start to finish this place was pretty poor accommodation.  Positives:  - Good enough location if you intend on going to the Olympia Exhibition Hall as it's about a 20 minute leisurely walk.  - Within range of some nice places to eat and drink both low and slightly higher end.  - The floor looked clean enough   - Soap dispensers on the wall in the shower and by the sink.  - fridge in my room   - common areas reasonable clean  Negatives:  - I was volunteering at an event at the Olympia Hall and there was an social media group set up for us all to discuss various things. I happened upon a post that mentioned this accommodation and the fact that they had overbooked. and were turning people away or moving them over half an hour away to another hotel. Now, I realise this is",1,1
"there was a live baby cockroach in my bed & this was the noisiest hostel i've eve stayed in, world wide. when i told the front desk about the cockroach, they offered to clean the room or transfer me to another room. i just couldn't stay there, though. instead, i left the hostel and was told to ask the manager about a refund. i tried for days to contact him, 2 staff members guaranteeing that he'd take my call or email me back, which, to date, he has not. it's been over three weeks. DO NOT STAY HERE unless you like bugs and noise",1,1
"I've been to many hostels during my studies so I knew what to expect from an hostel. Of course you don't get comfort and all the strings attached but at least hostels are a great opportunity for socialising (and saving money). Well this hostel is not. The common rooms are non existent. Kitchens too small. We didn't socialise with a single person in 5 days.   Furthermore the bathrooms and showers were very cold (and shared with at least 40 people per floor).   At night there is a mess you can hear every single door of your flat slamming open and closed.  Rooms are too small, especially the four bed room, enough for 1 or 2 days but not for more.  Wi-Fi is supposed to be paid extra 5 pounds for only  5 hours of connection per week.  Staff is really really rude and they don't do",1,1
"We stayed at this hostel for NYE in London. It's a 5 minute walk from Hammersmith station so thats a good thing. It's basically the only good thing this hostel offers. The floors are sticky, the walls are dirty and the toilets won't all flush that good.   Service is also not that great. When we bought a travel adapter they all did not work and because there was only one guy at the check in desk we had to grab it in the shop ourself en take it to the desk.   All in all, a fair price for this mediocre place.",1,1
"Firstly when we arrived to check in we were advised the card machine wasn't working so we had to go find and take out cash, very inconvenient and impractical. Next we were shown to our room with a private bathroom which we got but the room was located next to the reception area and across the narrow hall the kitchen, so an ideal place to guarantee lots of noise and little chance of sleep due to the very noisy guest and rude staff.  Next the sheets on the 'double bed' (two singles which hadn't been zipped up) were dirty and full of hair....see attached pic. Upon requesting they be changed the receptionist asked me why? Isn't it obvious that we want clean sheets to sleep on? So eventually we got some cleaner sheets but still didn't feel 100% clean and comfortable. Only saving",1,1
"Booked to stay four nights as a pair. First off we were expected to pay in full on arrival prior to viewing the room. On pulling back the bed sheets we found pubic hair and nail clippings. The floors were sticky throughout and with hygiene standards well below par we returned to the reception to request a refund. The staff were extremely rude, dishonest and unhelpful. Several attempts were made to contact any kind of manager, we were given a time to return the following day but were met with the excuse that the manager was in fact out of the country. Exhausted and disheartened we accepted a 2 night refund, despite never actually staying.  We were visiting my sister in london and with our accommodation budget only partly returned we were left to couch surf for the entirety of the",1,1
"Stayed in room one week beginning 31st October. Staff very rude. Accidentally left something in the room which seems to have disappeared now!!  Called hotel & was asked to call back later, 6 phone calls later & my property has not been found.  I have no been blocked from leaving reviews via Booking.com!!",1,1
"The staff members at the reception are simply disrespectful, ignorant and grumpy the whole time. If you need any help, you bett find solutions on your own.  Not only that it's noisy in the morning (slamming doors, construction area next to the building, thin walls), the Wifi costs extra (very rare in hotels(hostels).  The rooms are poorly decorated, no TV, no table lamps) and the beds are uncomfortabe since they are too soft to sleep properly.  All in all, I wouldn't recommend visiting this place, cause there are far more comfortable places for this prize!",1,1
"- The service (both reception and cleaners) do not speak good english and are rude. - Rooms are so noisy; doors make a lot of noise when closing and there is a lot of people in the corridors, as well as people walking. No soundproof at all. There was also noise from outside because there is a building site under construction in the same street. - There is nothing to hang your clothes while having a shower. - WiFi is not free; they charge you if you want to use WiFi. + The hostel is 2min walking from Hammersmith Tube & Bus Station. + There is a minimarket with food in the reception with really good prizes.",2,1
"The mattress had a hole in the middle and I was unable to sleep. Besides that the noise from the people, the doors etc was unstoppable especially during the night. The tiny room is like jail with a small window.  The stuff wasn't polite. If you want a place to sleep during the night, like a normal person, this is not the right one. If you are vampire this is it!!",1,1
If you want to sleep in this hostel you must wear ear plugs or you must be deaf. They are trying to keep it clean the common areas but  the cleaning stuff was extremely rude. Definitely I don't recommend it,1,1
"Location is a gem. Only 3 minutes walk from the underground and bus stations, shops and cafes. 15 minutes underground ride to Piccadilly. Staff unfriendly, no welcome whatsoever. Wifi 1£ for 1hour. We have stayed in 2 beds room, with refrigerator, plates, cups, forks, knives and spoons. Kitchen and facilities are shared-lots of kitchens (with microwave, toaster and coffee machine) on each floor but not all of them had working devices. They do clean every day, change bed lining every second day. Also, the walls are very thin so it can be very loud in the night.  Hostel is cheaper than some in the same range  and I would say 'good value for the money' but it's just not - staff should be much nicer, and it is only cheap because things are old or broken, and of poor quality.",2,1
Ok the floors were clean...that's the only good thing...had a double room more like a cupboard..tiny on suite bathroom...no kettle so i had to buy one as i didn't want to keep tracking to the kitchen...which only had a cooker fridge and kettle in it no utensils...no TV in room good job i had my tablet with me £1 an hour for internet...no breakfast....hot room...i definatly would never EVER stay here again...not even if you paid me....,1,1
"REGRETTABLE, I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYTHING.  I had a reservation for four nights, but I got sick the previous day and I couldn`t take my flight.  I canceled the reservation and send medical evidence, but still they refused to refund me the amount of any of the four nights.  DE PENA, NO LO RECOMIENDO PARA NADA. Tenía una reserva para cuatro noches, pero enfermé el día anterior y no pude tomar el vuelo.  Cancelé la reserva, pero aún así se negaron a devolverme el importe de ninguna de las cuatro noches.",1,1
"When we checked in at 3.00pm the room wasn't ready and the floor was wet.  Unhelpful & Rude Staff -The Housekeeping were shooting at each other at  8AM in the morning and people slamming doors through out the night. The noise kept us awake all night until we finally couldn't take anymore, dressed and went and complained and the receptionists were not helping at all, very rude and ignorant!  DON'T waste your time and money-AVOID!!",1,1
"Hostel was clean and tidy. TV room and Garden were nice. I was staying in a private room with a bathroom and the bathroom showers were great. The rooms had a fridge and crockery. Plus plenty of wall sockets. Excellent location near Hammersmith tube station and shops.  On arrival I stood waiting to be served, there were two men on the check in desk. One was serving the other appeared busy. The first man then finished serving but did not serve me but put his head down. I waited but they did not serve me for several minutes. If they were busy with would have been polite for them to acknowledge me and say they would be a moment.  Once being served I was told there was a problem with my room (a private twin) and that I would need to go to another hostel in central London. I was not",2,1
We got in late and the room reserved for us was the last remaining one.  Unfortunately they had messed up the reservation and it was a room with one bed not two.  Shower was tiny.  Room overlooked the patio and was incredibly noisy.  Had to leave windows open as it was HOT. I now know much more about 2 drunken men's love lives than I could ever wish  Just generally loud and awkward.,2,1
"Abercorn House Hostel has the potential to be good value for money and has a great location in terms of the underground and in Greater London.  I stayed twice at this Hostel: in 2015 and in July 2016.  The place is rising in one direction: in noise and grotty rooms!  We paid 52 pounds sterling for a double room with private bathroom, so it wasn't cheap.  Imagine our horror when we find the bed sheets appeared to have been used before our stay: hairs all over the sheets and a wet patch that smelled of urine.  The common areas like TV room are kept relatively clean.  Being opposite the TV room and common bathroom and some meters away from the firedoor meant slamming and creaking noises for most of the night.  Every time these doors opened and closed our room door rattled",1,1
"Worst customer service I've ever encountered, nothing can be worse than this. Everything has a price, every single thing, very annoying.   The guys at the counter are very rude, they don't appreciate their customer at all, and didn't look like they are willing to improve at all.  Other than the location is near to Hammersmith station, there is nothing else good about this hostel.  Totally not recommended if you want a pleasant stay in London.",1,1
"So, there is a bed and a shower. But that's about it. The clerks are as friendly as the usually are in London. Not.  The room seems clean but i found a q-tip that was not ours, and the floors were dirty.  The blinding does not cover the entire window, so by 6:00h it was bright. The fridge smelled of chees even though we never had chees in it, and if someone in the hallway or the next room talked, you understood every word. And as a topping: our room was directly over the smokers area. Do whenever people smoked we had to close our window. I would advice you to ask for a room that isn't into the back jard.   On the plus side: we've seen worse in london and the hostel is located close to the hammersmith station.",2,1
"The room was so small,at the ground floor, 40 degrees with no AC, bugs on the floor and bed, we had to leave the window opened and there were people smoking and shouting outside at all hours who could see us naked, a bird fell off in our room, the builders in front of us were refurbishing, starting at 7 am and waking us up and all the polluted air was coming through the window. The staff didn't care, I asked to check out after the first day and have the rest of the stay refunded; they just say they can't, without offering any solution. They were so rude to me, but flirting with my girlfriend when she went by herself to ask for some towels, can you believe that?!! The Housekeeping just came inside the room while we were sleeping, without apologising, claiming we HAD TO give them",1,1
"Stayed Friday 3rd June - Sunday 5th June 2016 Room was cramped, no bedside light and had a musky smell either from damp or poor ventilation. I was overcharged on my room and placed in room 22 which had a window on the ground floor over looking the communal smoking area. I arrived late on the Friday evening around 2am and from the moment I arrived until 6.30 am there were drunk revellers outside smoking, drinking and taking drugs in the smoking area. The noise kept me awake all night until I finally couldn't take anymore, dressed and went and complained. Only then did the staff do something and remove the guests. Worst nights sleep in a long time. Sheets were poorly fitting to bed and kept coming off the mattress and I found a number of hairs in the bedding. The room looked",1,1
"I stayed here in the beginning of April.  Upon arriving I noticed I printed out list of rules and information about the hostel to the right side of the check-in desk.  Second to last on this list said:  ""No Smoking:  It is against the law to smoke in these premises.""  Normally that would be perfectly fine for me since I don't smoke; however the desk personnel was standing at the entrance to the check-in area chatting with another gentleman and smoking.  The whole bottom floor reeked of cigarettes.  If you're going to forbid guest from smoking at least have the decency to not do so yourself!  In addition to the smoking and chatting with someone, it took the man meant to check me in at least 3 minutes to acknowledge that I was there.  His companion could clearly see me standing",2,1
"Received an Emergency Phone call on Hotel at 11:50p.m. heard a banging on the wall, realised that it might be too loud as the walls are thin.  Walk down two floors to talk to receptionist to ask him where could I talk (as the reception area is small) who gesticulated in a rude way to wait my turn.  Waited my turn without talking to the person still on the Phone call from Overseas.  Talk to receptionist and politely asked him is there a location to talk.  He pointed again rudely to go to T.V. room.  I went to the T.V. room but there were two people watching TV.  I went back to reception and sat on the two chairs to do my phone call.  The receptionist talk to me (you might say scream to me: ""I did not authorise you to stay here and talk"".  I standed and said: You did not authorise",1,1
"As a solo female traveller I requested a room with other women if possible  and due to health conditions I asked, with plenty of notice, that they kindly keep a bottom bunk for me. The men at reception were friendly enough on arrival. However in my 4 bed room were 2 men, who had both taken the bottom bunks. My only option was to sleep on the floor between two men or upgrade to a private room. At £20 extra per night this was kind of worth doing. However the room was too hot, soulless and right by the elevator. The elevator was noisy enough but the bedroom doors are noisy too, thank good as for a white noise app on my phone! Mobile internet signal is poor so you have to pay extra for the wifi. Good kitchen facilities and the best bathroom I have seen in a hostel but I just didn't",1,1
"Awful place. Small room, no pictures up, felt like a prison room and had blood stains on the matresss. Dont stay here if you have any standards. Trades under hammersmith rooms (to get you to book) and then tells you in confirmation its a hostel.",1,1
"I was at this hostel for one night and I decided to move out the day after. The stink was everywhere and terrible.  The bathroom (which is shared) was right by my room so that I could hear the footsteps of the people all night long without sleeping.  As I opened the window plenty of flies flew in my room, and there was also a deep hole by the radiator. Finally, the curtain was partially broken so that I had to call the reception to fix it. At least the bed-sheets were clean.",1,1
"My trip started with a very unpleasant situation. I arrived a bit earlier than the check-in time and wanted to left my luggage first and go out. After arriving the man at the reception told me that ""there was a problem with my reservation, the first night's stay"". As I had read on this portal a story of a man who had been told his reservation had been cancelled and he had been recommended  another hotel, a more expensive and worse one, I immediately told the guy that I disagree to make any changes to my reservation for the first night (especially as I had plans for the day and was in a hurry so it was impossible for me to find time for looking for another place to sleep). The guy then told me ""OK, I will sort this out"" and refused to speak to me anymore and tell me what it was",2,1
Had my 11 year old with me when I was told they had given my room away and they had no other rooms. Ended up having to spend the night on a bench at Gatwick airport. If you actually want a room don't book with Abercorn.,1,1
"They put their reservation under a non refundable booking. Tried cancelling 2 weeks in advance, do not allow us to cancel and charge us the full fee. I was willing to pay ANY cancellation fee except the full price. Not very willing to help us on the phone.",1,1
"I am a 50 year old lady travelling Europe and London being expensive we decided to stay in the 'outer' suburbs but somewhere hear enough to transport it wouldn't be an issue and this hostel covers that aspect perfectly. We could hop on a train within a three minute walk brilliant. Now the rooms - we stayed on level two and the stairs are not a drama. The hostel itself always looked clean to me - we stayed three nights/four days. The room we had comprised of two single beds, one wardrobe, a bar fridge and a bathroom everything you could possibly need - BUT the beds were crap - really uncomfortable to the point I could feel the springs digging into me, when we opened the wardrobe the left hand door almost fell off so we didn't use it, bathroom was fine but a shower prior to 7am is",2,1
"As they say very convenient, room bedding towels all clean, room kitted out by Ikea, then you have the communual facilities sharing is fine if you share the same standards as other guests who treat it like a hotel and obviously expect someone running around after them clearing up their mess! Also makes for a noisy night life people in and out of rooms assume to use the facilities.  Why I wouldn't return, we had a fridge in the room that was great and handy, only issue on returning from a evening out was putting on the lights exposed our other room mates roaches who'd infested the nice warm damp dark part at the back of the fridge!  As stated you get what you pay for so dont expect too much won't be geading back in a hurry if at all.",2,1
"This has to be the most disgusting place I have ever had to stay in my whole life.No working lift,urine everywhere,other random cloloured stains,shared dirty toilets and shower rooms,shouting and banging all night,to be fair I should have been paid danger money to have been there!!!",1,1
"The hostel itself is conveniently placed 2 minutes from Hammersmith underground and bus station, it's newly refurbished and clean but the pros end here. The staff were very rude and not helpful at all. For the money we paid we didn't get a good value - the room did have a fridge but no table where you could actually eat. The kitchens are fully fitted but there are no pots or pans. What's more the wifi isn't free, it costs £1 per hour (sic!). All over, I definitely wouldn't recommend this place. are f",2,1
"The only thing good about this place is its location. Beautiful park around the corner, couple of pubs down the road for a pint and extremely close to the bus stop and underground station. However, everything else was appalling... Shocking service, crappy and dirty room, disorganized cafeteria and don't get me started on the wifi... Utterly ridiculous... Expensive and slow... Please find another place, don't stay here",1,1
"We indicated on our initial booking we would be arriving after 9pm but when we arrived we were told our booking had been cancelled due to an issue with our card payment. They found us 2 rooms for that night after much pleading and we paid with the  same card they had had ""issues"" with earlier. We were left with no where to stay for our second night and the staff kept telling us to come back in case something came up which wasnt very helpful as we had plans for the saturday. The staff were really unhelpful and the hostel itself is really noisy.",1,1
"Unfortunately my opinion of Abercorn has been smeared by the treatment of my partner and I on our fourth night of accommodation. On our third evening of staying at this Hostel, our circumstances changed and required us to stay another night in London. The receptionist was happy to take an extra £50 off us for another lodging. We went out for the next day and came back to Abercorn, went to our room and all of our possessions had been removed. Basically, someone had come into our room rifled through our private belongings and haphazardly shoved them into our bags. We went to reception and it took them three seconds to check the computer system and note that we did, in fact, pay to stay for another night. We got little apology and were told that “it wasn’t their fault” and that “it",2,1
Very dirty. The service was behind a glass not doing much. They didnt even welcome us. The first thing they said was to pay. Inside the room we found a guy that was sleeping with a guest which is not allowed. Also we found a towel which was pissed by someone.The bathroom was also very dirty,1,1
"The good: - Good position, 5 minutes to Hammersmith bus and tube stations, in the middle of a lively district with lots of restaurants and pubs. Kensington and Hyde Park within walking distance. - Common bathrooms and ambients are clean; lots of kitchens.  The bad: - Cockroaches in room - small, not many, but still about one bug squished every night. - Expensive wi-fi (1 pound per hour? in 2015? seriously?) - Tragically noisy construction works in the morning - Unfriendly personnel - Poor money-value ratio",2,1
"I stayed in this hostel for 3 nights, the first thing I found wrong with this hostel was the window in my room was broken and you could not close it I was not to worried about this until the noise from the construction next door started, also this hostel advertises a kitchen where you can cook you own food but does not provide a single pot, pan, bowls, or cooking utensils (so if you plan to cook here you better bring your own pots and pans) also there is no free wifi you will have to pay £1 per hr to use it, the rooms has no TVs in them and the staff are unhelpful, I would not bother staying here.",2,1
"Upon entering the premises everything seemed alright, clean, decent facilities which included vending machines, laundry area, a kitchen and a communal area.  However, after dropping my bags off in my room and going out into London and returning to the hostel at about 11pm ready for bed I walked through the corridor which I can only describe as a Sauna.  I am sure this wasn't included on the hostels list of facilities because a corridor did seem a strange place to put your sauna, but I thought nothing of it intially thinking surely my room would be cooler with in being 2015 and the invention of air conditioning.  But I was wrong! In fact the room was hotter or at least equally as hot as the corridors!    My room was situated on the ground floor and although I did have the option",1,1
"I stayed with my fiancée last week for 5 nights and it was the worst accommodation I have ever been in. Granted, it is fairly cheap and so I expected a small room which is fine but it was just appalling. Housekeeping was terrible, when we arrived the bed looked like someone had previously slept in it and their version of making the bed was folding the duvet in half? Also the toilet leaked a little which meant they left a soaking wet toilet wrapping around the bottom of the toilet. The first day they came in and folder the duvet and decided they had the right to touch our things and then half way through the week they decided that they were not going to clean our room anymore so we had no toilet paper or towels and the floors were filthy, I got up to go to the bathroom and when I",1,1
"Arrived to be told there was a problem with our room and we'd been relocated to a beautiful 5* £200 a night hotel instead. This had happened to us and another couple. Despite our reservations we reluctantly agreed as we had tickets for a show and needed a place to stay. New hotel which was miles away from where we wanted to be and was definitely NOT 5*!! Not even up to Travel Lodge standards. Very dodgy, we could ONLY pay by cash which was very unusual. Lesson learned - if something is too good to be true it usually is! Did not appreciate being lied to by staff!",1,1
stayed in room 302 for 5 nights 17 february. paid for private room two single beds and private bathroom. upon arrival at check in time we were greeted by man on reception with no hello just wait till he was finished eating. when we went back to room that evening we complained of no hot water or heating and requested extra pillows. next morning i asked again the housekeeper and again that evening the receptionist the same thing. who sent a man up at 10 at night to check heating who screamed at us why didnt we ask in the morning which we did. third night still no hot water had to use shared showers even though paid for private bathroom. eventually received extra  and tiny heater. have been complaining to hostel since we came back received only phone call today 11 march by manager,1,1
"We stayed for 5 nights, upon arrival myself and my friend got told to wait because he was eating we weren't greeted upon arrival, the room was beside a building site very noisy, we had our own private bathroom and shower we had to go back and forward to the communal bathroom to get toilet roll because they wouldn't put some in our room, the water from the private shower was freezing cold we could not take a shower had to go to the communal shower, there was no pots pans to make food, it took 3 days to get an extra pillow and took 3 days before they came to look at the radiator because the room was so cold, we then got a tiny heater sent up to us on our 3rd day stay the staff are rude and ignorant, the fire doors where left open all night by people smoking it was very annoying",1,1
"We spent two nights (Friday and Saturday) in a double room with a private bathroom. Pros: Great location, close to the tube station and nice quiet neighbourhood. Reasonably clean room and bathroom. Cons: We stayed on the bottom floor which was extremely noisy all night. Every ten minutes we could hear people loudly moving around in the corridor outside. Our room was close to the elevator, which pings every time the door opens. The first night we didn't sleep at all. The staff were quite rude and unfriendly. The shower didn´t work properly and just had a weak dripping of water. The room was very small, basic and cold feeling. The communal areas were not appealing to spend time in.  Although the price is reasonable for London, if you want to get a good sleep then do not stay here.",2,1
"The staff wasn't nice, they do not have free wifi, the kitchen don't have pans, bowls, these kind of kit-stuff. the shower is bad. The 5 days that I was there I did not see, at least once, the cleaner go to my room. This one was the worst hostel that I have been.",1,1
"How can you make 80 pounds a night with a 15 m2 room? These guys found the answer: stuff four people inside. Jokes aside: The room is very basic, kind of cold, there's very little place for luggage and absolutely no security (no lockers, no keys, ...), The staff is of very little use. They seem to have forgotten how to smile and will gladly provide misleading information. There was a construction site by the building and it will probably continue all year (they don't work at night fortunately)  The elevator did not work and I was assigned a room on fourth floor. On the plus side: check-in is quick and the room is reasonably clean. Location isn't bad. Just go for it if you need one night without fuss, avoid this shared rooms for long periods. It would also work for you if you are",2,1
"I stayed in this hostel with a friend in a private room for a week and a half in late October/early December. The room was like a box, absolutely no room for storage, it's also about 100 degrees in the room and the heating can't be adjusted. The bathroom is atrocious, you have to push a button every 20 seconds for water to drip out of the shower. Location is handy for a lot of things, which I dare say keeps this place in business. The staff were quite miserable, wouldn't let us split the room bill. No wi-fi either unless you pay a fortune for it. As it's London, unfortunately you have to pay a lot of money to get accommodation that's in the 21st century, I'd highly recommend doing just that to avoid a place like this.",2,1
"Toilets wouldn't flush, staff wasn't very friendly and the toilets and showers were always dirty - even after just having been cleaned. No free wi-fi either.  Good location but no elevator so very many steps.",2,1
"We chose this hostel due to the good ratings it had on this website, but we really don't understand why it has these good reviews. The employees are unfriendly, they constantly look like they don't want to be there. They never say a word to you and always have a mean look on their face. When I asked them about the wifi they didn't say a word, they just pointed at the sign in the lobby, whilst making a deep dark grumble noise. The wifi isn't free btw, which I think it should in a hostel filled with young people. All hostels I have been before (about 7 in this year) did have free wifi.  Besides this, there are plenty of kitchens, which is very nice, however you need to bring your own pots and pans and spatulas etc if you actually want to cook anything. This is very weird to me and",2,1
"They don't accept credit cards! They didn't want to change our (wet) towels...Shower was unconfortable, about every 15 seconds you should press the button to activate water. Even tought the instalations are modern, I wouldn't come back.",2,1
"I walked to this hostel, my suitcase dragging behind me, with a sense of dread and a significant lack of enthusiasm after reading the reviews online. ""It can't be as bad as they say"" I thought to myself as I entered the complex and I was correct, it wasn't THAT bad but it could have been so much better.  First things first, you wouldn't stay at this hostel if you were travelling to London and were only in town for a few days looking to meet other travelers because there is a 0% chance of that happening here. I have seen more atmosphere at a funeral. I was only here because I needed a place to sleep for two nights.  So the staff are awful but seeing as I only wished to confront them twice (once to check in and once to check out) I didn't really mind. They certainly didn't seem to",2,1
"We checked in here about 1.30pm (check in is 1pm) had a shower and were getting ready to go out about 3pm.. There was a knock at the door which was immediately opened about half a second after the knock, i lunged at the door and slammed it shut as (to put it nicely) my girlfriend and i were not appropriately dressed.. I yelled through the door ""just a second"" the person on the other side of the door tried to open it again i pushed it shut and yelled (which everybody on the third floor would have heard) that i was completely naked and to wait for me to put pants on, this didnt stop the halfwit who began wrestling with me and the door, i eventually slammed the door shut and yelled at her to go the f##k away, which she finally did.. I threw some undies on and stormed out to",1,1
Great location and reasonable prices. However the building site next door starts at 8 am !! Also the doors in the dorms slam and the corridors echo. Staff are European so not that helpful and there are no locker facilities.,1,1
"The staff at this hostel are unbelievable unfriendly. The value of money to them is more important than friendship and politeness. We booked a room but ended up in shared room with 4 beds, my wife & I",1,1
"I am a student who is crushing in London for few nights. My first experience just by crossing the door was just insane a big glass for the resection and that felt really terrifying.The other point is the staff is rude and not helping, they don't even look at you and talk to you really badly. Working site next too it. the noise is unbearable, and sometimes the driller out side gives you the impression of an earthquake. Bathroomand rooms unclean.",1,1
This hostel has pro's and cons. The pro's are booking in and early check in is very straight forward. It was also the perfect location for where I needed to be in west London and 25min tube into the centre. The price is also very reasonable.  The cons are it is not clean. When they do 'clean' it is between 7-8 in the morning when most people are trying to use the facilities. It looked like under my bed and the fridge in my room hadn't been touched for weeks. The water runs lookwarm in all the taps and shower area's - not ideal for brushing your teeth or wanting a hot shower. The female showers were then out of use for the last two nights of my stay with no clear signage to another one. And lastly there is no hooks in the shower area in or outside the cubicles for you to hang,2,1
"Receptionist was so rude and unpleasant when we came to this hostel. Didnt greet us and did not smile even once. When i asked about the wi-fi (we thought it was free) he sort of laughed and asked : ""Where does it say its free??"" That was the longest sentence we ever got from him.  Wi-fi costs £5/5hrs. We stayed in the third floor, no lift. Room was small and we didnt have our own toilet or shower. The second day we were there I was terribly sick and had to stay in bed all day and the cleaning lady just stormed in our room without even knocking and said ""I need to change sheets - I need to change sheets""- my boyfriend had to raise his voice to get her to leave. After that the cleaning staff didnt come to our room until the very last evening and we stayed there for five nights.",1,1
"Bed bugs, bed bugs, bed bugs and even more bed bugs. Plus: the receptionists were the least friendly I have ever met. Furthermore, the cleaners kept on sweeping the hallway leaving the room with pigeons' faeces on the window's handler and dirty stains on the walls. Just awful.",1,1
Its nice and cheap for a hostel in london. Close to heathrow And city centre. Beds were terrible to sleep on. But if you are on a budget it is a good place to consider. You get what you pay for. Remember to bring your own pans.,2,1
"After we checked in at the reception (wich is behind bulletproof glass) we discovered that we were given a double room instead of the booked twin room. To quickly sum up our ""experience"":  - mould fungus in the bathroom all over (see photos attached) - badly soundproofed rooms - furniture in poor condition  After the first night we decided to escape from this place. The reaction to our complaints was not very understanding. After long discussions with the staff and eventually the manager who got almost aggressive we ended up paying for two nights even though we spent only one. The online booking platform we also complaint to was not helping at all (""It was your decision to stay there"").   If you want a pleasant stay, don't stay there.",1,1
"This hostel was cheap, and it’s located near a tube station. So it feels central, even though it is in the outskirts of central London. The room was clean during our stay but the comfort was very low, we had read on trip advisor that some visitors did not find the rooms clean at all, but other than some dirty corners, the room was clean enough. The rooms are really cramped, and the beds are horrible, they were constructed of two mismatched boxes with a mattress on top of it, so we had to sleep in at a slant. I would not recommend this hostel for a longer stay, but if you need to stay 1 or 2 nights in London it is survivable.",2,1
"I was in this hostel for one week. I had my personal big bath towel and one of the staff took it from my room. I asked for it back and they just told me it was impossible to find. I asked every day and the receptionist were not helpful at all. They didn't want to refund me, they didn't buy a new one for me. I wanted to speak to the manager but at the appointment he was not present.  To make me shut up they asked for my contact details, saying they were going to phone call me. I never received a phone call. They ask for your money the first day you go there, and later they don't mind about you. Respect for people is completely missing. Never back again.",1,1
"The main and only thing to consider if you come to this place is the price . My room was not ready , it was barely clean in the hostel , the place is noisy with construction near by and slaming doors .On the top of this : no elevator , you have to pay for the wifi (and it's not cheap) and the staff is not friendly at all .Saying that , staying close to hammersmith station is very convenient  .Honestly , for my next trip to London I'd rather put more money for the hostel than come back to this place , even for free because the staff was so rude !",1,1
"Whilst the room was ok, clean enough and with mini fridge and cupboard, this was not a nice place to stay due to nightly noise. Obviously you expect some amount of noise in such a large place but doors here do not shut quietly and due to the tiled floors and lack of insulation the whole floor seems to reverberate each time a door slams shut, and that was a frequent occurrence. Earplugs dull the noise slightly but our lack of sleep here was maddening. Put something on the doors! Also, the shared bathroom facilities are quite nice but the showers are bizarre with a push button that lasts only 18 seconds- barely long enough to soap up and no shelf for clothes. Wifi also expensive for a place this size. I won't be back.",2,1
"The place was nice and clean throughout, I'll give it that. But the rudeness of the staff was disgusting and they didn't give us the room we booked on the first night. Then we had 3 other nights booked and wanted to cancel the last one because our flight was moved. The staff member at the desk said that he couldn't charge for only two nights because he didn't have the information! He said we had to pay it and could get a refund in the morning. To which I replied that we would like a receipt to prove this. He said he couldn't issue one because he wasn't the manager and kept arguing and refusing to give us the keys. The next morning we asked again and they said that we should have emailed them in advance to cancel it. It states nowhere on the cancellation policy that this is the",1,1
"room was clean.  good start.  price is reasonable, i'm guessing, for london. went to a specific(there's also coed) men's room and it didn't look very clean to me so i used the coed bathroom which was a bit better. the hostel residents weren't noisy, but there's construction right next door...not a problem at night, but check out time is 11am...so if you want to sleep in it may be a problem then... no elevator(at least none that i noticed).  if you're older and have spent a day walking, it's nice not to have to walk up 3 or 4 flights of stairs...i'm not in that category but i know there ARE people this might be a consideration for... VERY close to hammersmith station, which i thought was extremely convenient... AND lots of decent eateries within fairly easy walking",2,1
"Booked room online through visa , arrived from Glasgow late on around 11.30pm was told to pay again , which i refused to do ,after alerting the reception (staff) i only had fare back to Glasgow next day , I was told I would not get access to room , I asked if we could sort things out in morning and was told no. They already had card details so could take payment at any time . I asked them to contact police  which they did ...only...police came and saw in my favour  . Hostel STILL would not accomodate me , leaving me to walk the streets until 4am when train station opened where I returned to Stansted Airport awiting return flight home at 12.45 pm next day.....!!!!!!!! Worst place ever ...Check out their reviews before booking...PLENTY of unhappy cusomers",1,1
"We arrived half an hour before check in and thought that we may be able to leave luggage or check in early however we were rudely told to go away and come back in half an hour.   When we returned, the staff were not any more polite, very rude and made it obvious that they did not want to be there. We were given our keys and given vague directions to our room.   Our friend's room was ready, however when me and my partner arrived at our room, it was still being cleaned and we were told to come back later.   When we finally got in our room, it was very basic which is understandable for the price, however it did not feel clean and there was a hole in the floor under the window.   We were disturbed very early in the morning by the cleaning staff as well as banging doors continuously",2,1
"This is the first review I have ever written, and this is because I feel that it would be unfair not to share the bad experience we had. When we checked in the room (on floor 3) looked reasonable. We went out and returned to our room at around midnight. As we turned the light on we saw cockroaches flittering away from it. We approached staff at reception who at first tried to say that we were liars, and that there were no cockroaches. We asked them to come up and showed them one that was still hiding in a corner. They then informed us that the hotel was fully booked and that we couldn't change rooms. They sprayed the cockroach with a poison spray thing and left it in our room to slowly die. We weren't happy to stay in the room but we didn't have choice as we had nowhere else to",1,1
"Staff @ réception were the most unfriendly and disgustin guys I have ever met in a hostel. They were two guys just acting like barking dogs. No smile, whatever i was asking they tryed to charge me extra money.  Example: Internet is 1 pound/hour or 5 pounds,  If you'll ask them for the 1 pound ticket, they'll tell you, they have only the 5 pounds one.  Internet was not working well , but extremly slow. I asked them for a locker to put my stuff, because i was in a dormitory, and it's always safer.  They answered me no lockers otherwise take a private room.....and so on. Very Noisy place even with earplugs especialy slamming doors, and noisy guest",1,1
"booked for 6 nights. the night we checked in the counter staff (guy) was extremely turn-offish. not helpful, not friendly, not welcoming. he just gives off the vibe that he dont want to be there and couldnt give two hoots about who walked in. paid in full (after deposit when booking).  booked a double room ensuite. went in, the room was tiny (that is alright, at least still managed to accomodate 2 luggages). looks clean. floor was oily though. but overall fine.   the problem is, there was absolutely no ventilation at all whatsoever. no air-con, no fan. windows couldnt be opened (we tried). but even then i really dont suggest/recommend anybody to open as it opens up to a back alley where everybody else throws their big black garbage bags at.   so the whole tiny room was extremely",2,1
"The hostel was in a fairly good location because the metro station is about 5 minutes walk from the hostel and it looks new and modern BUT I will not stay in this hostel anymore.   The reasons being:  1. We booked for three beds and were expecting that we could at least share a room together, but was told that it was very full so they had to separate us. That was okay, but when we POLITELY expressed slight dissatisfaction, the staff began to act rudely.   2. As mentioned, my friends and I did not get the same room, so one of my friend was given a key to access to another room, sharing with three other guys. But the key that was given by the rude staff did not work, so we went to talk to that staff. Perhaps he did not like being questioned or he could not handle complaints, he",1,1
"I was there June 2014, and had a lot of troubles: I had a problem with the booking, and the staff (except one) was ridiculously unhelpful in several situations. The room was tidy but there was a strong smell of polish. There was mold in the shower and in my room at the windows. The mattress was saggy. The room was very loud (at least until midnight). I give 2 instead of 1 points, because there are a few ""pro""s: -> The area (Hammersmith) is quite okay (e.g. not dangerous at night) -> There were no real bad things like theft etc. -> I could get a room ~ 1 week before arrival",2,1
The room was tiny and the floor broken..we heard noise all night from the nearest room the employees were rude.no television no free wi fi .the transport was 5 minutes away and the bathroom was new these 2 thinks were good in these hostel.we wont go again.and too expensive for the things they offer.,2,1
"Did not enjoy my stay there. The good aspects are: it is 2 Blocks away from metro/bus station - but 40 min away from the center of london by bus. And they have towels. But the doors make too much noise, there are too many people there,huge place. Cleaning people start cleaning it at like 7 am and make too much noise while cleaning - they talk loud and really dont care if they will wake you up. Staff not friendly. Bathrooms not clean and not practical. They charge for wifi - 1euro per hour - and charge for the use of computers!",2,1
"dirty toilets and washing rooms, toilets for two days out of order, broken floor in the room,no attidude of helping us, the location is nearby to public transport- 5 Minutes walking, quite big and always well booked, so there are always people comming and leaving",2,1
They don't know how to speak with the customer. Always they have to argue. under the beds  and behind fridge is a total mess. On the service day they don't make with vacuum and never clean the showers. It was a bed exerience,1,1
"The Hostel is clean and near to great stores, restaurants and the bus station and underground Hammersmith, just 2 minutes walking. Bathrooms are very clean we have a lot of options in every floor. The walls are thin, so if nosy bothers you, rethink your choice. We order a double room and they gave us a twin. We were tired to make the change. The first days everything was ok, but by the 4th day we found a bed bug. I don't have to say that we couldn't sleep well anymore thinking about the bugs. We told the staff what happened and he seems to blame us, telling that the bug could be our fault. He advised us to wash all of our clothes and then go to another room, what didn't happened. We prefer to stay there and we found other bugs, 5 to be precisely. I won't stay there again.",2,1
"Booked a room here for 1 night as part of my boyfriends birthday present & to go to a concert at Hammersmith Appollo nearby, having stayed here before. We were told upon arrival by a very rude & arrogant receptionist that due to a problem our room was no longer available; I had recieved no email or telephone call to inform me of this! He said a room had been booked for us instead somewhere in Earls Court, I explained that we didn't want to stay there as we were going to the Appollo but was told it was that or nothing, we did not like the attitude of the man at reception; he offered no apology and treated our being there and questioning why we weren't contacted prior to arrival as an inconveniance while his collegue kept shoving the credit card machine at us to pay.  We decided",1,1
"I stayed at this hostel for 5 days. My friend and I arrived at the hostel at night. The workers were quite unfriendly and didn't make us feel welcome at all. The hallways were dark and sketchy and seemed dark and luminous to walk through at night. The showers were so bad. Firstly, the water stayed on for 5 seconds before it automatically turned off. Secondly, you couldn't set the temperature for the water so pretty much took cold showers. Thirdly, there was no hooks place to put your clean clothes in the shower so you had to either put everything on the ground or drape them over the shower door. So the room itself was okay; however, the hostel was super loud because every little noise made in the hallway would echo. I've stayed at a different on a previous trip to London for",1,1

They have microwave and brand new stoves (I'm not impressed, given that they do not provide anything nobody uses them). If you are planning to hang out with other people or cook a nice dinner/lunch/breakfast/whatever, run away from this place. Internet is also expensive. Finally the blankets were covered with hair, disgusting as hell.",2,1

My friend and I had to get a room here last minute when our other accomadations fell through. It's cash only. We got a room with two single beds and a mini fridge. We are two young women and felt really uncomfortable walking though the dark building at night. There were men staring at us from one of the fire exits. We heard someone say hello to us from a dark hallway but couldn't see them and ran away. It creeped us out. The building didn't feel safe. We pushed the mini fridge up against the door before we went to sleep and wouldnt go to the bathroom alone. We tried to use kitchens on two different floors. Both were dark when we walked in and as we turned on the lights we saw cockroaches scurry away. The unisex bathroom on our floor had 3 stalls and none had toilet paper. The,2,1
"These soul-less white boxed rooms with very poor beds and a bad smell om super-strong detergents was an experience I could have managed withouth. THere was never any toilet paper, and the water pressure in the showers was so bad you had to squeeze up against the wall to get a little bit of water on you.  The place was very noisy, it had lots of swing-doors which would open and loudly shut throughout the night. There was no elevator. The fire escape stairs were open to the street outside, and people were constantly using these for going in/out, smoking etc. The receptionist never smiled, and were just not friendly or helpful at all. They accepted cash only, and gave a useless receipt - which makes the whole thing seem very dubious. I don't wish to contribute to whatever fishy",1,1

Upon arrival there were 2 people at the front desk behind a glass/plastic pane which raised a few red flags and I had to wait about 5 minutes as they finished counting cash. You must pay in cash upon check-in. A bit sketchy if you ask me.   After a 5 pound key deposit we were off to our private double room with bathroom which was actually pretty nice and clean. All furniture is IKEA quality and the design in regards to lighting, placement is just awful. The shower did not have any racks or anything to place soap or shampoo and there were no towel racks to be had (although it was nice that towels were provided). We did have our own bathroom but it",2,1

Our room was clean, bed was comfortable, and comforter kept us warm. Our room also had our own fridge that didn’t smell, that was a plus. The bathroom had enough space to shower but not enough counter space for the bathroom sink. I understand the choice of flooring material they used but it didn’t feel that great on the feet.

Room was clean, but very, very basic! 2 towels, bed was hard and paper thin pillows.  I would not recommend this hostel!!",1,1
"I personally viewed the hostel before booking. It is a short walk from the Hammersmith station. I was taken by elevator to the room (4 bunk in a room).  The room was clean, had a mini frig.  There was a closet for clothes, but it was a large one and did not have a locking system (if this room was shared with others not in your party).  The facility was clean as they are remodeling.  The room had large tiled floors.  The kitchen was small and clean, however, there was not any items to use (pots, pans, etc).  There was a microwave.  In the room, there was a p setting of 4 plate, cup, utensils, and 4 rolls of toilet tissue.  A towel was provided for the length of your stay and sheets for the bed as well.  Then we arrived for our stay with some changes.  Upon asking, the staff did",2,1

I've never heard such loud noises in my life. We were hoping to sleep in until check in as we had a long 15 travel trip head of us (definitely not possible with the horrendous noises). Maybe low season would be a better time for renovations? Or at least during the day when people aren't around?!  The stairwell or fire escape was left open all hours, so anyone could enter the hostel/hotel at their leisure (which I'm pretty sure was happening as there were homeless looking people wandering our floor in the late evening), it felt so unsafe. I suspect people were staying long term, as the kitchen",2,1

We booked because of an internet special advertising 3 people in a 4 person room, but when we got there were put in separate rooms. Staff were rude and not apologetic. There was no toilet paper, and we were told to 'request it' at reception. When has it ever been optional?! We had to pay for internet and after doing so it didn't work. Staff were unhelpful and simply told us 'it works'. Showers were cold, there was water all over the bathroom floors and there was nowhere to put your clothes. Rooms were cramped, and there was someone living in ours. Ridiculous for the amount of money we paid. I wouldn't go back. And definitely wouldn't recommend it.",2,1
"Our twin room did not match photos on Travelstay website. We had to pay for both nights on arrival - should have asked to see the room first, but unfortunately I didn't! Our room was on the top floor and there is no lift - had to carry a heavy suitcase up and hurt my back in the process! The stairs looked really shabby. Part of the hotel has been renovated but not the floor where we stayed. The corridor was very dirty and shabby. The door at the end of our corridor led to the fire escape and was left open all night - and we felt really unsafe!  Our very small room was unbearably hot and staff refused to turn central heating down. When I wanted to get into my bed, there was hair on my sheet. As I lifted the sheet, I found two other sheets underneath that one - both had hair on",1,1

I now have more than 60 bites all over my body, partner only around 15. Spent New Years afternoon unpacking in the bathroom at home and putting all clothes in plastic bag on the balcony to we washed the next day. Took a lot of time and bites still itch a lot!!

"In short lines:  Just got back from this hotel. Whole building is old. Rooms are smelly, dirty and there are a lot of cockroaches in room and in toilets (didn't have the courage to use the kitchen). I am not demanding but conditions that this hostel provides to guests are really unbearable to live with. I was lucky too book this hostel just for one night. Avoid!!!!",1,1
It is cheap and nasty. I got bitten by bed bugs.The staff and manager are unhelpful. If you are unlucky enough to get a room above the 1st floor the kitchen and bathroom are not kept clean. Some kitchens have toasters and microwaves but the one near our room did not. There are cockroaches in the kitchen and the toilets smell like urine. It is noisy with doors slamming all night so is difficult to get a good night sleep. It is cheap and has good transport connections but it is just not worth it.,1,1
"I stayed there for 2 weeks because I didn't have more money.  But it was kind of scary, our room was next to a room where a man with mental problems lives. The guy didn't clean the room and it was full of cockroaches.  The staff is dodgy and kind of rude.  The kitchen and bathrooms where all right.  I would recommend stay away from there if you can afford something better, the hostel is in a very good location and very convenient to get to know london but is crap.",1,1
"Clean and cheap. Not much interesting in hammersmith, i think, but the underground is quite nearby. Plus if you are flying through Heathrow the piccadilly line makes it quite easy to get to the hostel.  My only sincere annoyance wad that there was no soap at the toilets. When so many people share, i find that problematic. There was soap in the rooms but no handwash there. So you do the math.  If you want to save money, though, the place is overall okay.",2,1
"The hostel was rather noisy, so it's not a good choice if your sleep isn't rather deep. Also, the door locks are not very safe so I believe the rooms can be very easily broken into. The room and showers were clean so thumbs up for that!",2,1
Pretty awful. Room was dirty and we found some bugs in the room - possibly (but we hope not!) cochroaches. Door had been kicked down a lot so didnt seem very secure. One positive was that the toilets were clean.,1,1
"I was in London for few days and decided to find a accomodation on the go... Bad mistake! The house is dirty (mices in the kitchens, walls with stange traces of every kind of splits, the toilets are jail like....). and the personnel/administrative staff are rude and unpolite, very unpleasure place to stay even for a single night!. Just crap!",1,1

"Paid advance for 2 weeks and stayed only for 4 days and they do not refund the GBP 140 for 2 weeks.  Most disgusting hostel where unknown pros/girls just drop into your room knocking doors and ask for the night to be spent with you, most scaring -maybe girls with aids, etc.",1,1
"I stayed there for 3 months and it was Cheep and that is what most travelers look for when Traveling but it was Dirty and the Beds where full of bed Lise and the showers allways had Vomit in them and the showers where Gross we stayed there just to sleep and we where hardly there most of the time,There are Loads of Elegals there or it seems because whenever the Cops would Pitch up they would all run like Rats,There are also thieves living and i guess working there because 2 of our Laptops whent missing clothes and Phones so we had quite a [--] experiance and will not be returning there pretty soon.",1,1
"i have stayed 4 months in the year 2000 this toilet dump, but it was cheap, that's why i stayed there. I have been told now is a bit better but when i stayed there was no heating, no hot water and toilets were nightmarish.. it was like living in an horror movie. good luck if u wanna stay there",1,1
"I stayed at that hostel for almost two years. I have to say that the staff were wonderful and were always willing to help, however the majority of them were not fluent in English which might have led to other people perceiving as being rude. Yes the showers, kitchens were dirty most of the time but this was mostly due to the residents' untidiness than to the hostel owners.The place was always serviced daily. I found it to be a great place to meet and make everlasting frienships",2,1
"I hate to say it, but I have been in worse.  The Abercorn is a bit of a dump.  However, and this is important.  It is one of the cheapest, if not the cheapest hostel in London, when booking for more than a week.  Yes, some of the other visitors smoke in the corridors. Yes, toilets can be dirty, but when I get up at 6am to go to work, everything has been disinfected and cleaned.  At the end of the day, it is cheap and convienently located.  If you want expensive, go somewhere else.",2,1
"I dont think this place is to bad. I mean, it's cheap- what do you expect!  Most of the people are friendly and I find the staff try to help out where they can.  It's cheap and in a great location.  Like most hostels, you need your own cutlery, cooking utensils etc They have internet, massive tv in tv room (although not enough seating), laundry (although a bit pricey)  Only problem I have encountered is trying to change rooms and bedbugs in previous room, although if you tell them they spray your room and things and if it persists, will move you to another room.  Some of the toilets are dirty- but i put that down to dirty people living there, not the staff. I have noticed they clean the bathrooms, floors and toilets every day and your room is hoovered and sheets changed weekly.",2,1
"If there was a less than one review i would give it to them! The place is a dump! There are NO clean toilets NO clean showers trust me i looked on all the floors for this. The staff there were terrible they don't give a flying [--] of any situation or help you might need. When you talk to them you can sense a wave of dislike. They look at you as if your a piece of [--]! I felt like i was in the hood while staying there. Refunds are non negotiable, i was forced to stay at this place for a whole week and I'm telling you if you go there you will either get sick like i did or you'll have something stolen from you. There are no lockers to lock valuables up in. The whole place has this smell to it...  aah forget it you go there its wonderful! best time i ever had...lol",1,1
"The place and the atmosphere among the travelers is quite ok, actually, and I found most staff nice. However, I will never ever go back there! The reason is that they decided to move me to another room without any notice at all (it was late so I had almost gone to bed already!). I protested that I had agreed to stay in that particular room, and therefore I felt I had the right to stay in that room till the end of the week I had paid for (they ""kindly"" showed me the room before I agreed to stay there but in the end that was completely useless because they threw me out of that room anyway). I was then told that I had no rights in that hostel, and I had to move right there and then. Well, at least I have the right to tell you guys that there are no rights there in that hostel.",2,1
Please - just don't. The place is atrocious - I couldn't sit down anywhere for fear of disease! Would rather lick a pigeon than stay here!,1,1
"the positives: for so much sharing of restrooms and showers it’s clean.  The rooms are tiny but also clean.  Josephine at the front desk is so lovely and helpful.  She was one of the few friendly people there.    The negatives: Noah who is a manager and also works in the cafe is incredibly rude and unfriendly.  He gives off a really bad attitude -I would recommend staying away from him unless you want to be treated like sh—t.    Personally I will never stay in a hotel like this again, basically a glorified hostel.  I cannot stand sharing showers with random men.  I would go in to use the shower and there’s an old man in a robe.  Very awkward and uncomfortable.    Granted it’s cheap for the location but again I will never make this mistake ever again to save a few bucks.",2,1
"Restaurant closed, rooftop private, ballroom private, no bikes, no padding on mattress- bedsprings are felt all night, no control of heat, hear everybody in hall,  SO tiny: if you are the slightest claustrophobic you should think twice.",2,1
"Because of what their website declared, we happily stayed at The Jane Hotel the weekend of September 25th, 2021. It seemed funky, fun, very affordable, great location, had a rooftop bar/lounge over looking the river and a restaurant with great reviews which we thought would be convenient for  pre-theater apps and cocktails. Yes, the rooms with bunk beds are small but we didn't plan on spending much time in there. They were very clean as was the community bathrooms and entire hotel. However, upon arrival  we were told the rooftop lounge was only available & rented for special events and having  nothing to do with Covid, the restaurant had also been closed. You could order room service from a neighboring restaurant but wait time was one hour. The Ballroom which was presented on",2,1

I am currently living outside of the city, but still have occasional business to attend to as I attempt to revive my business, a covid casualty.  on Thursday night, I booked a room at the Jane to cap off one extremely exhausting day and in preparation for a second which promised to be the same.  when we arrived, the desk clerk told us occupancy was low, so he upgraded us from a bunk room to a twin room.  when we arrived at the room, the lights didn't work, so we called down to ask what we were",1,1
"I stayed here, was assaulted by a member of staff I complained and was completely ignored. I hope this place closes. Everyone was extremely rude, I never received a follow up. Stay somewhere else, they only care about people who will buy their tables at the club downstairs",1,1
"Stayed here multiple times over years.  Most recent departure was as covid ramped up. Had just extended reservation from a long stay. Well known to management. They called me down to recheck in but when I got to lobby manager admitted tricking me to get me out of room: ""actually we're closing down and didn't want to tell you that while you were in room.""  Ah, because they thought I was going to squat/refuse to leave? Nice.  Unfortunately we'd made mistake of overlooking an extremely disturbing event a few weeks prior. It involved local known drug dealers hacking our phone from the next room (apparently for hours)--deleting/adding files and video recording screen of our phone. This was not a random crime.   Wouldn't you know it? The staff when asked said there were no registered",1,1

"My husband and I spent two nights here. We didn't mind the tiny bunk-bed room (we understood what we were booking) or the shared bathrooms (though there aren't quite enough stalls for all the rooms on our floor). Those we expected. But I strongly recommend against staying here in the winter, because the heating system is so overpowering that you have to run the air conditioner all night just too keep from suffocating and there's nothing the staff can do to fix it (we called down and asked). And, the wifi almost never worked during our stay and was made even more difficult by not being able to get good cell phone reception anywhere in the hotel. With a better HVAC system and reliable wifi, I think this hotel would be quite charming (and it is a good location, though a long walk",2,1
"I am currently staying at the Jane, and it is terrifying. Last night around 2 AM when a whole bunch of people were banging the doors around me I put my head out into the hall and asked someone speaking loudly next to my room to keep it down, He tried to strong arm into my room. Throughout the night, you will hear nonstop banging of doors and you will have terrible sleep. Men will harass you  and since the bathrooms are shared, you will receive unwanted advances when coming to and from showers. I’m a seasoned traveler and this is the most harassment I’ve ever received in a hotel. Can’t believe i have another night to suffer through",1,1
"This place is a complete dump. Horribly rude and lazy staff. Honestly, the only thing worse then the actual hotel is their nightclub. It’s a real shame because I will never return and I will make sure none of my friends/family does either.",1,1
"As much as I wanted to like ""The Jane"" I can't. Although the history behind it is interesting and although the double rooms come with en-suite, it is just not enough. When we first went to our room, a huge pile of bin liners full with garbage awaited us as we made our way from the lift to the room. The smell indicated that although it is a non smoking hotel and has smoke detectors, smoking indoors is still a habit with some of the guests. The room itself was what we expected it to be in size and decoration, but... The amount of dust everywhere was amazing. The glasses above the minibar had such a thick layer of dust, that i doubt anyone has ever used them since they were put there. The smell in the room was an odd mixture and not very pleasant, but better than the one in the",2,1
"First, let me say the rate for the West Village is reasonable. However, I had booked this for an early fall trip to the city.  The one feature that made me select this hotel was the rooftop bar with the view.  Unfortunately, upon arrival I was greeted with scaffolding at the front entrance and was told the rooftop bar would not be open until Thurs & Friday.  I had arrived on a Wed.  OK, so that's fine.  I even told the front desk that if we experienced some noise from our captains cabin, it would be no problem.  On Thursday, I was told it was closed for a private event and Friday I was told it was closed for the season.  There is no mention of this on their website.  So no rooftop view for me.  On the other hand, the accomodations were very satisfactory for the most part.  The",2,1
"So I expected the small rooms, shared bathrooms, etc. I'm someone who feels quite comfortable in hostels, so this doesn't phase me.   What I didn't expect was that some of the shower/toilet doors wouldn't close or lock, or that the night I arrived there's be toilet paper, towels and water all over both of the bathrooms on my floor; it was so messy that I didn't feel comfortable putting my toothbrush or toothpaste next to the sink. The blanket on my bed had holes, the showers and lobby smelled like mildew. The hallways were quite hot and humid. And the doors were slamming all night. Some of my neighbors were living there/walking around in underwear.   I think with a bit more effort this place could be great. Current state though: not so much.",2,1
Called in at this place for a drink. Told by the door man that we could use the bar in the restaurant and the roof top bar would be open in a while. The lady that served us was quite rude.It was as though she was doing  us a favour by letting us spend money there.Maybe the management should give the staff a lesson in customer communication skills.We had a couple of drinks despite the noise from the drilling.The hotel was covered in scaffolding so they were obviously having work carried out. We then went up to the roof top bar area.Served by a guy that appeared not to want to be there.The seating area was dirty on the roof patio but you got a good view of New Jersey and the Scaffolding-hoist That was attached to the building. A shame the attitude of the staff was so poor else we,2,1
"We went to the Jane on the 4th for some drinks. We were told to wait in line which was odd because there was no line and the place did not seem overly busy ( usually you can hear the music and the crowd from the st). We waited for about 10 minutes while the bouncer and his friend (possibly another bouncer) casually chatted.   After about ten minutes they looked at us surprisingly and asked “can we help you,” as if they had just noticed us. When we said we would like to come in, they informed us that to get in tonight you had to be on a “reserve list”  As patrons who frequent the bar and hotel regularly, we called management and asked if reservations were needed and he informed us none were needed and anyone could walk in. We explained to him what had happened and the manager",1,1
I picked the hotel due to its location and cute cabin style rooms- I didn’t expect a huge room as it’s advertised and pictured as a rather small accommodation (if you reserve single cabin). I arrived fairly early in morning and was told there was no room available to check in. Fair enough. I went for breakfast and came back. I sat in lobby and saw multiple people checking out however no room seemed to become clean for me to check in. Hours passed by and suddenly the lobby got flooded by a leak originating from the lobby bathroom. At this point I got up again asking for an update on my room. As I came of red eye flight I was super exhausted and therefore suggested to change the bedding myself to be able to check in. The rooms are super small and to get it turned around 10 mins is,1,1
"The staff at the Jane Hotel was unfriendly and barely agreed to provide me with a copy of a document on which I was required to sign and included my credit card information. The one and only elevator is very slow. The room is extremely tiny at the size of a shocking dungeon. In order to get to the window I had to step on my luggage, and it's a tremendous chutzpah to demand $114 per night including taxes for such an awful, unbearable ""room."" The shower had only lukewarm water in a thin stream. The check-out clerk did not even have a cash surplus, and he tried to oblige me to pay with the credit card. It was a terrible experience for me, unbearable, and I would never ever again set my foot at the Jane Hotel! I recommended to all my friends to stay away from this ""hotel""!!!",1,1
"If I could give negative stars I would.   This hotel is so condescending, sexist, and has some of the rudest staff I have ever encountered. After waiting 45 minutes in line, me and my 2 friends were allowed inside. Upon going in, we paused to call our friends who were already inside so we could go to the right place. We were asked for our ids to go in and said we just needed a minute. After we confirmed that they were in the ballroom, we step over to get into line and suddenly someone else comes over and asks us if we have a reservation. We said we did not but we were just let in, and they began forcing us to leave. As they are yelling at us, extremely hostile, another group walks past us and is allowed in. The man said “some people have reservations and some don’t who get in.”",1,1
"Private wedding party..... if you are considering this venue, GET A CONTRACT or find another place. This place is sketchy at best unless you prefer to be treated like cattle.

Buyer beware!",1,1
"I was not able to sleep a tall during my stay at the Jane hotel. There is a huge heater in the tiny room, which turns the room into a sauna. Even opening the tiny window and putting the (incredibly noisy( AC on full power could not counteract the heat.   Cons:  Shared, mixed gender bathrooms Not enough showers, they are always occupied Cold showers  Pros:  Unique, cosy decor Staff is friendly and tries to help, but can only do so much",1,1
"Came here to go to the bar and have a good time, but that was ruined by incredibly disrespectful door staff. They told us to wait in line and then when we got to the front they say ""no."" If you try to ask them why they won't let you in, they refuse to answer. ""It's just a no, now leave!"" I tried to ask them if they had an event going on or some other valid reason for turning people away. Neither. One guy then tried to tell me that they were at capacity. I then asked if some people left the bar, would we then be able to get in? He then said ""no."" Makes absolutely no sense! Then I saw them let in numerous people behind us. All of the door men are incredible rude, aggressive, and disrespectful for no reason. I have never been to any other establishment that refused to answer",1,1
"Don't be duped by the good location and nice decor. This may be the last hotel in the Village (or NYC) to give guests keys to a room without warning them of the all-night heavy bass music playing from the club downstairs.

Loud pounding music from the “ballroom” bar/club on the 1rst floor can be easily heard several floors away until the wee hours. Someone was smoking in one of the rooms and it stank up the entire dark, narrow and slightly creepy hallway. Standard rooms are tiny (you can stand in the space and easily touch opposite walls). A tall person would have a hard time. Windows are also small and look out onto other windows/rooms so the space can be quite dark and the air doesn’t circulate well unless you turn on a very loud window air conditioning unit. A big drawback is that there is no place to sit and wait for friends or hang out (esp when it’s freezing outside). The",2,1

On Saturday night, we stood outside the hotel for an hour because the doorman wouldn’t let us in. We couldn’t prove we stayed at the hotel because we left the key at the desk and our phones in the room. Not a nice hotel.",1,1

The shared bathroom was also super clean, nothing to say regarding cleaning.   Though after 4 nights, my friend woke up with marks on her arms, and I figured I had also some in my back. We told the manager about it, that we suspected bed bugs - and his reaction was clear enough for us that they were bed bugs. « Well, can be, we will check your room ». So to say, we felt disgusted and super worried that we might have some in our luggage.

When I tried to go back in, the bouncer (apparently named Dionisio- the one with all of the other horrendous reviews) looked my friend and I up and down and just said no and told us to leave. This is outrageous. This man has absolutely no business telling me I wasn't worthy of entering back into his club. I can promise I will go out of my way to make it my life mission to make sure as many people as possible know to never ever waste their time going to this place. To treat someone who paid that amount of money the way to Jane did is unconscionable. Dionisio should be immediately fired and the Jane shut",1,1

I have complained twice and nothing has changed. I'm going to move heaven and earth to get my money back. It's pathetic that thwir excuse is that the room service manager isn't available right now.",1,1
This is an overpriced noisy cramped and worn property. The staff are rude as well. It is in a great location though. We asked for a room change because of an ineffective air conditioner and got a worse room.,2,1
It was my dual birthday celebration with my best friend - we were a group of 8 and they refused to let us in because we weren’t willing to get bottle service (2 bottle min). But any groups of 4 or less were able to get in without any having to do so. 2 more larger groups were declined entry after us. We asked why we couldn’t enter as 2 groups of 4 and the hotel promoter just said yelled “this is my party” and he makes the rules. My friend went down the line warning everyone of this threshold so they could say they were in smaller groups. They then threatened to call the cops because we were standing on the public sidewalk trying to figure out where to go instead. They probably need to rethink their customer service strategy... worst experience I’ve ever had at a Manhattan bar.,1,1
"Worst place I’ve ever been. Tried to go to the bar with a group of 8 and was told that we’d have to buy multiple bottles to get in, despite the fact that they were letting many groups of 2 or 3 into the bar without a drink commitment.

He nevertheless opened my room to let me in, but then I was left without key, meaning that if ever I had to go out of my room during the night (high probability since the bathroom is outside...), I simply couldn't get back !

I will never again stay at The Jane.",2,1
"Bunks are ridiculously small. And this is coming from someone who lives and travels in Europe all the time. There is no space to do anything other than sit on your bed, much less open your suitcase on the floor rather than the bed. Additionally, the heat is building controlled so our first room was so hot we had to open the window and blast the air conditioner while the second room I had to sleep with a sweater and scarf on. I can safely say the charm that Jane is trying to win people over with is not nearly great enough for the discomfort.",1,1
"I know this has little to do with the hotel, but I stayed there in early December and had bed bug bites.  I kind of feel like it may be more difficult to weed them out of this hotel due to the way its setup (tiny tiny rooms, wood bedframes, etc).  They were supposed to refund me one nights stay, but never did. I knew I should have gotten that in writing.  They did cook all my clothes and gave me a new room for my last nights stay however.  This was the 2nd time in NYC that I've been bitten by bed bugs (last time was at a Marriott)  Thankfully this time I knew what they were (last time I had no idea and ended up bringing them back into my house).

There is no room to get out of the tiny bed let alone open the door to get out of your hobbit hole. And the mattress is of such poor quality I still have severe back pain days after checking out (I have never had back pain before so I know this was caused by the bed here).  To add insult to injury due to a ""computer glitch"" my debit card was charged random payments several times during my 2 night stay leaving me out of pocket and financially inconvenienced yet despite reassurances that this money would be refunded immediately to date, some 5 days later, I still haven't received a cent.

It’s great value and the shared bathrooms are clean—the AC works. Here’s the punchline though: Our most recent stay involved a room infested with bed bugs. We saw one in our bed the morning after and as the day progressed my husband’s bug bites appeared with a vengeance. Our New Yorker friends instructed us to return to the hotel and notify them. We did this, despite having checked out. The staff were calm. We told them we wanted the night comped and our clothes and belongings cleaned and they obliged.

"The idea of a microhotel is a good one, but The Jane executes very poorly. I get the sense that whoever designed The Jane never even tried to stay here.  The bathroom situation is a mess. The main bathroom on floor 3 has only 2 stalls and 2 showers; if you're waking up at a normal time, you will have to wait. There are, as it turns out, other bathrooms on floor 3... but it's up to you to discover that, since there's no signage and they're not on the map. Additionally, one morning housekeeping decided to close the entire bathroom for cleaning at 8:30am. Inexplicable; that seems like the peak time for bathroom use. Finally, the bathrooms lack adequate counter/shelf space for toiletries (both at sinks and in the showers).   Also the soundproofing is terrible. You can hear anyone in",1,1
"I always travel alone. That’s why I have to choose relatively cheaper hotel, in this case, Jane Hotel. The room was VERY small and had bad smell in the hallway. I typically don’t mind size. But this one was really made me uncomfortable. And it’s so noisy at night. On top of those issue, I got bed bug bites. My left arm was swollen half of my stay, which was not acceptable. The one star was for friendly staffs. But over all, it was the most hotel experience EVER.",1,1
"Words cannot express how disappointed I was with the Jane. It’s clear that the Jane trades on its quirky vibe, however this is to the detriment of the guests that stay in the hotel. On check in, there was a private party gift bagging stand, making it difficult to actually make your way through drunk partygoers (taking selfies) to actually get to the check in desk. The overpriced rooms are cramped, hot and smell like they need a good airing. If you have a room facing the main road, it’s also quite noisy. The one good thing about the Jane is the bathroom, really nice and well laid out. My main annoyance was that we couldn’t get onto the roof for drinks (every night was closed for a private party) and also when we tried to get into the lobby bar, again there was a private party.

"It's true that the price is good for NYC, but if you make some effort and look for early bird or last minute deals you could find something so much better with only a little bit more. I got a quiet, cleaner, newer room with a private bathroom and subway only a block away with only 18 euros more per night. The Jane claims to be a hotel, but it's just a hostel with fancy staff uniforms. It only good for people who party until 4 am and don't care about the terrible noise coming from the club, and I guess there was a private party in the upper floor too. I was dead tired because I hadn't slept in a night bus, but still couldn't sleep (with ear plugs) because of the noise and heat. The room was terribly hot. It doesn't have A/C, just a fan that really makes it feel authentically like",1,1
While I liked the concept and the staff on site were fantastic these are the only positives . On the 1st night I got 1 or 2 bites and just put them down to a mosquito. But night number 2 something feasted on me . Initially I assumed bed bugs but some of the bits and the groupings are more consistent with flea bits .  I emailed them as the majority only came out properly after I'd checked out and my initial thoughts went to treating it rather than making a complaint and the response was little more than a good luck ........ not really great considering it looks like I've carried some of it home as the biting continued once I got home . So I've now had to deal with it at home to .,2,1
"I have been coming to this charming NYC hotel in a neighborhood I love for many years, sometimes twice a year. I have come alone, with my husband, with my mother, and with friends. Unfortunately, I have noticed that the cleanliness of the hotel and the attentiveness and professionalism of the staff has declined over the years. On this current solo trip, I was able to check in slightly early after a long day of travel and asked the desk attendant for a room near the shared bathroom like I usually do when I travel solo. After spending a few minutes searching for a room, the desk attendant placed me on the 3rd floor in a room which was about as far away from the bathroom as you could get and smelled of foul body odor. Also, the 3rd floor hallway smells like cigarettes. It's really",1,1
"We booked this place 5 months ago.  When we arrived here yesterday afternoon we found that they had missed that we were a family and had placed the kids, 14 and 11, on a different floor from us.   This in itself is not acceptable.  They have promised we will be placed closer together tomorrow night. In the meantime we need to keep our belongings packed so they can move them whilst we are out. This means we can't fully relax.   No compensation or anything offered for the inconvenience.   I am lying here at 3 in the morning, bass pumping up to our 2nd floor room from the nightclub below which it seems will continue for another hour.   The street facing window is broken so we are getting the noise of drunken revellers from outside.  The room next to ours had some drunken guy lying",1,1
"The hotel is very nicely appointed, with charming rooms and a very nice staff for the most part. The problem is that both the downstairs lounge and the rooftop bar were rented out for private parties each of the three nights that I was there with a group of friends. The parties were actually a nightclub venue that was run by an outside vendor. We stayed in four rooms on the second floor. We couldn't get in to either bar and the lobby and sidewalk were packed with people all night. Music blasted until 4:00 am. The hotel manager was not sympathetic at all and although it was not her fault, we felt we had been mislead about the atmosphere. We wanted a nice hotel, not a nightclub, and we couldn't even get in to one of the bars for a drink ourselves.",1,1
"Lovely staff and good cleaning staff BUT the place was old tatty and very dirty!  The roof top bar was a nice touch but also felt tired and run down.  The one lift means quite a wait when coming and going to the hotel.  Thin walls and doors banging.  If the cost of the stay had been slightly less then I probably wouldn't moan. Our stay worked out at €135 per night including tax or about £110.   This does not include breakfast. This is one of the cheapest hotels in this part of new york.   GREAT WIFI 😀 Great location Good for those on budget  If it were cleaner I probably would have given 4 stars. Not the cleaners fault. Just needs new carpets, walls painting etc.",2,1
"What made this hotel appealing was the history behind the building- built in 1907 with great architectural detailing & accommodated the Titanic survivors in 1912, etc. I knew that the hotel rooms were small and I was interested in the design of each room - using a train cabin as inspiration. I feel, however, that the execution of this concept was poor. The rooms were musty, had bad temperature control and didn't appear to be the cleanest. Perhaps they were using colors/patterns typical to what was used and popular in 1907, but I think they could have made these fabrics a bit brighter to add liveliness to the rooms. This historical building also has small windows, so the designer should have kept this in mind when selecting the fabrics, colors and lighting techniques. The",2,1
"To be frank, my husband and I had a completely terrible experience at the Jane, and I would NEVER come back to stay, nor would I recommend it to any of my friends/colleagues. We planned to stay for two nights, but we ended up moving after the 1st night. We even tried to move to another hotel at 2am on our first night, but we couldn't find availability.   Our room (a Captain's Cabin with a private bathroom) was on the 2nd floor directly above the club. We arrived home at midnight, and quickly found that there was no way we'd be sleeping if we stayed put in that room. The music sounded like it was being played inside our room, and our walls and floors were literally vibrating. When my husband first called down about the noise at 1am, the front desk attendant told him that all he",1,1

The problems started with  the heat which we had no control of. The room became super heated  and we had to open our window. A large very noisy,highly intoxicated crowd was gathered out front screaming,fighting and blocking traffic until 4:30 am when a ambulance and the NYPD arrived to calm things down.this was the spillover crowd from the Jane bar.",1,1

"Very intriguing place, considering its very unique architecture & design, as well as its history.    Loved the neighborhood - meat packing district at the base of the High Line.  Close to  good food, cute neighborhoods to walk through, fun intellectual and physical activities of various kinds.  Felt like a safe neighborhood.    I recommend a captain's room, based on what I have heard from other guests.  Don't stay here if you suffer from claustrophobia.  The living spaces are really small and cramped.    We stayed in one of the tiny bunk rooms.  WAAAAYYYYY too hot w/o any way to control it, only one tiny window opening to a courtyard whose design allowed almost zero air movement, and A/C could not keep up.  Never able to bring the room below 79F.    Shared bath was just fine.",2,1
"Our heat was not working all night, and our windows were literally duck-tapped shut (have photos), resulting in a constant stream of frigid West Side Highway air being blown into our room. The temperature was a constant 50 degrees or below all night long (proof from iPhone reading). Management refused to comp our room. Reported to New York 311 for code violation. Worst hotel stay in New York in 20 years.",1,1
"We stayed at The Jane for one night and woke up to a 54 degree room.  I had to wear my winter coat in the room while I waited for my boyfriend to finish showering in the morning.  I discovered there was duct tape on our window attempting to stop a heavy draft- could feel the wind blowing!  The hotel let us know the city regulates their heat but they would have moved our room, given us a space heater, or had an engineer look into the issue when I called the front desk / provided feedback upon check out.  None of these options are conducive while getting ready for a day of business meetings at 7am and sound more like a convenient protection for the hotel for future repercussions.  From reading other reviews it appears they have had several complaints regarding AC and heat.  I",1,1
"With a maritime background, I had high hopes for The Jane.  The historic building, period decor and the location, were definitely worth the experience, what wasn't however, and this is where the screaming halt comes in: was the stench of cigarette smoke coming from some of the rooms.    Unfortunately, the Jane has some permanent residents, and the rules regarding no smoking in rooms common to other hotels do not apply.  I found the small rooms fine, the shared bathrooms were clean though at the edge of their preserved life; the bed was comfortable; and the heater was more than sufficient, but I really could not deal with the smoke coming from the room directly opposite. My coat, left hanging on the door and hair were both heavily affected and I started coughing and have eye",1,1
"We knew the room was small but we thought that at least we would have some space for the suitcases but there is not. The stuff at the reception very unfriendly and no ready to give up any useful information unless questioned. The toilet had a progress increase of dirtyness along the wweeken. We arrived on thursday and they were fairly clean, by Sunday they were horrible.the location is decent...however u need 10 minutes to get at the first metro. Overall...it is cheap but i would gladly spend 50 pounds more to be in a better hotel.",2,1
"If you want to be able to sleep, don't stay here.  There's a nightclub in the building and it's open until 4:00 am. I have earplugs in and the music is so loud that I can still hear it. The room is cold and there's no way to control the heat. It's 1:45 am, guess I'll lie here shivering all night.",1,1
Had pee on my pillow. Yellow stains. Horrible service. Never stay here. Staff is rude. Horrible bar. Bugs in room. No refund. Horrible horrible place. I would suggest closer to Times Square. People here are pretentious and nasty.,1,1
"My room is fine. I read online that the single cabins were 50 square feet, so I wasn't surprised. I am very disappointed to find that Cafe Gitane has closed. Not only that, but I have gone down to the reception every morning to inquire about coffee. I am always told that it's not ready yet. Really? No cafe is one thing. No coffee at all? If you need your brew in the morning, this is not the place for you. What a shame.",2,1
"I was due to stay at The Jane for 9 nights and checked out after 2. As other reviewers have highlighted, there is a bed bug problem (a Google search revealed several complaints about this at this hotel over several years. I woke at 4am on a Saturday morning to bites all over and found and killed two bugs in the sheets. All my possessions were taken to be heat-treated and I had to shower and move to a room on the fifth floor. The staff were very considerate and refunded me the cost of the night - no complaints about their service.  Unfortunately, more bugs were found in the new room and I chose to leave rather than continue my stay. I understand there is a bed bug problem in New York generally, but they really need to get on top of this.  I found the staff very pleasant and",2,1
Charming location but the staff was not helpful and rude + bathroom are mixed male and female.   I do not recommend this place the are not organized and the restaurent is not clean. I had to give my class of water back two time because of lipstick marks left on it. TWO TIME!,2,1
"The hotel itself is cute and full of old-world features. This unfortunately stretches to bed bugs. We woke with sore red bites on our legs, and when we reported this we had to change rooms and give all our belongings to staff to be treated - either blasted in heat or wiped with alcohol. The issue is obviously rife because they have a code word for the problem (BB's) and a set procedure they follow. The staff were rude and made us feel like we were causing an inconvenience to them. We were also given contradictory information from various members of staff about how long the treatment would take. After the process, my spectacles came back to me broken and when I reported the problem at reception, all they would say is ""we just wipe them with an alcohol wipe"" and wouldn't accept",1,1
"If you only read the first sentence of this review, simply DO NOT stay here. I travel to NYC once a year just to enjoy the city and get away for a weekend. This weekend I was traveling with my boyfriend for his birthday and it is wildly unfortunate that we booked our getaway weekend at this hotel. I'll start from the beginning, about a week before our trip I called to see if the hotel could put a bottle of champagne or something in the room to surprise my boyfriend for his birthday, I was quickly told ""no"" and provided no further assistance. I should have known then that the staff was going to be a problem.   The hotel itself is a neat building right on the river. Upon entering, however, it is clear how badly this hotel needs to be updated. It smells of dust and mildew as if it",1,1
"No idea why this place has such high ratings! Upon initial check-in, the bunk room my son and I were given smelled like horribly smelly feet! I went and requested another room and found that this one also smelled like feet. Guess that's just the general smell of the place. Settled in to rest after walking six hours or so around the city. Realized something was biting me! Told the person downstairs who acted like it's not a big deal and said there's nothing she can do other than move me to another room and hope that they don't have them. Wow, really? And don't ask for a manager, because there's no one on duty! I happen to be here at a bad time with the UN Assembly going on and the cheapest room I can find in Manhattan is $400! So we moved at 10PM to a $400 room... we were lucky",1,1
"I love the Chelsea area of Manhattan. The hotel was walking distance from The Whitney Museum, Chelsea Market and Google, all places I was visiting. However, upon dropping my luggage on the floor of my room, I ran back out into the hallway and asked the help where my bathroom was and she said ""Down the hall."" Bathroom facilities and showers were in an area shared by guests and weren't designated male or female. I know that many people are totally comfortable with this kind of arrangement, but I was not and it was not made clear when I booked the room that it did not come with a bathroom.",2,1
"We arrived around 11pm on a Saturday night and we weren't sure that we had the right address as there was a queue going around the block to the entrance.  It turns out we were there in fashion week and as such the ballroom had been hired every night of our stay for parties, as was the rooftop bar. We knew the rooms would be small, but not to be able to open a suitcase anywhere but on the bottom bunk was crazy.  There was so little space that I had to leave the room and wait in the lobby whilst my husband got ready each morning. When we arrived the aircon hadn't been on in the room so it was absolutely boiling, but as it was so loud we couldn't keep it on overnight. We frequently had to queue for the shared shower, toilet and sink facilities, despite being on 'UK time' still. Our",2,1
"I went here to have some drinks with friends one evening in the downstairs bar.  The atmosphere was quite nice, and the bar quite empty.  Afterwards, we decided to go upstairs to meet some more friends in the rooftop bar.  While the rooftop bar area was very nice, I thought that the staff was very rude.  The gentleman at the entrance of the bar was giving everyone quite a hard time getting in, in a non-polite way.  After telling him that our friends were there, we had to have 4 of them come to the door and get us.  I totally understand access control issues, but there is never a reason to be rude or obnoxious about it, unless there is an issue that warrants it (e.g. rude guests).    This soured my experience and I would not recommend it.",2,1
"The Jane seems to prioritize the bar scene, hundreds of people in the lobby, couldn't even get back into our hotel without pushing our way thru. Then, we didn't sleep at all because they were all out in the street below our window until 4 am, then the staff was cleaning up bottles loudly clanking them. Also, no in-room coffee, if you want a cup of coffee in the morning you have to pay $4 for a terrible & weak small cup from the cafe.",1,1
"If you are trying to find a comfortable, upscale place to spend an enjoyable trip.e DO NOT stay here.  We stayed in a captain's room, and according to the fire escape map on the door, we were placed in the absolute smallest room on the floor (about 50% smaller than all of the other rooms).  It didn't look anything like the pics on the online profile. (Maybe because we booked through a third party site they gave us the worst room?)  There was literally nowhere I could put my suitcase that wasn't in the way of a door (and we had neither a veranda NOR a view of the Hudson- at least one of which was promised in the room description).  I guess it didn't really matter because the windows were so dirty that we could barely see out.  It was in the 90's during our trip, and the air",2,1

Maybe I am one of the few to say this but it was pretty gross. Not only was there mold in the toilet and shower but hair from previous visitors. The room was hot and muggy as were the hallways and the elevator. It felt as if it hadn't been clean in a long time. I refused to walk around without shoes. The only thing good about this hotel was the location.,1,1
"We have spent four nights here. Before we arrived we have read the reviews and they were all pretty positive and we can certainly see the appeal - the location, the atmosphere, as long as you do not need any space besides the place for sleeping, it is satisfactory. But here's the thing - as long as you have two luggages (which, to be honest, fair amount of tourists have) it is virtually impossible to live in the room. That is not an overstatement, with two luggages on the ground there isn't space for any movement, for any manipulation, for nothing. So when we went out we delayed ourselves just because one of us had to do the business with the luggage and the other had to be on the bunk and then switch. The corridors are fairly clean but there is a cigarette smell, the bathrooms",2,1
"I stayed at this hotel in mid July for 4 nights and I have to say that my stay there definitely prompted a concise but brief review. Check in was actually quite smooth, the front desk staff and bell men were both super helpful. Randy, the front desk attendant (I think that's his name) was awesome! I was checked into my room about 30 mins prior to the start of check in time which was also nice. I'd read countless reviews and looked at numerous photos prior to arriving so I knew exactly what to expect. I opted for the standard cabin with shared bathroom  for budget purposes (sharing a bathroom was my main concern but actual was pretty good considering its shared.) Everything was pretty much spot on, the room was tiny. I mean SMALL. I couldn't imagine more than one person staying",2,1

"My one week stay at the Jane Hotel was okay. In short, I would stay here again only if I couldn’t afford anything else. And I would not recommend staying here with children or if you have a several tobacco smoke allergy. At times I felt uncomfortable, bordering on unsafe. I felt there was a disconnect between the care taken for the bar/nightclub patrons and hotel guests.  The price was affordable, and the staff were generally polite, professional, and friendly. They stored my luggage upon arrival and upon check-out.  A short time before leaving on vacation I read about problems with smokers at The Jane. I was very concerned about this because I had confirmed it was a non-smoking hotel before booking. I emailed The Jane before my arrival and they clarified it is a non-smoking",2,1
"On May 21st, when I returned to my room at around 5.30 pm, I found that the it wasn't done, and there was a bag of garbage on my bed, that of course I hadn't left there.  This situation was not only discomforted, but totally filthy and unhealthy.  All I got was, ""We are sorry"". Imagine  how sorry I was! Off course the cover wasn't changed, and I had to sleep on that bed. I really doubt about the housekeeping management at this hotel, and I believe they do not follow any regulations concerning the cleanliness.  I will not return to this hotel again. This was a very disgusting situation and hadn't been attended as it should've been.",1,1
"I booked this hotel as one of the few which catered for single travellers in New York with the added bonus of it being in the West Village.    Location was great, few minutes to subway and lots of evening options close by. It is however on the side of the main road running alongside the Hudson.  This  made for lots of traffic noise constantly. Better Windows would easily rectify this problem. I was relieved that the noise from the bar/club was not an issue for me and I had read lots of reviews that it could be very loud.  The room was fine, as expected it was tiny but enough for what I needed. Wifi was available in the room and although a bit slow, it was fine for what I needed. The bathroom also was fine, clean and with really good showers.   My main bugbear was the fact that",2,1
"The biggest thing this hotel has going for it is location. Love that it was near high line and so convienent to walk the Village too. The room itself of course is small, which was fine. I stay d two nites and no towel change at all. Annoying.    Decided to take stairs down, I was on the 5th, and I don't think stairwell had been swept in maybe a year. Dead coachroachs  were a sight to behold.    The bellman where I had my key held, had attitude plus, as I assume it was annoying to him for me to pick up my key.   I will not stay here again.",2,1
"I should start by saying I wouldn't have chosen this hotel, hotels.com moved me here after my original hotel cancelled. IF you don't mind sharing a bathroom (which was clean) and don't mind a minuscule room, this place is fine. My only issue was the music blasting out. I was so tired from travelling that I could barely register what was happening. I 'think' it went on from 10:30 until 4, and that was a Tuesday.  Due to the small rooms, and bathroom arrangements I had already put in headphones and was listening to music to help me sleep. The nightclub music was vibrating through my mattress, ensuring a restless night.",2,1

Last night I went there as a part of a really big group, we were like 18 people and were basically the only customers there and since we all wanted to dance we asked the DJ to play some R&B and top 40 hits. She basically refused to play anything but her horrible 80s-90s chill out music and when I told her that she should play music closer to what we wanted she told me that we could all leave and proceeded to CURSE AT ME REPEATEDLY. I mean WHAT is wrong with that woman, she's a serious awful, mean, crass person. If you ever go there and see this DJ, run for the hills, I know I would.",1,1
"This hotel was awful.  It was so bad that we were booked for two nights, but left after just one.  It was so bad that we rebooked at a different hotel, at great personal expense.  It should be noted that we booked the nicest room at the Jane (called the Captain's Room).    Firstly, we arrived and they gave us a room that didn't have heat.  They then gave us another room that had heat (albeit very little).  Another important detail about this room: it was directly above their night club, which closes at 4 AM.  Between the thumping music and revelers in the street, I could not sleep one wink.    The hotel was extremely cold, which was worsened by the fact that their beds have very little when it comes to covers.  Our bed had only a thin blanket, which did not suffice for a 62",1,1

"This place has the potential to be awesome - great location, cool decor and long history. Sadly it is let down by a number of things.   When we arrived we were put on level 4 and no sooner had we put our bags down we noticed a strong smell of cigarette smoke coming into our room followed by the smell of cooking. This smell continued for some time so I spoke to a staff member who advised me that it was due to permanent residents that reside at the hotel. These permanent residents are those that remain from when the Jane was  used as low cost housing. So essentially you're sharing with residents of a boarding house.   Luckily we were immediately offered a new room but had to wait till the following night to stay on a level without any smokers (levels 3 and 4 have smokers).",2,1
"My stay at The Jane was Hell.  I arranged lodgings for the day of 12 Jan. stipulating I would be checking in at 1am that morning.  I was given a verbal confirmation (twice) that this was acceptable as I was leaving NYC that morning.  When I arrived, exhausted from flight the desk attendant had no record of this.  At 2:30 am I was still renegotiating the booking.  I will skip the difficulty of that.  Once in room 610 the temperature was 93, even with the window and door cracked.  At 3:30 I was moved to a room where the air conditioning worked and I finally fell asleep.  The documentation and charges reflected on my card are a mess.  There are charges that reflect $144.00 for the inconvenience I caused the hotel.  Hopefully that charge will disappear, as well as the $86.00 hold in",2,1
"After reading so many good reviews, and the location is close to where I live in West Village. I booked the hotel for 6 nights for my mom's visit. Checking-in was fabulous with the front desk Kevin, who was very pleasant and helped to choose a room with a view of the Hudson River. 2nd night, she woke up with freezing cold feet and realized there was no heat in the room. She contacted the front desk, the front desk (2 am) was room and only offered a blanket. She had to put on extra socks and fleece to keep warm ... until the day light.  I called the hotel around 8 am, a friendly Jose went to my mom's room (#301) with space heater, and checked on the radiator and said they were closed!!!!  Then the room was either too cold or too hot the next few days/nights. I don't think anyone",2,1

We were out to dinner at Sevilla with family and friends (whom included a Managing Director from Cantor Fitzgerald, a VP from Barclays and myself, a Chief of Staff; and I am only mentioning this to set a tone that we were not dressed inappropriately and are used to visiting these kind of venues on a daily; in fact, I believe it was the complete opposite, we may have been dressed too conservative and our skirts may have not been short enough).

Having stayed in numerous cheaper rooms in NYC before, including both bunkbed and shared bathroom options, I must say that these rooms were just too small for my liking.   Approximately 4-5 square meters, no private sink, and with no possibility to put suitcases beneath the bed.   For the 6 nights we stayed the room was cleaned only once.   Not a huge problem, perhaps, but at least having the thrashcan emptied more often would have been OK.  It was quite humid a few days in NYC this time, and that definitely did not add to the attractiveness of a tiny room.    On the positive side; Location, very friendly employees, price!

"Be aware of the following. 146.93 is the price for one night (125 USD + taxes etc) plus 50 USD for ""incindentals""... You must, in other words, be prepared to pay 197 USD per night at Janes, for the cheapest alternative. And you do have to pay it on arrival x nights you are booked for.  You will of course get back the 50 USD for ""incidentals""  approx 6 to 10 days after your check out. If you can afford this, and have a shared bathroom, go for it, if not take another option.",2,1
"Our room was literally the size of a closet, and we did not have space to even lie two suitcases down flat. Although the location is great, I am surprised that the rooms pass muster for a hotel given how small they are, and there is no turndown service. (i.e. no fresh towels, etc.) It has all the no frills of a hostel without the fun vibe of a hostel. Will not stay there again.",2,1
"Very expensive for what it was, and when we arrived we were put in the tiniest room that smelled of feet and above a noisy road (room 202, I believe). We asked if there was another room available and was told we could move the next day which was fine. The next room (206) was a million times better - much bigger, had a lovely huge bath, and access to a patio (noisy due to all the air con units, but nice to be able to get outside). Location is great, and the decor was quite quirky but that's where the positives end....  The real deciding factor was on the Friday night when myself and my boyfriend intended to have a drink in the bar before bed (around 10pm I think).

Since this is New York, bars and clubs are open until 4am.   When I called the front desk at 1am, their response was ""whoops, yeah, nobody told you? Let me see if there is another room [3 seconds of fake typing] no, sorry, yes, the bar closes at 4, have a good night.""  In short, if you like funky decor (and powerful showers) and have no desire to actually sleep at your hotel, then maybe the Jane is right for you. Anyone who actually needs to get some sleep should stay far far away.",1,1
"I entered with my friend on a Thursday night around 12:30 am. Two bouncers demanded that we all form a line. When I answered back saying ""what line? There's a line?"" Three employees (bouncers) immediately kicked me out and told me to leave the premises like I was a criminal. I was kicked out because I spoke out as a woman. I have attended night clubs/bars in New York, Miami, Southern California, and Europe, and have never been so degraded like this.  I will never go here again. I could've told hundreds of friends, but no, this place is tainted.   Ashamed!  Nicole Lopez-Alvar",1,1
"It's a funky place that's a cool idea -- in the world's tiniest non-pod room I really did feel like I was on a ship. But a) the ""cabin"" smelled strongly of cigarette smoke and b) worse: doors slamming all night long. Loudly. Every five minutes. Until about 5 am when the door slammers finally settled down. One of the worst nights of sleep I've had in years and I have a toddler at home. Ironically, my room was pretty soundproof other than that. But absolutely insane, impossible to sleep through door slamming. So nuts that they haven't addressed this. Never coming back.",2,1
"The Jane is a budget hotel in an excellent location within the meatpacking district of nyc. The style of the hotel is very quirky and the shared toilets are some of the cleanest and best maintained I've seen. This said, it is not a hotel I would recommend based on my experience. Staff across the hotel were consistently unwelcoming and at times it would say verging on rude. We stayed in one of the bunk bed cabin rooms. While I understand this is a budget option these rooms are NOT appropriate for two people with bags. They were cramped and uncomfortable. Finally the rooftop bar which had been a selling point for us to book is only open Thursday to Sunday. We found this disappointing. All in all we felt the idea of the hotel was on the right lines but it fell extremely short on",2,1
May be newyork city is small in a area but the hotel room shouldnt be that small so that it becomes difficult to stay there i could not breathe i felt like suffocated inside my room and wow and i paid $270 for two nights so expensive!! The rooms are very very small i didnt liked it at all felt like im in a small cage .... They should have made little bigger room and have asked more money !!,1,1
"Very rude staff.. I Tried to go and visit friends from the city who were inside, and was told by the bouncer very rudely that ""not everyone is welcome, and I'm just not one of them"" because I didn't have a guest list. He proceeded to make fun of me and told me to ""turn around, and get out of his bar""  I wasn't offended that I wasn't allowed in, I understand the concept of guest list.. But his condescending tone was unnecessary and a total turn off. I was very polite the entire time (I mean, I'm showing up late without a guest list, I have to be nice) but the entire staff there wasn't worth anyone's breath.   I am happy to not waste my money at this place. All my group left at this point and will never return... Gladly.",1,1

"We enjoyed our stay until we woke up and my husband and I were covered (literally covered in all parts of our bodies) with insect bites.  We are still severely impacted by these bites, which are red and swollen and extremely itchy. We appreciated that the Jane comped us the room in consideration of this but we are justifiably very concerned about the possibility that we may have brought bed bugs or fleas home with us, despite our best efforts to shower and launder all our possessions and clothing.  The extent of the infestation, as evidenced by the number of bites we received in a single night, tells us that this is not a new problem.   Unacceptable.",1,1
"Stayed here on 2 alternate nights, both times I experienced noisy guests talking and the banging of doors all night. There was vomit in the sink in the shared bathroom on the first night and the carpets were disgusting. To be honest I couldn't wait to check out, this place isn't clean at all, which is a shame as the rooms are really unique. I thought the experience was going to be good but I was disappointed.",2,1
"A club which used to be great. You'll now find over there disgusting cocktails, bad dj and a staff considering you as dumb... No doubt, I would prefer a dirty dive bar to this place. That's too bad for this beautiful old fashion hotel. The direction should change all of it soon in way to preserve the Hotel from this kind of disappointment...",1,1
"Seriously, I understand that New York is expensive and Jane's cheap price is what lured me into but if you can add extra $20-$30 a night please do and stay somewhere better. Pocket rooms and shared showers is its key so I'm not criticizing that but the whole hotel has a terribly unpleasant smell all through out and it's easy to notice that people staying there are simply weird or obviously on a budget. I feel bad for myself and wouldn't recommend anyone this experience.",1,1
"I used to swear by The Jane -- where else can you find a hotel in a top location for around $100 in NYC? Of course you need to be an adventurous type -- these rooms are insanely tiny - like ships cabins -- around 4' wide by 7' long. They are not the kind of room you'll linger in -- extremely bad if you're claustrophobic. My recent trip was my third time staying there, and the first in a few years. The common bathroom which was once beautiful in look and function still looks good, but the fixtures no longer work reliably -- toilet seats that are barely attached to toilets, funky showers that don't work well even once you've figured out how to use them. This may have been the first time I've been there when it was really full... but the fact that all the room doors close with a",2,1
"We stayed in a Captain's Room, the most expensive room type at the Jane.  Really wish we hadn't.  The location is fantasic but the room was small, hot (fan and aircon were ineffective and noisy), and outdated.  The Captain's rooms are all also on the West side, overlooking the Hudson (through tiny windows), and also a main highway (the noise of which is impossible to ignore, even on the fourth floor).  Facilities are basic, there is no kettle in the room so you can't make tea or coffee.  Worst of all of the service.  The staff on the front desk are very unfriendly, the policy seems to be that you have to wait until 3pm to check in, regardless of whether your room might be ready earlier.  We stayed 5 nights and twice had to deal with returning to our room and finding that our key",2,1
Extremely disrespectful staff. They pick and choose who they want to let in the bar. They told us to step aside and exit and EVERYONE in the line after us were allowed to entered but not us. I think they were very racist. That's discrimination. Even on edge of their other staff member agreed that was not fair.,1,1
"Where to start?  Rooms fine, window to Hudson tiny, overall somewhat clean and front desk clerks were better than average.  Problem is The Jane decides that ""handsy"" bouncers should run the hotel after a certain hour.  If you use to friendly front doormen who are happy to help you out, this hotel is not your place.  On two separate occasions the same bouncer laid his hand on me which is considered assault in most quarters as I attempted to access the hotel.  The first time I had run to my car to get my wife her items, since she was still in the room and in order to make the lights work you have to leave your key in the wall, I didn't have that 1 pound key with me.  I went to the car and on return this bouncer rudely stopped me and at first wouldn't allow me to enter.  Luckily",1,1
"I never got a response or apology from the hotel to my complaint, so I will share it with you.  My stay was pretty much encompassed by the rudeness of your reception staff when I checked out who refused to admit they had change for $20 when I paid my room service bill, and made out like I was mentally challenged when I asked if they had any drinks I could buy because the cafe was closed.   I felt harassed as a single woman using the bathroom and was very scared at night to use the facilities. Im usually very happy to share, so this is not usually a problem. On multiple occasions I had very sleazy men pass comments and flirt with me, two even trying to make a pass and get my room no. This is not acceptable, and should be monitored if there are going to be shared facilities where",1,1
"There's a lot to like about The Jane Hotel: it's charming, the lobby is lovely, the location (while a bit far from the subway) is close to The Village, and it's just about the cheapest private room you'll find in Manhattan. But after a couple visits, I think I'm through. For one thing the place is showing signs of wear. For example: I could feel the mattress springs on the narrow cot sized bed. The carpets are looking a little dirty. I noticed that the hallways looked in need of a vacuum. Mainly though, I'm tired of waking up and finding a strange man in a bathrobe brushing his teeth in the co-ed bathrooms. I'm finished with the coffin sized rooms (especially the ones with bunk beds that make you feel even more claustrophobic.) I don't think I could take another sweltering night",2,1
"The room was 3.5sm. You have the bed (90*200), and the some space (80*200) next to it. No sink, no table, no wardrobe, no chair, no air. The room temperature (in winter) was around 30 celsius degree, and the mini window just cannot let in as much cold air as it would be needed. Positive: staff is really kind, shared bathroom clean, you can go home even late in the evening.",2,1
"I have delayed my review as I had a follow up email from the company that own The Jane asking for my comments - so emailed my comments and was waiting for their response.  Been over a month and nothing, so here it is:  I was really looking forward to this hotel and I am gutted to review that I was hugely disappointed.  I went with an open mind and appreciated that the rooms would be small but they are so tiny....two people with normal size suitcases can hardly fit in and it takes a lot of awkward manoeuvring!  The communal showers were nice and we didn't really have to queue much.  What really lets it down is the lack of communal area, as the rooms are so claustrophobic you just want to escape them and go sit somewhere. On their website it mentions and shows photos of a ballroom",2,1
"The title of my review is the best way I would describe The Jane. Its in a great location and the staff was friendly This place is like a hostel, tiny rooms and shared bathrooms. I stayed here because everything else was sold out. I'm not sure about the good value that everyone is referring to. I did opt for the room with its own bathroom and that cost was what I usually pay for a 5 star diamond hotel. I was there for three nights and eventually found somewhere else to stay.  The room was so small that I couldn't fit all of my luggage. The lobby was pretty and the elevator is operated by staff so it can take some time since there's only one. My room had one small window facing the river and it was fairly quiet.   If you're flying solo and exploring the city, this might be the",2,1
"I'm new to NYC and picked this place based on booking.com reviews (it had 8.0 score at the time of my booking and sounded like a very reasonable deal). I though the tiny rooms and shared toilets and showers accounted for the lower price... Well, I was WRONG.  The best one-work description for this place I can come up with is ""erratic"". See for yourself: I arrived around 8pm after an overnight flight and a full day at the office, was warmly greeted and shown into a tiny and perhaps a dash smelly, but reasonably cozy room with a bunk bed. I pretty much went straight to bed only to wake up at 6am next morning itching from bed bug bites and shivering from the cold -- apparently during the night some guests complained of it being too warm, so the staff decided to switch the heating",1,1
"The Jane has all of the elements we usually love in a hotel: history, location, affordability and a good dose of ""quirk"" thrown in for good  measure. In this case, even the quirk and charm couldn't salvage our experience. We were in the city for a long weekend in mid October  for work and play, and booked a Captain's room, a  larger and more $$ room than the berths we had seen pics of on Yelp and TripAdvisor.   When we checked in, we were given a choice of a river view on the upper floors, or a side room w street view. Well..duh!  As we entered the room, which was mediocre, dark, and small, we opened the very small window, and were blasted by an overwhelming amount of traffic noise (West Side Highway).  If the room had been nicer, we would have stayed and just dealt with it, but",2,1
The Jane is quirky and bohemian-- just like many parts of the surrounding neighborhood-- and that's fun. But it's also pretty tired-- from the lobby to the hallways to the rooms. And it's cramped. And dark. We stayed in a Captain's Cabin with double bed-- smaller than a queen size bed but not too small-- and a private bathroom. There was one small window-- really small because a good chunk of it was given over to the air conditioning unit.  If you really want the bohemian feeling this may be the place for you. Given the expense-- and what you get for it-- we'll stay elsewhere.,2,1
"There is a popular nightclub in this hotel -- directly under the hotel rooms on the 2nd floor.   Unless you plan to be at the nightclub until 4am when it closes, DO NOT stay on the 2nd floor.  It is extremely loud and you will not sleep, but it will be too late to change rooms.  You will be awake until 4AM!  Other than that, the staff is friendly and the rooms are nice.  Location is good for Meatpacking shopping and eating.",2,1
"My review has little to do with the hotel itself - my friend and I passed through NYC for a day and stayed here, and the experience itself was wonderful. Quirky, charming, etc.  However, when I looked at my card this morning, I saw that I'd been charged $65 extra for the room my friend and I stayed in. When I called the Jane to ask why, I spoke to a flippant, rude employee who gave me a half-assed explanation that had something to do with taxes and deposits and possibly getting some of the money back. I told him (in a clear, reasonable tone, not an angry one) that I found that practice misleading, since the email I received said that the total rate I'd pay would be $135, and he proceeded to belittle me until I cried: raising his voice, interrupting me, and saying that there was",1,1
"The Jane has historic significance both as a rooming house for sailors and as the gathering place for survivors of the Titanic, so it held a lot of interest for me. The architecture and atmosphere are, indeed, striking but the handsome bar and dining areas are not open to hotel guests; they were reserved for private parties. Despite the very good location and seemingly low price for a NY hotel, I would not go back. I checked out after one night although I had reserved for three.   Keep in mind that the rooms were designed for sailors who are used to tiny quarters. For me, the room was dark and claustrophobic. (I couldn't see well enough inside it to tell if the room was clean.) When a friend visited, only one of us could stand up at a time; the other had to sit on the bed. One,",2,1
"Tiny rooms. Rooms and hallways smell of stale cheese. Pillows smell like someone farted in to them. Dusty windowsills and most importantly a couple of the reception men seem to have a bee in their bonnet and are obviously extremely bitter at the fact that they are merely hotel workers. Miserable and obnoxiously rude, especially the man with the goatee beard. Also public hairs in the shower.",1,1
"To be fair, I had the smallest possible... To really put it in perspective of how small the rooms are, a man under 6 ft could touch both walls width wise (easily) at the same time. The room was about half the size of an average walk in closet, maybe 7 feet, by 3.5 feet. Community bathrooms on each floor (with a bit of a line). If you're young, on a budget, and don't care about sharing a bathroom with 60 other people, this is for you!",2,1
"After reading so many great reviews I figured I'd give this place a try.  I wanted to write this review to warn people about the potential nightmare they may face if they choose to stay here.  The Jane has bed bugs.  If I felt that this place actually treated the rooms properly to attempt to remove the problem then I wouldn't be so harsh, but I highly doubt that this place takes the steps necessary to rid its rooms of bed bugs.   I stayed here July 5-8.  I cut my stay by a night after finding bed bugs.  That's when my nightmare began and my trip took a turn for the worst.  I noticed the bites on my arm and a few on my legs.  After seeing a bug on my bed I went immediately to the front desk and told them.  They seemed to doubt that I had bed bugs even after I showed them my arm",1,1
"I stayed at the Jane hotel in Oct 13 and it was a terrible hotel. The staff weren't friendly at all and the rooms were tiny, I really do mean tiny. Only one person could get changed at a time while the other sat on the bed then we would have to change to allow the other to get ready. Noise rooms with a night club in the hotel and air con was very noisy as well. We had two choices no air con and roast all night or put the noisy air con on and not sleep all night, I suppose either way it was hard to get any sleep. When asking for a change in room so we were away from the night club we were told we could be moved at a $100 a night charge! The shared bathrooms were ok if you managed to get them first thing in the morning otherwise they weren't up to my standard. Would never",1,1

"We stayed in a Captain's cabin, so I can't complain about the space.   It was maybe a little overpriced for the amount of room we got but somewhat in line with a regular hotel.  But the noise was worse than I've ever experienced in any hotel.  There seemed to be a window open all night but we couldn't find where.  There is a nightclub downstairs and the loud conversations, drunken screaming and horn honking were all clearly discerable until the place closed down at 4:00.  It was like trying to sleep in the middle of a loud party.    I give a poor rating, rather than terrible, because the day staff was very helpful and friendly.  After dark the nightclub staff apparently takes over and they are very, very unfriendly, even trying to block us from entering the building.    If you",2,1

They lost our credit card information a number of times. We've resent three times and physically visited the hotel to go through it all with them too.

At 9pm the room's smoke detector sounded approximately 8 times.  The battery was replaced.  At 4:15am the detector again sounded numerous times, waking me up from my sleep.  The staff removed the detector from the room, which concerned me in the event a fire were to occur.  I was told to e-mail the Front Desk Manager, who would compensate me for my loss of sleep.  Several weeks later they responded saying the MAY be able to give me a DISCOUNT on a future stay.

There are more than 50 rooms per floor, all sharing a total of four showers, two large sinks, and four toilets.  Not surprisingly there is a strong smell of mildew that was almost overpowering especially when brushing my teeth.

"It may be unfair to write a true review as I ended up not staying here. I did have a reservation, I did show up and check in, I did go up to my room. At that point I pretty much headed back to the desk and checked out. First, the place smelled moldy, and the communal bathrooms (which are very communal) smelled like they hadn't been cleaned in days. The room was so small that next to the bed there was not actually room for both me and my suitcase to fit in the room with any space left for movement. The lighting system is bizarre, the wi-fi was non-existent. Five minutes was enough to have me leave. The only saving grace was the friendliness and understanding of the desk clerk, who checked me out without charge, though with the comment, ""this happens all the time, don't worry",2,1

Not what you want when you are trying to recharge for another days sightseeing in NYC.  I was staying on the 3rd floor and there were some strange odours coming from somewhere. Not sure if it was smoke or the carpets or what. There were also a few noisy inconsiderate people who like to slam doors, talk etc at all hours of the night.

Smushed it and recoiled in horror. Thence began the five-hour saga in which hotel staff basically stripped me, asked me to take a shower, put me in another room, and took all my belongings for some alleged anti-bedbug treatment variously described as steam cleaning, heating to 100, heating to 120, heating to 140, and using a Pack-Rite device. No idea which if any of these explanations was correct, because when I got my stuff back at 5 am, nothing appeared to have been done to my belongings, certainly not any heating to 120 or 140 or else my cosmetics would have melted.

Cafe Gitane (the restaurant downstairs) is wonderful. And I will say, the staff we dealt with were very warm and considerate. Our 2nd floor room had an amazing patio, that if it were nicer weather, we would have definitely used. The small downsides we noticed right away were that 1) our T-Mobile cell phones did not work at all (not even on wifi), and 2) the bed was not comfortable at all.

No vents, no central heat, just a radiator on the outside wall.  I pulled back the cover to an inch of dust on the floor behind it, I turned both knobs to full on.  It never warmed up.  Room was around 65 the whole night.  All the windows leaked, no weather proofing, wind just gushing in.

Which I'm sure is really cool for photoshoots or a drink downstairs, but I would highly advise against actually sleeping here.

"Quirky and Charming combined with cramped, broken and noisy. The Jane is, admitedly, not your average hotel. It is affordable but the room we chose was a double w bath and the heat worked....we reached 90 degrees before we figured out how to manually adjust the baseboard heat ( on our knees, behind the sheet metal cladding). Plumbing traps had to be out of code as well as we could smell sewage gas in the bath until we closed and covered the drains.  The rooms were clean and very small but that didn't hinder our sleep or enjoyment of the surrounding area. The second night of our stay the Hotel had a DJ in their lounge and we could hear and feel every noise till 3 AM. A call to the night manager was fruitless. Quirky, yes. Charming, no.",2,1
"I have done my homework prior to the stay and so there were no surprises. Shared a bunk bed room with another buddy for 2 nights and that was enough. Room was as a big as a car park lot. So go figure how 2 grown man elbow ourselves as we tried to change clothes etc. Luckily both of us travelled light so luggage storage wasn't an issue. But then again, treat it as a place just to sleep, so should be ok. Toilets were clean, but then again, sharing a common toilet may not appeal to many. The elevator broke down during my stay and climbing stairs weren't fun. Room is musty and dark. Thankfully it's winter - I wonder how people deal with summer....ALL THE BEST IF YOU ARE ON THE CHEAP! Cheers!",2,1
"I was coming back from a buisness trip in Texas and decided to stay in New York for 2 nights for some traveling.  Unfortunately either due to the hurricane or holiday season most of the hotels were either fully booked or very expensive. This seemed like the only decent option (based on tripadvisor reviews) for 150$ a night.   I am a young guy and I've been in the army spending about a month sleeping in a tent in the middle of the desert so I guessed nothing can be that bad right?  As I arrived in the hotel I was given room 338. The elevator was broken, so it was either having the staff carrying my bad upstairs or taking it myself. I knew the room was going to be small, but never thought it would be *that* small. My room was close to the bathroom and the shower, so each time",2,1
"My fiance and I live in Brooklyn, and we recently spent two nights at The Jane while the furnace in our building was being replaced and we had no heat/hot water. As former West Villagers, we have long been big fans of Cafe Gitane and we love the hotel bar. So it was especially disappointing to have such an unpleasant first (and last) stay in the hotel itself. We checked into room 205 on our first night. The room was perfectly fine, if a bit noisy, with nice river views. On night #2, we made our way back up to 205 and were completely confused to find another couple's belongings in our room. We went back down to the front desk where we were told that housekeeping had moved us to room 218, though no one could explain why, and we were told to speak with the manager the next morning.",1,1
"I went alone to this hotel in august 2012. I traveled a lot in my life and this has been definetly my worst experience. First of all, i was in New York to visit the city and i was looking only for a bed, nothing more, so the room which was around 4 feet x 10 feet did not scare me. Also the bed, which was long about 6 feet did not scare me even if i could not sleep on my back. The most terrible thing was the air conditioning, infact, despite the temperature in my room was always more than 80, the conditioner was very incredibly noisy. I slept three hour and then i did check out. Never again, adieu The Jane.",1,1
"I usually stay at The Jane but this was my last trip there. It was the first time I got one of the smaller rooms and we did this as there were no Captains rooms available. The room smelled like feet and there were a lot of people smoking (on the 3rd floor anyway!) Worst of all there was NO air, no fan, NOTHING! We just laid there and sweat. It cost $160.00 for the night which I know is considered a bargain in NYC but we got NO sleep and left pretty upset the next day. I know ""It's Only Rock and Roll"" but I don't like it.",1,1

Since the US is one of our favorite destinations, we decided this year to revisit Philadelphia, Washington and to end the trip, as always, in NY. This is the first time - ever - that we'll be glad to leave NY. The reason for this is the hotel, The Jane. My wife and I stayed 4 nights: 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 May 2012. After our first day of visiting NY, we came back to room 214 and found the glasses we used the night before still standing dirty on the table, the bathtub wasn't cleaned and there were only two small towels left.

"Arrived last night, directly from my family home, one night of no sleep because of the nightclub. I was in room 461, they moved me today to another room, then found a bed bug. So, I had to be showered, whilst they waited for my clothes, which were then steamed, as was the rest of my things. A staff member had to go through everything I have. The process is necessary, but violating. I have now been in my room for nearly 4hrs, in the ribe provided, and still have to wait for another 2hrs. They have offered me a free drink to compensate!! A few of the staff are rude and arrogant, and not too helpful.  So, not even one day into my 3 week stay, and all I want to do is go home.  The Jane? Dont do it.",1,1
"Whatever you do - wherever you stay - please, make sure it's NOT this hotel. It's popular among European travelers (maybe because it reads like a hostel?)  FILTHY. SMOKY. DISGUSTING. GREASY. These are words I would use to describe the hotel.  There were pubes and dust/dirt in the corners of the shared his/her bathrooms. The water temperature did not come up fast, leaving you standing in a puddle of water in the shower (the drain is apparently set to not drain until you are done completely. Gross.  There isn't a place other than hooks on the back of the door to put your stuff. Hello? Toiletries? Shoes?

"I kind of like the Jane, I'll admit it. I like its quirkiness, price, and location. Why am I giving it a terrible rating, because in my six stays there I have never had a problem free stay. Problems have ranged from web site reservation problems, to noisy rooms, to being verbally told I had a 2 day reservation and showing up to find I had only a one day stay and my second day was sold out. Problem resolution has been grudging at best to downrite hostile. There are other quirky, inexpensive well located places to stay in NYC. For me it's no longer worth the hassle I have to put up with to stay here and I suggest you don't either.",1,1
"What have could have been great experience ended up in a big disapointment. The whole style and website has a very positive spirit. And coming into the hotels is also very nice with the dressed employees. But the room......closet where you sleep in is very disapinting. It is a little more than 1,5 by 2,0 m with only a bed of 80 cm by 190 cm, The lounch bar will make this good. But the toilet on my floor was too dirty to sit on. Ok you can go to another place as man to the toilet. Because the lounge was very nice and there would be a DJ playing from 23PM I decided to come with my friends to the hotel. The bad thing was that we where rejected. Rekection is not a problem but how they treat you with rejecting you while you are a client in the building is really disapointing,",2,1
"After reading a number of fantastic reviews about this budget glory, I was sure that we were going to get along just fine.  I was wrong.  In college, I lived in the dorms and, At the time, it seemed like glamorous fun to share a 150 square foot room with another person, and share bathrooms down the hall with everyone on my floor.  In retrospect?  It sucked.  To compare, this is even worse.  The Bed: at 5'6 I reach the end of the mattress when I lie down.  This means that my feet are practically in the shelves at the end of the bed.  Also, the matress thickness is about that of a cot.  Not comfortable.  I suppose they try to balance this by having feather pillows and high threadcount sheets but it just seems a pittance.  The noises: You can hear everything.  Your next door",1,1
"We stayed in this centrally located hotel in October 2011 for 4 nights. I am aware that finding good hotels in New York is difficult but when paying £250 (pounds not dollars) per night you expect something decent. The hotel itself wasn’t bad - just medicore. However if you want some sleep do not stay here. The rooms are not very well sound proofed at all and there is a bar downstairs playing loud music until 4am. We complained about the noise from the bar (located inside the hotel) only to be told that there was nothing they could do because they had no jurisdiction over the bar - this was at 3.30am. I could here the conversation the people in the rooms next door were having often word for word.   Even in the city that apparently never sleeps, the tourists that visit it do want",2,1
"The Jane is a neat hotel and is super cute and the food in the restaurant is pretty darn good and the bar is cute. For New York the rooms (the ones with private bathrooms) are spacious and nice and the bathrooms are cute with a nice bathtub as are the outdoor decks. However, at best, it will cost you $400 a night and it does not seem worth it at all. Especially when you consider this: starting at around 10 PM (on weekends at least) loud music cranks up (specifically The Pony by Ginuine over and over again) with amplified bass and it is super loud, I can sleep through anything, but not this. During our stay, around 2 AM when this was still going on I called downstairs and the person at the desk - who seemed to be very used to getting calls about the noise levels - said that the",2,1
"I stayed at the Jane Hotel Sept/2011. Woke up to find bedbugs crawling under my pillowcase and all over me! I was bit at least 40 times. I had a severe allergic reaction and had to go to the Hospital. The man working the desk that night was very blase, he didn't even call a cab for me. He said "" well, it would be faster if you walked up the street"" REALLY? I'm covered in swollen welts and you tell me i can ""walk up the street? They had taken all my belongings to their "" onsite"" fumigator to try to disinfect my belonging..Well, you know you have a problem when you keep the solution on site!

I won't speak of the bed bugs, as that' already been addressed in other posts. But, hey, to have a sleepless night in a 125 / night room is ridiculous. Then, the shower turned cold after 5 minutes, and I was asked by the front staff if ""that got my heart beating"", verbatim. So, in a nutshell, that part of my life is over, and I'm back to the Park Ave. Kimpton where life is well, civil again, and I have a room with correct, livable temperature, no bedbugs, and a shower that provides hot water.

I called the front desk and told them that I was getting bitten and asked if we could switch rooms. I wanted to leave but since it was the middle of the night I figured we could try another room.

I have now been home for 4 nights and I can't sleep because of the itching!! I did some more research and realized that it has to be bed bugs. Luckily I suspected that so washed everything at home.

"I just stayed at the Jane for four nights when I was in NYC for the marathon.  First of all, my room was $325 a night, not including tax, which seemed very steep, even for NYC.  My room was tiny, with about 2 1/2 feet of space between the bed and the walls.  The bathroom was a nice size, however.  The hotel staff was generally very pleasant and helpful.  The hotel is located on the west side highway, so I can only imagine how loud the rooms are on this side of the hotel.  When I checked in I asked for a quiet room and was told that my room faced Jane Street, so it would probably be not be too loud.

We had all our belongings taken away for steam treatment and were moved to room 342,  another bunk room.   Unfortunately room 342 had bugs as well and we had to go through the whole treatment regime again. We were then moved to a captains cabin room 218.

Me & my friend were on the second leg of a trip to Toronto and New York and had been travelling for 12 hours on a Greyhound and just wanted to dump our bags, get a shower and get back out to see the sights.    When we got there the hotel staff were really friendly, helpful and speedy.  We got up to our floor and got a bit lost with the layout.  The number of the room was not on the key so it got a bit confusing when we got the room number wrong.    We got to the room and could not believe how small it was!  There was the two bunk beds and then about a foot of space in between the beds and the wall/mirror.  Therefore we couldn't get dressed at the same time.",2,1
"This is my second time staying at The Jane and it was disappointing. I was given room 537A which is a corner room with great views of The Hudson River and Statue of Liberty. The room was small but it's nothing new to me and I loved that I get a little breeze coming in since it was a bit warm. You also get a view of a busy highway and can hear cars going by night and day, which is also not a problem with me since I'm not a light sleeper. What I have a problem with on this trip however is the cleanliness of my room and the shared bathrooms down the hall. To be fair, this is my second time at The Jane, so what I had encountered here are nothing new. My room gets a lot of visits from pigeons and they do a lot of things by my window. They eat, sleep and of course relieved themselves.",1,1
"I stayed here in September 2011 having read good reviews on here. I have to say, I was disappointed, The rooms are tiny, with a small bed (not good for tall people), and whilst the bathrooms are clean with decent facilities, they are shared between quite a few people. This hotel does, however have some redeeming features, such as the efficiency and helpfulness of the staff, the cleanlyness of the place and the history associated with it. However for the money you pay, you can do a lot better elsewhere. On a side issue (and not directly related to the hotel) whilst the West Village/Chelsea is great to visit, I would not advise staying there for too long as the 'poncyness' of the whole place will get to you. For something a bit more genuine and relaxed try the lower East side,",2,1

The thing that is unacceptable is when arriving back from a evening out I noticed the Jane Ballroom was open and thought I would check it out and maybe grab a night cap before bed. I walked up and I see them letting in several other people into the lounge and when I attempted to enter series of rude people running the door and a particularly rude tall woman said the lounge was closed for a ""private event"".  No sign, no ""list"" nothing... I indicated I was a hotel guest but all that got was rolling eyes. Based on that treatment and the overall disregard for their guests I recommend not staying here, ever! I certainly wont and I travel to NYC over 30 times a year.  I'll go",1,1
When calling down to reception to report that I ben bitten by bed bugs the front desk staff showed no surprise.  They even had a box of after bite right behind them in a draw.

"I highly suggest looking up the bed bug registry and seeing how many problems The Jane has with bed bugs.  The fourth floor seems especially infested.  I stayed at The Jane one night although I had reservations for 3 nights.  I was in a single room with shared bathroom and thought 99 dollars a night for NYC was a steal . My room was the size of a closet and  I had a very uncomfortable sleep because the bed was much smaller than a twin, it was more like a cot.  It was a futon type small cot but I am not a huge person so I thought it would be fine.  First of all, if you are claustrophobic, DO NOT stay at the Jane.  Secondly if you are tall or bigger this bed will never be big enough for you.  It was a very hot July night and I turned on the air conditioner, it was unbelievably",1,1

Not all rooms are hotel rooms apparently, some are residential and te one across from me had his/her door always ajar - odd but not creepy. Bath rooms were always available, no waiting, but toilets were not always clean; great showers. Wifi was Winky on my iPad, worked well on my iPhone. Just a few easy blocks to 14th Street Subway. Odd to use the key chain to power the room, but effective.",2,1

I loved the Bowery and also the Maritime and I was excited to stay here.   I stayed in a Captain's room.   It was a profound disappointment.   There were quite a few things I didn't like: - The window to the room are prison sized - The mattress is uncomfortable - The power off thing makes it very uncomfortable in the room on a hot day. - The housekeeping staff gave me 2 shampoos but no shower gel.  When I asked for that to be fixed I was brought up 2 conditioners.  okay.... - The TV signal seemed really off.  Not that I spend much time watching TV in NY but it was kind of annoying.   - The bar downstairs was 'closed for a private party'.  Apparently this happens often.    Also there aren't always cabs outside as the hotel is pretty out of the way.,2,1

We complained on 5 occasions but alas this made no difference. In the morning we found cockroaches in our room.  The bathrooms were clean, but after several showers in the morning, the floor was flooded and covered in bits of hair. We were offered 20% discount, but after some pressure had a complete refund.

There's no way to adjust the room temperature manually other than opening the window or turning on the fan.    - People next door tend to leave their TV on until 4 or 5 in the morning. You absolutely need ear plugs to be able to sleep.   - There is no hair dryer in the room. Only shared bathrooms have hair-dryers. Other hotels with shared bathrooms include a hair-dryer in every room.  - There is no sink in the room. You have to go brush your teeth in the shared bathroom.

Lastly, bad soundproof, super noisy. However, the facilities are good : ipod player, free wifi (that works very well) and nice restaurant.

Their elevators were out for repairs so we had to carry our bags up the stairs and one of the men that worked there actually broke my collegue's bag. Then we get into our room the bunk bed room, which we knew was small but it was just too tiny for 2 people, but the worst part was the smell that was in the hotel, it was just unbearable and hard to describe.  Due to the small room and the fact that we were going to be there for a week we decided to upgrade to the Captain's Cabin, which still was smaller than a normal size hotel room.  To be honest, to some this hotel was probably ok for them, for us it",1,1

I was told that the club closed at 4am so the noise wouldn't be a problem after that.... fantastic. So the noise is only until 4am.... they should have said earlier and I would have waited to go to sleep!!!

First the pluses:  Even though it's not really in the meatpacking district, you're just a couple blocks walk so you might as well be.  The staff was very nice and really seemed to be trying hard, which had to be tough given what they have to work with.  The food at the cafe was also very good.

My first room was on a low floor and close to the nightclub below which I could hear pretty clearly until 3am on a midweek night. After complaining, I was moved to a higher room with a tiny window and very noisy AC. So basically, I couldn't get a good night's sleep. The hotel is quirky, but in my opinion very shabby/dirty, the staff are fine, but well below par for NYC. For the same money, and a little haggling, you can stay at the Soho Grand, which is a treat.",2,1
I recently stayed at the Jane Hotel 9/19-9/23. I got bed bugs. In fact they traveled all the way to Seattle with me and I still am having issues with ridding my apartment/life of them.

The night we spent there was average, the rooms are tiny, but seemed clean, the building is amazing. Hind site is 20/20. As we were packing up to leave I had noticed several tiny blood spots on my sheets, didn't really give it much thought assuming I had cut my arm before heading to bed. Now I know that this is a tale tell sign of a bed bug infestation and the reason I know is because we carried these awful creatures home with us from the hotel. As I did more research I found that The Jane has had issues for over a year and is on the Bed Bug Registry with several complaints one dating within days of when my husband and I were there. I was totally grossed out and completely appalled",1,1

I'd like to check out immediately, but the earliest train to my destination on Long Island doesn't leave until 7:30 a.m. I had been planning on a leisurely morning in the city and the noon train.

I wanted to love the Jane. Great location. So tastily decorated. Cool. People that work there nice. Not too expensive by New York standards.  I could even tolerate the tiny rooms because they are so beautifully done but...the airconditioner in my room was so loud and sounded like a 747. It was hot in the city but even hotter in the hotel. The hallways were smelly and humid. When I arrived in my room it was dreadfully hot. You have to insert your key into the wall to turn on the aircon. It took well over an hour for it to be inhabitable. What they don't tell you is there are tenants living in the hotel building so even if you can stand the noise of your aircon in your tiny room...you may not be able to stand the smell of cigarette smoke which wafts into the room from it.

"Whatever your thoughts on The Jane Hotel, you are bound to remember it.  And actually, there is much to recommend the hotel.  But still, it may not be for you—given tiny rooms and shared baths.  The location is central, convenient, and wonderful on many levels—Jane Street near the Hudson River—as it puts guests in the heart of the West Village, and near the parks that line the river.  The now-trendy Meatpacking District is just a few blocks away, the south entrance of the High Line park is close at hand, and the tree-lined residential streets in this part of the Village surround the hotel.  The streets appear to be as safe as any in NYC--expensive cars are parked outside, and people stroll at all hours.  We were in town for NYC Pride, and Christopher Street is about 10 minutes",2,1
"For the rate of $117 per weekend nite, it was way overpriced!  The room was the size of a storage closet with a bed that was smaller than a twin bed.  Moreover, the bed was not comfortable at it: the mattress about  4 inches high and is  filled with foam and is placed on top of a wooden frame.  Moreover, the staff is very unfriendly.  Furthermore, when I asked for a late check out of only 30 minutes more, they said that it wasn't possible and I had to check out at 12 noon on a monday.  When I did check out at 12 noon, I saw at least 20 rooms that were available at the front desk (the room keys are stored in room boxes behind the check-in desk), so it wasn't as if the hotel needed my room immediately!    You are better off staying at a hotel outside of Manhattan that is right by",1,1
"This review is for Le Gitane restaurant, the bistro which is part of The Jane hotel in Manhattan.  We booked a table for 10 on a Friday night and were escorted to a table that could hardly fit 8. As it was obvious there was no alternative, we decided to move in a give it a go. The service was unbelievably bad with an ignorant waitress who clearly did not feel like working that night. if you like bread, Le Gitane is the place to be. I don't think we came across a single starter that did not come with bread or was a version of a bread dish.  We tasted a Pinot Girs, but did not like it, so the waitress took the bottle away and presented us with a second one. This tasted very different and it turned out that she had decided that maybe a Bordeaux would be a better choice (how about",2,1
"Where do I begin?  OK, location is very inconvenient.  The west village is so beatutiful, true, but the hotel is all the way over at the west side hwy.  If the weather is not beautiful, you're going to spend a fortune on taxis, which are scarce.  If you have great weather, its at least a 20-30 minute walk to Soho, the Village, etc. So, you really don't have a good ""base"" during your trip.  Next, the staff - generally ok, but not at all polished.  I hate those weird monkey suits they all wear.  The rooms (I had a deluxe with privte bathrm) are small, which is ok, but lets just say weirdly furnished with tiny little $100 window AC units that are noisy. The bathroom amentities are not graciously replenished or replenished at all for that matter.  The cafe staff is nice and",1,1
"It is tiny, but no rats. Good value, but expect a snooty attitude from the staff.  Just got hassled by the doorman as I entered the place, and was refused service earlier for something that was supposed to be included, for no good reason. Weird. Almost thinks its cooler than it is.  Can't open window for smell of pee.",2,1
"‎ I don't think I would ever stay here again. Yes, the price is right, but the bunk bed rooms are smaller than what I'd imagine a jail cell to be, the cigarette smoke from other guests could be smelled in our ""room,"" and our neighbor was a creepy full-time resident who stayed up past 3 am watching tv. Also, sharing a bathroom, especially w/ full-timers, is kind of anxiety-inducing. This place is too pretentious, too, and full of wannabe hipsters, which is too bad, because the cafe is lovely, and makes you feel like you are traveling elsewhere in the world, very far away. They need to knock some walls down and add some bathrooms to start to live up to their cachet. Also, I felt itchy in the bed. I'm just sayin'.",2,1
"I was staying in NYC for only one night and wanted to avoid paying $300+ for a hotel room downtown.  Well, you get what you pay for.  The website made the Jane look like a chic boutique hotel with fancy amenities and small rooms.  What they don't tell you is that there are many residents still living there from the building's days as an SRO (rooming house for the poor).  I had no idea to expect this, as the website neglected to mention this.  Needless to say, there were many unsavory people roaming the halls, and when i arrived back at the hotel at 12:30am the front desk was empty.  This made me feel quite unsafe.  The ""communal"" bathroom is also CO-ED, so when you step out of the shower in a very small bathrobe, you don't know who might be standing there.  and the shower was",1,1
"My wife and I - mid 30's - stayed in a bunk bed room at the Jane while we had a two day layover in NY. After booking I read some of the reviews on this site and I told my wife, ""lower your expectations; maybe it's not as good as it seems on the web site.""   However, I can report that our stay was great, we really liked the Jane. It was clean, even the shared bathrooms. My wife is a clean freak, and even she said it was very clean.  Yes, the room is SUPER small, but for that price what do you expect? The room is a place to sleep, not lounge around in all day on a honeymoon! We didn't find any ""bedbugs"" at all, like a previous reviewer said. The staff was quite friendly and helpful in every way.  We have zero complaints from our stay. In fact, it will be my hotel of choice when",1,1
"I don't mind tiny rooms or surly front desk people, but the bathrooms are wide open, with 2-3 sinks right next to each other and toilets and shower doors opening in to the same common space.  Also, I now have mysterious bites on me that appeared the next day.  After checking on line, I am pretty sure that they are bed bug bites.",2,1
"The Jane is very cheap- no doubt about that.  Location is good, lobby and bar are cute.  That's where the positive aspects end.    Stayed in a room with bunk beds and tiny doesn't even begin to describe the space.  It was about 4x9 and my friend and I could hardly be in the room at the same time except to sleep.  What little room there is happens to be very well designed.  Don't ask me how they got the bunk beds in there.  There are shared bathrooms, which is fine if you don't mind that kind of thing.  However, there are still semi-homeless people living there and the conversion from a single occupancy hotel (SRO) is still underway.    For the price, there really are other options.  Got a room for $99 at the Ace Hotel (nice beds, private bath and 6x the size) after one night at",1,1
"Besides the fact that hotel is still being renovated and is basically a hyped-up dump,  the staff is made up of actor wanna-bees that feel they're doing you a favor by granting you permission to spend your money at their hotel.  Upon checking out, one female staffer is standing at the front desk complaining because a few ""guests"" or should I say victims, wanted a late check out.  She is telling her fellow staffers that she's going to throw them out if they don't get out by 12:00PM.  The bar/lounge is apparently very popular.  It must be why the bar manager thinks Barack Obama reports to him.  Dude, you run a bar, get over it.

"We stayed at the Jane due to its cheap price and its location (which are its positives).  However, the negatives far outweigh the positives.  For example, the rooms are very, very small. There is barely enough space for one person to change.  There is simply not enough space for two people to change....one will have to leave the room for the other to change.  The hotel also smells....there is a nasty odor that permeated the halls and rooms.  There are local residents that stay in the hotel, and yes, they are strange.  The worst part of the hotel is the shower.  During our stay, the shower stalls in both bathrooms on the floor were flooded (the drains did not drain the water).  You can only imagine how gross this would be to step into and shower.  There are much better values for",1,1
"Hi, I went to the Jane in December. The rooms are small, if you get a bunkbed cabin! You can't get dressed together cause there is no room! The beds are really hard, you can feel the wiress through the matrass. The residents that live there smell really bad and are not friendly.  The staff at Cafe Gitane are rude, they keep asking if your done eating when clearly you are not!. And when you give them a tip, they come back for more money..  In short, if you have MORE money, don't go to the Jane!  Regards, Caroline",2,1
"As we were desperately looking for a low budget hotel in New York for September 2009, a New York friend told us about The Jane. It sounded too good to be true; a fair price hotel in the West Village, recently opened and nice looking but small rooms.   We were able to book a ‘cabin’ for two persons for 2 weeks.  Arriving at the hotel and seeing our home / cabin for the next two weeks we had the attitude of the positive, still. Okay, it was a very small room with a view on a blind wall and that airco outside was making a lot of noise, but, hey we were in New York. The first night we were completely wasted from the flight from Amsterdam to New York and slept quite early. We woke up in the middle of the night because of the noise coming out of the bar of the hotel downstairs: music,",2,1
"Im really disappointed with Jane. OK, its great location and its really cheap for single travelers, but nothing else. I read in some flight magazine that Jane is really hot spot in NY. It was quite a few of us traveling, only us two a couple so it sounded like a good choice. Unfortunately it was quite cold with Hudson wind, and all double rooms are on that side. With really bad windows and hardly any heating it was just freezing, but not cold, really freezing. After bloking window with all towels and asking for more blankets we slept in all our clothes. All the single rooms were like sauna on the other hand... Unfortunately the stuff didnt meet expectation during the fight with cold...  And the rooms are smelly.  Ok its cheap but you can find a better double for this price.",2,1
It is quite interesting and has some advantages for the price. There are a lot of things to improve ............................,2,1
"I recently stayed at this hotel with a friend of mine, date of check-in was 9.9.09 - separate rooms.  It started out just fine until we tried to sleep after both having very long flights.  The newly opened hotel bar really should be called a club AND it really should not be in this hotel.  It kept both of us awake at all hours of the night.  Remember that NYC bars don't shut down until about 4am.  When we complained to the front desk, he tried to give us the excuse that all the rooms are soundproof.  Nice try, but I don't think so.  The bags under my eyes are proof.  My friend has her own handful of complaints with this place - they didn't stock her room with clean towels and they didn't clean her room until we specifically asked and requested them to do so.  This is probably",1,1
"I'll start with the positives:  Staff is extremely friendly and will go out of their way to make your experience comfortable. As soon as we arrived, we were early for check-in and they were willing to store out bags for free until our check-in time of 3:00pm. The Lobby is extremely nice with a bar that seems to attract a huge line every night.   The rooms were clean with an LCD screen on both the top and bottom bunk. Every room comes with AC, an IPOD dock. Although the rooms were extremely small, it provides a nice and safe place to crash ( who would want to stay in their hotel room when they are in NY).   Bathrooms were also surprisingly clean. The cleaners do a good job in that regard.  Location is also very convenient, only a few blocks from the nearest subway station and",2,1
"Beware! The Jane Hotel has a bed bug problem. I was attacked on my first night - the front desk clerk moved me to another room straight away, and seemed to be quite rehearsed in the experience. The new room had a worse infestation! I spent the night in terror and demanded to speak with a manager in the morning. ""There is no management on duty!"" is what the response was.  I asked what would happen in the event of an emergency, and the clerk said he would try to phone the manager to come in. The desk agent tried phoning someone, but ""she was not available"". I checked out and stayed somewhere else in Manhattan.  The building has a popular, hip nightclub and the lobby and rooms have a smart design and cheap rooms. It seemed too good to be true, and it was! Do not stay here!",1,1
"Was excited to stay at the Jane Hotel. Heard really good things and was pleased with the room, but was awoken in the middle of the night only to find that I was being eaten alive by BEDBUGS!!!!!   I was so disgusted, I left my room at 4 am and Jane Hotel staff did not do ANYTHING to help the situation. I was not offered an alternate room (it would probably be infested with bedbugs as well) or compensation. I spent the rest of the evening/early morning waiting in the neighbourhood starbucks.  NEVER AGAIN. Completely traumatised.",2,1
"My bad.  I should have read all of the reviews.  Particularly the ones that warned of odor.  I was prepared for a 50 square foot room and even prepared for the bath down the hall.  I was not prepared for the dingy condition of the room, the hallway and the distinct odor of the bathroom.  Depressing and sad.",1,1
Literally the worst service I have ever had.  Nothing personal.  Just horrible service.  MODELS W NO SERVICE EXPERIENCE.,1,1
"This isn't a hotel.   It's ""Cabin style"" rooms are barely workable. Basically one uncomfortable single bed,  with 2 very slim sheets that don't keep anything warm. The room was very very dark, and quite cold at night.  This isn't ""trendy"" or ""hip"", it's just horrible. Unless I missed something and  it's now trendy to not be able to turn around in your hotel room, and shivering suddenly cool.   I've stayed in Youth Hostels that are miles better than this. At $80 a night, it's just not worth it.   It's also clear that this used to house homeless people on long term live-ins. They're constantly walking around. I'm not scared of homeless people (I used to live in San Fran), but if that's not your thing, you may want to reconsider.   One notable plus point, every staff member was",1,1
"Please be warned: the Jane is in in the process of converting from a NYC rooming house into a hotel.  While I was there, all of my fellow residents were actual residents.  Late night coming and going, folks hanging out in the hall, as well as personal possessions.  Had to walk around guys on ladders, guys carrying bags of trash, plaster, etc.  Elevator out of order.  Restaurant on the first floor not in existence yet, still under construction.  When this is all done, it'll look great and will be a cheap alternative for folks who don't mind sharing a bathroom with the whole floor but right now, not ready, still a rooming house.  Rooms are truly tiny tiny but that was expected (barely bigger than the bed).  I was surprised that its marketed as a hotel at the present.",1,1
"Saw online reviews, thought it would be nice, so booked a stay for 6 nights.   Was put into a room which was so small, and worse than a 1-star motel and everything in the rooms is 20 years old.   Reasons for checking out of the hotel - Hotel is Dirty  Hallways are filthy and smell of smoke Rooms are cramped up and too small and no where same as pictured  Everything is old and musty.  My wifes allergies started to act up.  Feels as if we were scammed as we were showed great pictures and hotel was too shabby. No coffee machine  Couldnt spend any more time there and immediately checked out next morning on 29th Jan.   I talked to the hotel manager and we were not offered any other room and were told you booked the cheapest room in our hotel, so this is what you get.  Politely asked",1,1
I stayed at the the hotel overall the stay was good wa surpised there was drink making factiles in the room or bottle water. On arrival I was informed that I needed to leave $300 (£230) deposit which I was not made aware of before hand however I was not in position to argue the toss and was informed it was a refundable deposit. I thought this would be return on departure I checked out two weeks ago and still no sign of the deposit being return. It concerns me that they have not returned it. I was a solo traveler who left the room as I found it.,2,1
"We have just retuned from a New York break, 5 nights staying at the New Yorker hotel on 8th Avenue. This is advertised as a 4-star hotel, which it is not, I’ve stayed at better 2-star hotels. It’s really tired and shabby with tape covering the frayed edges of carpet in the communal areas.  If you are staying on 21st floor and above you may wait up to 20 minutes for an elevator as they are not always working. The windows in the rooms do not fit the frame so the wind howls like a gale through the windows, making the rooms extremely cold. We had to keep the curtains closed the whole time to stop the freezing draft.  The receptionists are not very helpful, when we arrived, we explained that we had paid for bed and breakfast and were advised by the receptionist that breakfast was",2,1
"This is my 4th visit to New York but first time in this hotel, In a good location, Just a few things put me off to a point I won’t be returning. We were being checked in by Mohammed who asked us to leave him a review, then said he’d waived all the fees of an early check and room with a view (we didn’t ask for either) he must have asked us to leave him a review about 7/8 times. We then got into our room with the phone ringing - its Mohammed reminding us to leave him a review (No joke!) it’s not want you want or need after a 12hr travel day. The rooms are quite small but considering you’re only sleeping in them it’s not a big deal however they do need a deep clean. The curtains/nets were covered in thick dust and fluff. The lifts are very slow so make sure you don’t need to rush",2,1
"We stayed in the New Yorker over Christmas. Our room was extremely dated as was the rest of the hotel. We expected a small room but perhaps not as small as we got. We couldn’t even open our suitcases on the floor.   I aren’t sure if the rooms get nicer as you go up but we were first given a room on the 19th floor but before we went up we asked if there was any any lower down. We were given one on the 13th floor. If this is the case, it would have been nice for the receptionist to say yes there is but the room isn’t the same quality.  The staff who stood at the bottom of the lifts to ensure that you could only get in with a room key never said hello\good morning.   The location of the hotel is perfect for seeing the sights of New York.",2,1
"We were allocated this Hotel as a part of our group package and it appeared to be a good deal as the daily fee they charge to use the fitness centre and have free telephone and wi-fi was waivered. The location is superb right where you want to be to explore wonderful NYC, close to subway, manhatten, empire state building etc. First impressions are good also, as the foyer, bar and reception are all art-deco clean tidy and the staff are very engaging, polite and helpful. The tick tock 24 hour diner attached to the Hotel serves great food and the eggs benedict is out of this world. 10/10 thus far. Our booking stated we was in a standard queen room and when we arrived reception informed us that we had been allocated a room without a view and he would upgrade us to a room with a view",2,1
Overall I enjoyed my experience but the ending soured it for me.    Being told it’s $15 to leave my bags downstairs for half an hour while I ran an errand before going to airport ruined my experience.  The cheap comes out expensive.    I would have been happy to til the attendant $5 but paying $15 is insulting to me as a guest who stayed here for 3 nights.and needed to leave my bags for 30 minutes.    Been travelling for a long time.  Never was extorted money to leave my bags for a short period of time.   Not cool.  At all.  Bad form.  Bad customer service.  The baggage attendant wasn’t exactly nice.  And the hotel clerk didn’t seem one iota interested in my plight. Or in helping me.,1,1
"Horrible experience at the New Yorker.   We had to charge one of our phones in the bathroom, not to mention the fire hazard plug socket behind the bed!!   Room was tiny, our luggage took up most of it! We couldn’t move around much in the bathroom at all. Room was very dated and dirty (marks on the headboard which was very off putting!) - the walls were so thin all we heard was walking about in the hallway all night, alongside our neighbours being noisy…. VERY thin walls!!!! Awful night sleep.   We got there about 11pm at night due to a late flight, stayed one night and left a day before we were due to because of the sheer state of our room.

The room was the smallest room I have ever experienced in NYC, bathroom that has not been updated in 30 years (original shower hardware) and the bathroom was so small that it was uncomfortable. Front desk staff were extremely nice and location was good but the hotel is truly taking advantage of people and it is certainly not a 4 star hotel with rooms like we had.",2,1

I know when we booked it months ago and the rate was fairly cheap for December in NYC that it would not be great but I was even more disappointed than I was expecting.  The rooms were small and dirty.  The bathroom was not clean, rust in the tub and dirty. Our toilet got clogged the 2nd night and took an hour to get someone up to fix it.  On the last day we had a charge to the restaurant downstairs that  was not ours.  We got the run around trying to get it reimbursed.  The hotel management would not take responsibility for it and told us to find the managers of the restaurant and they did not help us.  We had to leave for the airport before they could resolve it and I am sure we won’t get it back. Very disappointing!  We will not",1,1

Staff unfriendly, elevators an absolutely nightmare. 20 mins to wait for one as only 3 out of 6 or 7 were working. No signs to say some were not working and I was there for a full week. Had to take the staff elevator or take the stairs as there were no covid restrictions. Staff too bothered about showing your hotel card to get to the elevator then to be helpful of any kind. Tick tock diner was a nightmare in the end. Ignorant rude staff. I was thrown a check at me and told to pay at the counter which is absolutely not protocol.

"Spent a week at this hotel and was really disappointed so much so one of the first things I did was to email the manager but not even had an acknowledgment from her.  I also completed the online survey early yesterday.     Anyway, here is my honest review.  We arrived early, as our original flights had been cancelled, when I say early it was a maximum of two hours earlier than we would have got our rooms.   I had asked for two rooms together via email before we left the Uk and was told they would try and arrange it.  We arrived only to find nothing had been done about my request.

My family of 4 booked a 2 queen family terrace suite. While the view from the terrace is stunning our actually family suite is 290 sq Ft while the description states varies between 420 and 460. The front desk knows they have to soften the blow of “yes we know but your view is the best” I know some of the reviews state that they have been given different rooms that are bigger so I know they have different size rooms available in the same room category. I get that this hotel is old but how about being honest. Biggest pet peeve of mine. Offer discounts for the smaller rooms. I paid a premium for this room for my family. My husband and sons birthday celebration on the nice room was a bust. We have 3 more nights of sleeping in this tiny room. Incredibly disappointed.   The lady that,1,1
The rude staff was awful. Nobody could even use a kind tone. They were short and spoke to adults as though they are children and nobody smiled. They could not be bothered. The place was dingy and the area wasn’t so much desirable. We won’t come back to this hotel.,1,1
If you’re booking this hotel through a third party such as Expedia/Priceline expect hidden fees to be added. I was told I had to pay $100 a night at check in on top of the amount I already paid. Very frustrating as I had bags and wasn’t easily able to switch hotels at that point. The rooms are small and outdated and unappealing. I ended up checking out early to move to another hotel.,1,1
"The use of masks was not mandatory when I stayed there.  That was terrible. I always had my mask on, but not all guest did because no one at the hotel enforced that. As a matter of fact, the staff mentioned that wearing masks was optional. Plus, they never asked to see proof of guests vaccination.  I also had a surprise ""cleaning fee"" charged to my account and not a single answer, proof or evidence of what this was for.  My room was clean and I didn't leave any mess nor did anything inappropriate in my room,  so for me this was outrageous.

It's impossible to call the hotel because no one EVER answers and Secondly I had to do an international call almost everyday from my end just to get in touch with Wyndham.

"This Blast-from-the-Past ""4-star"" hotel across from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden provided a stunning view of the Empire State Building and plenty of hot water, but in other respects was lacking: 1. 40-minute check-in. 2. 40 more minutes to buy an extra night. 3. Bed made but sheets not changed. 4. Room not cleaned, garbage not emptied. 5. 30-second minimum wait before elevator doors close. 6. 30-second ""temperature"" screening and mugshot every time you enter. 7. Desk clerk insists you confirm purchase by entering PIN number, but refuses to show you bill on screen or on paper--or even give you receipt for your payment. (!!)  The list goes on . . .",1,1
"The rooms are too small and very uncomfortable, you can barely move around in them. The bathroom ceiling leaked, and it creeped me out. Most of the staff was rude. This was the worse hotel experience I ever had!!!",1,1
"After booking thru a site with “non refundable” charges, what are you supposed to do when you’re hit with a “cleaning fee” basically doubling the cost of the room.  This is one of the dirtiest scumiest things I’ve ever encountered.   Stay away. If you think you’re getting a good deal, you’re not.",1,1
"During the reservation process I was told that the AAA rate was better than the military and that it even included parking and breakfast (which was too good to be true in NYC); none of the three things proved to be true and accurate. During the checkout I told the frontdesk that I felt tricked about the rate (AAA vs. Military - being active duty myself) and the rude response from the lady was to call the accounting department and complaint to them, without giving me any real solution...  I had a problem with the bathroom, the toilet was DIRTY outside from previous owners (not going to what was on it) and even though I informed immediately to the frontdesk, it took more that 24 hours and a second complaint to clean the bathroom. If that is with the regular cleaning, I could not",1,1
"Myself and my partner had booked our holiday to NYC through a travel agents so we didn’t have much choice as far as hotels went. We arrived at the New Yorker and immediately were told we had to pay a $250 fee as “insurance” which was the first red flag, I was aware that there are city taxes etc but when booking I had asked my travel agent to find out was there any other fees and they had told me there were not going to be. After reluctantly paying the $250 we then went up to our room which was probably one of the smallest hotels rooms I’ve ever been in ( I was expecting small but not this small and especially for the price) and our view was facing another wall! We were also told that our price included breakfast which turned out to only be a pastry and coffee each morning. I’m",2,1
"Overall nice place. We were expecting a luxury  hotel based on photos price and review but it was pretty average. Dated rooms and amenities. The security guard is super judgmental too, he stopped me like five times and told me that I was not staying in the hotel and nobody was even occupying a room on my floor!?!!?",1,1
"small rooms and upon looking over the room a huge cockroach flew out of the bathroom. I didn't want to go downstairs empty handed so I attempted to find it by looking under the curtains and saw a previous guests toothbrush. Went back downstairs and was given another room. Needless to say I didn't sleep much that night and left very early the next morning. They're currently checking the temperature of all visitors to before entering. This is known useless, I wouldn't be surprised if some higher-ups cousin sold them those things. I suppose they may turn away 1 or 2 people over the pandemic, but a temperature check doesn't catch the people who are asymptomatic or are building up. I guess it's pandemic theater and thank you for wasting my time waiting in line EVERY TIME I went back",2,1
"During this pandemic, I had to go to new york and I decided to stay at the new yorker hotel. Everything it's very disturbing with the pandemic situation that the last thing that you need is that the employees of the hotel treat you badly.  I got the worst experience ever with a lady working at night time as a security and taking your temperature every time that you go in and out of the hotel. very annoying. she wasn't nice or kind. she treated me badly, she was very mean. There is another guy that works at night, Asian. He wasn't professional at all. Neither of them was.  they shouldn't treat clients badly.  I won't ever come back and I DO NOT recommend this hotel at all. plus, in these pandemic times.",1,1
"We booked the New Yorker and weren’t greeted when we arrived. We were confronted to stand and take a photo for a temperature check without any explanation or at least a “Welcome to the New Yorker, please stand here for your temper check.” The staff in general were dismissive, dry, and it felt like we were intruding on their space. We booked a stay at Arlo Soho for the remainder of our trip because we refuse to pay for services that are subpar. The best part of the NewYorker was exiting with our luggage in hand and 3 staff members watching us leave without even saying thank you for coming. We’ve never experienced hotel service as such. We just checked in to Arlo Soho and the experience was night and day, as it should be. However, I appreciate the clean room and hot shower.",2,1
"The hotel is in a great location. The hotel is outdated and desperately needs renovation. Rooms are pretty small, showers are from 1930. Very authentic, but not in a good way. Way too expensive for what you get.",2,1
"Hotel looks posh.  Room small but adequate and dated (plumbing ancient!) What REALLY annoyed us was they quote a low price to get to the top of search engines then add a COMPULSORY ""facilities charge"" of over $40!! We were not able to use any of the facilities due to our short stay.  This is ILLEGAL in the UK.  You have to advertise the price customers actually pay.  A shame the US hasn't caught up with modern consumer protection.",2,1
"Me and my partner visited this hotel Dec 2019 was the most perfect holiday and perfect location and hotel was ok! Never had problems when I was there...however, when I arrived on check inn I was told I had to pay $150 which was £121.59 English money for a security deposit (if I broke anything or smoked in the room etc) which I didn’t and on check out I was told the money had been refunded back into my account and I would get it within 5-10 days. Which was fine!! Until it gets to March 2020 and I still haven’t received my money. First I contacted my bank in the middle of January, they told me to contact the hotel so they put me through to the head office at the New Yorker hotels. After being on the phone for 40 minutes and no luck I was told the only way to contact the employees",2,1
"This Hotel is extremely over due for a renovation. To be located right on 34th street in NYC this hotel is very old and dirty. The hallway and room smell like a football team lockerroom. The room carpets are not  kept. Found another person hair on the ""clean towels"" and toilet looks like it has't been cleaned in days. But is not actually that is dirty is that it's old and stained and full of splashes from God knows what. This place is very disappointing.  I asked for a room upgrade and I was willing to pay for it. I was advised they have nothing available.",1,1
After travelling for 24 hours with my family including 2 children. When we arrived at hotel we were told they didn’t have the room we booked available and that they could put us in a room with 1 bed and 2 roll up beds. We didn’t have much choice as it was 10pm. As we went into the room there was literally no space to put the roll up beds (if we could have put beds up it would have 100% blocked the door- causing a fire risk) I went back down to reception to explain there is no room to put up the beds. The hotel staff did not show any empathy and stood in silence shrugging their shoulders. Eventually they found us another room for the night but still roll up beds for the kids. As an apology the staff offered us not to pay the service charge for our stay.  We were told to check out,1,1
"I proceeded to book this hotel having seen many positive reviews, and giving it the benefit of the doubt.   During our stay the Westminster Kennel Club dog show meant that the hotel was packed full of dogs - whilst that was no problem for us, it might have been somewhat different with allergies.   The hotel lobby gives an impression of the grandeur that once was - unfortunately, the luxury ends there.   As mentioned in other reviews, the lift situation is awful - although they are supposed to be replaced next month, we found we needed to leave an extra ten minutes when we left our room to ensure we weren’t late. Only two of the eight lifts for the hotel floors were operational during our stay.   The room itself was fine but extremely dated - this is particularly noticeable in",2,1
"Offered room upgrade by email  with pictures of newly renovated ,city view ,larger room with two queen beds . Arrived received dark dingy small room with double beds and a view of the alley. When I complained to manager he said they had no queen sized beds in the hotel only double or kings and the upgrade we were offered didn’t exist. We could barely fit the dog kennel (there for Westminster) between the beds.  By decor hadn’t been renovated since the seventies.",2,1
This is my 2nd visit and my last. The hotel is dated and no work has been done on it since my last visit 5 years ago. There is a 15 minute wait to even use the elevators. The room was cold and really dated. Staff at reception were not the friendliest. The shower had 2 settings scalding hot or cold. They need to invest more money in this hotel or reduce prices to stay there. Only positive was the location which was the only reason I went back but I will find a different hotel next time.  They also charge you to store your bags for 1hr.,1,1
"I recently stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and would never stay there again due to the standard of the bedrooms and the situation of the hotel. The rooms are very very dated and seem as if they have not been updated since the 1980’s. The corridors are very shabby. The area in which the hotel is situated is run down and not an area you want to be walking around on your own at night time. The positives about the hotel are the staff, every member of staff was helpful, friendly and went out of their way to assist you. This is definitely not a 4 star hotel.",1,1
"The hotel was situated right on 34th and 8th street brilliant location , easy access to all the shops and underground transport , we were so excited when we arrived the outside looked amazing so did the reception,  look can be deceiving tho it was a total let down  ,15 mins waiting for a lift as only 2 lifts working out of 6 which are always full , once you get off the lift your opinion will change , the hotel is out dated , we booked a queen room with extra breakfast , the room was small and cold , no rads in the room only a heater on the ceiling , lithe heater would dry your throat out so ud have to put on the cold to cool down the room as there are no windows working ,the bath had brown stains on it and the outside had black mould on the edges other then that the room was",2,1
"I returned yesterday from a break with my daughter and mother and unfortunately stayed here. At the front door they have 2 security guards, one on an external door and one on an internal door, with a space in the middle.  They have a system with people queuing to get in/out. There was a revolving door, but of course that was out of order. The lady at check in was impersonal to the point of rudeness.  She typed stuff into the computer and said, ""credit card"". I asked how much security was to be taken and she said 4 nights, $140.  I felt as though I shouldn't have asked her. We waited for around 15 mins for an escalator as only half worked. They said they are due to refurbish them sometime never. We were in one room, two queen sized beds.  I know New York rooms are small but this",1,1

Becareful what rooms you book here !!   We asked to move rooms which we had to pay for an “upgrade “ additional price per night we had no choice as the original room was disgraceful.   The hotel is so very very busy !! There was an issue with the lifts so the wait time was considerable to cope with the many many visitors and this was quiet season. We had a letter saying there is an upgrade due in March on the lifts. No compensation was made for this .   The place is in need of a refurb.

"This was my 2nd stay at the New Yorker within 12 months. My first visit was fairly pleasant in December 2018, I was checked in by the manager at the time, who without asking reduced the facilities fee to $15 per night, as I was staying for 7+ nights which was a very well received gesture, however, the room I stayed in was not up to standard. Cold with an unreliable shower, dirty carpet and unpredictable aircon/heating but as this was my first visit didn't think much of it as I spent little time in the hotel.   My second trip as of last week (Jan-Feb 2020) unfortunately will be my last. I cannot fault the lady who checked me and my partner in as she was incredible with top notch customer service, went out of her way to check us into a room on the 36th floor, with a view of",2,1

"On check in we were charged $5000 ""accidentally"" which essentially left us penniless whilst in New York. We complained to the service manager who kindly agreed to waive our resort fee. 3 days after check out this was recharged to one of our two rooms despite this verbal agreement. Her response was to deny that this was even tabled. Our family holiday will be forever tarnished with bad feelings, solely at the responsibility of Wyndham New Yorker.  The occurrence of  initial error, the behaviour of the staff member who addressed our initial concerns, the avoidance of our complaint when lodged via email and finally the deceptive way in which you applied charges well after our check- out is the reason for this.   Clearly meeting your customers basic expectations is not a priority.",1,1
"My travel agency recommended me this hotel to spend 7 days, everything went well, excellent price! until the exit happens! we stayed on the 20th Floor, and at check out they presented a bill of 270 dollars because there was a little ash in the window on the inside on the 20th floor, with a wind from the other world! the evidence they gave me was these attached photos. cheap is really expensive! escape from this hotel, at the reception everything is noted, in order to deceive the tourist. we sent for someone responsible, and a normal counter employee came, who did nothing but say that he offered to keep his bags! (pay if 5 for each bag). after 5 minutes, he said that after all we had to pay to keep it. a person in charge came who was watching everything but pretended (Kader",1,1
After having recieved the confirmation email which repeatedly stated that I had paid in full I arrived at the hotel to discover in the small print of the email was a hidden additional cost of over $30 per night. This fee covered the costs of what the initial booking had detailed as being included items for example the WiFi.   Thanks for the great welcome to NYC,1,1
"Great location. That’s about it really. Hotel upgraded us to a city view room, unfortunately between dirt and broken seals around windows the view was disappointing.  Found medication packaging behind  bin in room, a mans sock at side of bed, skirting boards window sills filthy. Sheets not ironed, curtains looked filthy. Bathroom so basic and tile ridges filthy, overall a very poor standard. Then hit with a $30 per night  tax $120 and $5 per case $25 to store luggage after checkout. Bed, toilet and bath where clean and after being travelling for  20 hours we  where just glad to get our heads down. Reception said we should of informed them on arrival, think their missing the point the room should  be cleaned properly at all times. When leaving the lift (certainly where room 3322)",1,1

"I arrived to the hotel on December 30, 2019 on December 31, 2019 the housekeeping staff was changing the rollover bed because it was damaged. When they were opening the new bed the back part on it felt on my toe resulting in an injury I reported to Michael front desk manager he introduced me to Jack manager of security he brought me some ice packs and he said to me that any medical cost the hotel wasn’t going to cover them if I wanted an EMS or some X-Rays I should pay for them. Apparently they made a report but they never provided it to me and I ask for it and they said it was confidential documents. I wasn’t able to go to the Ball Drop because of the injury, tried to walk a little bit but it was imposible to do so. I asked for a wheelchair and I could move my self a little bit",1,1
"I don't really know where to start! We have just returned from a six night stay at this hotel. From the check in process to upgrading the room the whole stay was a disaster. Virgins photographs and descriptions of the hotel are very misleading. After checking in and paying for an upgrade ($172) we made our way to a room. The lobby is the best area in the hotel. After getting out of the lift you are met with dark, dirty and dated corridors. From that moment I knew there was going to be a problem. The first room was no bigger than the bed itself. The room was absolutely filthy. After speaking to reception and changing rooms we were moved to a slightly bigger one which was a bit cleaner. However it was very dated and the bathroom is in real need of repair as the tap was constantly",1,1
"Stayed here from 28th of December until 2nd of January. Reception is lovely, security and door men are lovely and helpful. Girls at reception who I dealt with were not so friendly or helpful. Room was tiny, you will bump in to the person you are with getting from one end to the other. Very dated tired rooms. Radiator wasn’t on at all only AC. I booked a standard queen room, there was nothing queen about the small double bed. Told reception who said I got what I paid for after paying €350 a night for room only. I understand you’re in New York City but for a 4 star hotel there has to be some standards. Paid the $45 a night fee for extras. I didn’t have any extras so got a refund for this when I got home. 3 days later this refund was reverted without notifying me. So €200 taken",2,1
"What can I say, after really looking forward to my first visit to New York, this hotel was a real disappointment.   My family had just stayed in a 4 star in Washington DC, the service was perfect, the room facilities were excellent, coffee machine etc., and the room had plenty of space.   In contrast the New Yorker had very poor service, the desk couldn't get the family names correct even though they were written on the document in front of him. We were charged $20 plus 2 lots of tax per night to change one of the rooms from a double to a twin. Even though we had the rooms we booked in Washington the New Yorker was adamant we booked all double rooms and not a twin.  The room was tiny with minimal facilities, the only thing on offer was water, at a price. The lifts made so much",2,1
"Rooms are old, feels like they don't actually clean but just tighten the bed. Rooms are heated with AC so you can't sleep well. They charge extra for anything they can, saving your luggage, drinking water, packages. Old TV's with nothing to see, which can be fine if there was Netflix on the TV I would be able to access with my account, but the TV""s were to old.",1,1
"We stayed from 1 Jan to 2 Jan 2020.  NEVER EVER book this hotel. It is FULL of additional charges. The staff members and managers are rude and condescending. The customer service is terrible.  First, they hit you with a $60 AUD amenity fee for the gym and pool. Erica, the manager on duty, simply did not care if you don't use these amenities and will not waive the $60.  Secondly, this nasty hotel will you charge you $7.50 AUD per day to store each bag, if your room is not ready for check-in.  Thirdly, this greedy hotel will charge you $5.00 AUD for a 300ml bottle of water. Don't touch it, go down stairs to Walgreens and get the same bottle for $1 AUD.  Finally, this stinky hotel has not changed nor steam cleaned the carpet since it was open in the 1930s. The stench of the carpet",1,1
"I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights in December, i had called the hotel previously to my arrival to ask if i can have the two rooms i booked on the same floor, i was on the phone to them for 40 minutes as they could not locate my booking, i received my bill from my phone company and i had been charged £67 by the hotel for this call. I arrived at my hotel and was told our rooms would not be on the same floor and that if we wanted this we would have to upgrade for $125 per room this meant a better room with a view. The VIEW we had in our room was not a good view at all for an extra payment it was terrible especially compared to the room that my mum had her view was amazing. We complained and asked for a refund on the room but we were told this was not allowed so they relocated us",1,1
"Worst experience ever and would not recommend this hotel to family and friends. Had to wait a long time to check in and when I got to the front desk the receptionist was extremely rude and thought she was doing me a great favor, only to find out that the manager was cancelling reservations without informing the guests. Rooms are extremely outdated and not worth the money. Time square is also quite a distance from the hotel. Every time you enter the hotel you have to show your room card which is quite annoying. There’s many nicer hotels then the New Yorker Wyndham on the same road.",1,1
"I attempted to call the New Yorker with some questions and to hopefully make a reservation. Unfortunately the call was outsourced and I couldn't even get to the front desk. Instead, I was transferred off to some half-assed timeshare schpiel. Oh, and then a 2nd half-assed timeshare schpiel where the people on the phone tried to trick me into giving them all my info, including credit card - just so I could get a $25 gift card, wow! After trying to call and complain about this I was transferred to at LEAST 9 different #s and people none of whom could help me. I finally just got in touch with the hotel themselves, and was told to send an email. Well wouldn't you know it I never received a response to that either. Don't stay here, not that you could if you tried. Some of the most",1,1
"No heat in my daughters room even though we called and went to desk TWICE! Watch your credit/debit card accounts. This hotel put $100 on my card, $180 on my daughters card and we paid in cash. My best friend was charged $1600 twice. She got her money back in a few days but was in nyc with her money floating around in space for 3 days. They told me and my daughter our money would be refunded on our cards but that hasn’t happened!!!",1,1
"I am going to start off by stating the good things about the hotel. -The hotel’s location is fantastic. If you are staying in the city after an event at Madison Square Garden, this is steps away and is the place to stay.  -The staff is very friendly. -The hotel is very clean.   Now the bad.  -The “Facilities Fee” is obscene and misleading. To charge almost $40 a day for the use of a gym, that most people are not  going to use and along with a few other minor amenities is wrong. I expected more from a Wyndham hotel and this hotel should be ashamed of how they are ripping off their customers with this fee.  -In spite of paying the “Facilities Fee”, there wasn’t even a coffee maker in the room. Come on, even when you stay at Motel 6, there is a coffee maker in the room.  -The room",2,1
"We stayed at the New Yorker for 5 days in December. Our room was tiny, the size of a walk-in closet. The first night, we woke up at 6:30 am to two employees bickering loudly next door. The second day, we returned to the hotel at around 11:30 pm and our room smelled like cigarettes (as if someone has smoked in our room). On our last day, as I was brushing my teeth, the water from the sink came out BROWN. This is the most disgusting experience I’ve ever had at a hotel. I am very surprised this happened at a 4-star hotel.   Putting all of this aside, the room smelled bad in general, the bathroom was dirty, and the TV didn’t work properly. Safe to say I will never stay at this hotel again.",2,1
"I made a reservation for a suite at least a month in advance to have two beds in the same room but a place to get away after our 5 year old went to sleep. Instead, I was told repeatedly how much I would love the room with a queen bed in one room and a pull out sofa in the other. I didn’t love it and the room was horrible. I’ll never book here again!",1,1
"It was really disappointing. I booked two rooms for three nights and immediately want to check out after walking into the room. It was too late to cancel and I felt bad because I took my family here. 1. I was told at the front desk that there is 39 resort fee per night. When I ask what they offer out of the resort fee, they said it was actually facility fee they charge everyone including wifi and business center, fitness center etc...It felt like a random additional charge, PLUS the keys they gave me didn’t even work for the gym! (Later I have to go ask them to add it) . 2. The room was very small and old. AC was loud with some random noise if you keep it open. No coffee machine, fridge, face tissues, which you would expect from a normal hotel room. Considering this is a",2,1
"I generally don't write a bad review about any business until they cross the line..  So first impression about the hotel, I enter the lobby and there are so many people waiting there it feels like an airport, where people are just waiting with nothing to do. It's just dirty. I stand in the line for check in. It was a long 25 minute wait. my problem was that I was moving from a hotel from Long island City to the new Yorker and I just needed to keep my bags and get out because I had an event booking at 4 pm in Randall island. I came in at 1 pm since I was in the area. I asked them if I could just bring the bags and you could give me the room later, I didn't even need to see the room. But the receptionist said that they charge 5$ a bag as luggage storage fees and 50$ for early",1,1
"Stayed in many 4* hotels and this is by far the worst, and the first time I have left a less than positive review. I will start by saying the location is great, right next to Penn station.  Reception staff were nice, however only dealt with them upon check in and check out.  Beds were comfortable and the room was generally clean.  Small, cramped and outdated rooms. Tiny bathroom. For the price and also the photos online - not worth it.  The walls were also so thin we could hear everything next door.   Waiting for the lifts took forever despite there being so many of them and there was always a queue. I hated the thought of returning to the hotel to use them.  Also, one night every single lift was filled with the smell of fish, and everyone was gagging. Still no idea what it was.",2,1
"I booked my holiday direct with the Wyndham quest reservation team. Accepted I had to pay single occupancy and service charge. On arrival I was informed I had to pay $268 at the end of my stay. I pointed out already paid. Receptionist was rude and stated I hadn't. Later in my stay , I tried to discuss this issue again. Insistent I had booked through a booking agency and not guest reservations and stated I had to pay.Still wouldn't have it even with email from Wyndham quest reservation.  This made my holiday at the new yorker hotel extremely expensive.  The service charge was for wifi, use of the gym . My room was small, clean . If I wanted a kettle,  coffee machine or fridge I had to pay for them. This is the first hotel I've stayed in the United States ,where I have not had one",2,1
"We booked this hotel almost two months prior to our upcoming visit after researching hotels that could accommodate families of 5. TEN DAYS before our trip we received a message that the hotel overbooked by 200 rooms! We were given two choices: a room at a nearby hotel with two twin beds or the option to cancel without penalty and receive 25% off for a future stay at the New Yorker. We called for clarification and were told the same story. Offering two twin beds at a lower level hotel when we're a family of five?! Absurd. And what good is 25% off a future stay when we're traveling from out of state? After this fiasco, they think we'd even consider visiting their hotel? Not a chance. We travel frequently - at least once a month. We have never had this happen and can't imagine any",1,1
"This was the worst hotel I’ve stayed in in years yet one of the most expensive.  The room was run down, uncomfortable and felt overall dirty because of its state.  Even though we were on the 24th floor, the windows may have been the original and we could hear all street sounds.  The sheets were scratchy and beds felt like a brick.  I would not recommend-far better hotels in NYC for the same price.  I thought Wyndham had a standard but if this is it, I won’t stay at one again.",1,1
The location of the hotel is perfect however it ends there. We paid for a executive double with a view and were told the day before it was fine but when we arrived it was there's a burst pipe. We were given a room on the 7th floor which looks into class room/ training room. We tried to complain but got no where. The carpet was bumpy and if i was unsteady on my feet I would have tripped. The shower leaks regardless of the towels on the floor to stop the water flooding the room.  The room was a lot smaller than what we paid for.  When I returned home we emailed to complain which seems to have been ignored.,1,1
"I don’t know where those 4 and 5 stars are coming from!! Has to be paid reviews. Smdh.  I had the unfortunate experience of staying at this antiquated Hotel recently. When I arrived, there was NOBODY manning the desk and I had to call out SEVERAL times before someone came out AND with attitude.  He couldn’t find my reservation, although I had my confirmation email and said he would have to check HIS email to see and proceeded to help ANOTHER patron who was waiting in line. WTH?!!!  AFTER assisting that customer he came back to me. Checked his email and then passed me off to another coworker. Mind you his badge said manager. So now this other worker named Samira, who was UBER RUDE, was booking me in and asking if there are any rooms although I had a CONFIRMED booking.  Now whilst",1,1
We would have rated this 3 but the maid used lots of my partners Lamer cream which is rather expensive. Appalling.   Positive. Good location. Time square ten minutes walk.   The room we had was tiny. Paid $25 per night for a room with a view but the window was so filthy it kind of ruined it.   Obviously an old hotel but been refurbished. The room is okay but the bathroom is poor and very cramped.   If all you want is somewhere just to sleep it’s okay and we’ll located. Just don’t leave anything valuable in your room.,1,1
"We were upgraded to a lovely big room however this meant there were not one but 3 drafty windows.  I had the heating up to 38 degrees and was still sleeping in my socks and puffa jacket.  We paid an extra $30 ish for taxes and premium WiFi.  The WiFi was atrocious and when I called tech support I was put on hold for 15 mins so simply didn’t have the internet for my stay there.  The bathroom was tiny with another drafty window right next to the tiny shower.  Apparently women in the 30s didn’t have as many toiletries as we do.  There wasn’t even room for my toothbrush, I can’t imagine that ladies didn’t clean their teeth almost a century ago.  Don’t expect free tea and coffee facilities - that’s an extra $25 per day.  The receptionist was very pleasant when I complained but",2,1
"I emailed the Wyndham New Yorker hotel after receiving my bank statement showing that an unauthorised charge of USD 176.97 was made following my stay from 17-19 November 2019.  However, when I made this booking, I paid all the charges and hotel tax in advance. I also confirmed that no further charges would be made at check-in and when checking out, and the member of staff on duty assured me that no additional charges or resort fees would be made in connection with this booking.   Please could you reply to me regarding the money you have taken from my account in accordance with New York's Unfair Trade Practices Law. This includes a non-sterling transaction fee of £3.77, and brings the total unauthorised amount you have taken to £140.95.",1,1
"After probably hundreds of hotel stays, this hotel was the was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The only redeeming factor is the proximity to the subway.  They rent most of the hotel out to a college for dorms or vacation stays. This means that the hotel is extremely loud and filled of drunk students. Every night I was woken up by kids screaming up and down the hallways.  As for the rooms, they are extremely small and filthy. I had to buy flip flops for the shower like a true college dorms. I had a leak in the bathroom that I complained about everyday and after day three nobody had come to look at.   Please please do yourself a favor and book at any of the other hotels. This hotel is listed at 3.5 stars but that’s only because of its lobby. The rooms are not better than",1,1
"OK, it is quite difficult to find a hotel in NYC that is somehow affordable and provides a room that has an adequate size. New Yorker Wyndham charged me USD 460 incl. tax and fees per night - and all I got was a broom closet. Impossible to place your suitcase or even backpack somewhere, the room was immediately no longer walkable. Windows were drafty, so I had to position the extra pillows in front of the window to avoid Nanga Parbat temperatures. Location is good, staff is more or less friendly but the entire facility urgently needs a refurbishment. After checkout I wanted to leave my 2 bags with the concierge for a couple of hours and after having paid USD 1.380 for my three nights the hotel charged me an additional 10 USD for the storage. As a frequent traveller I never",2,1
Disappointed after hearing this was a great hotel 😔. Room for 4 people is tiny and nothing like the photos on website! We could barely get into room & couldn’t even fit cases in. Had no option but to pay for upgrade as could not have lived on top of each other for 4 nights. Very dated and grubby. Definitely not 4*!,1,1
We booked this hotel based on bring  a 4 star hotel. We got very disappointed upon our arrival. We not even greeted properly by the staff and the reception. Our room was shockingly small and looked dirty and old. Our bedsheet and pillows were very uncomfortable. Bedsheets felt like toilet paper. Pillow were too uncomfortable and high that we had to take the ibuprofen on daily basis due to neck pain. I called the housekeeping and asked for a another type of problem pillow. She said this is our standard pillow and we do not have other options. We could hear the people next to us when they talked or even coughed. We also heard water running through the pipes. We approached the front desk with our concerns and the lady at the desk started with saying that she “has 20 years of,1,1
"Check in wasn't great, Greeted by OZLEM, at reception, who had a very bad manner. she then asked for a $200 deposit, incase we break anything, well let me tell you, there was absolutely nothing to break.weirdly the couple booking in next to us, were not asked for a deposit, so its definitely up to who checks you in and their mood.   we in for a shock- for a 4*, I would grade it a 2, the room was 4sqm, . It was clean, the bedding, towels and shower curtain was brand new, but it was a very dated decor, that needed a urgent update. The window looked out onto a brick wall. and to say I didn't sleep would be a under estimate , all night was dustcarts, sirens and people screaming. we had booked a bed and breakfast, and we were given token cards for the tick tock cafe attached to the",1,1
Good location near MSG and Penn station. The hotel has a number of floors/rooms occupied by students wasn’t expected by us. We are finding it difficult to sleep on a night due to noise from the windows you can’t avoid as a room swap did not cure the issue. Corridors and lifts need a refurb.   Don’t believe the 4* talk it’s more like a British 2 star hotel. Disappointed could be much nicer. Can fault staff.,2,1
"On two visits I requested early checkin but was told the room was not ready, in one case until 6pm. If I had  known I couldn’t get into my room before 4-6pm I would have cancelled and gone to another hotel.   Late departure seems to have priority over early checkin, so I will not return to this hotel.",2,1
"My wife and I booked New York for our 1 year wedding anniversary.  We booked the New Yorker hotel as it's somewhere my wife had always wanted to stay and with it being an iconic hotel in New York and it's skyline.  Upon arrival to the hotel, at the check in desk we were met by a very rude lady who told us that in addition to the resort / facility fee of $32 a night, we also needed to hand over a credit card for them to hold a further $400 to be held as a security deposit in case of damage to the room. When we said that all of our money is in cash, they said that if we wanted to pay this in cash they would charge up to $900?!? We advised that this was our spending money so they agreed to reduce this to $475 which was a massive chunk of our spending money. Excellent service (NOT).",2,1
"I usually don't write reviews but feel compelled to share the lousy experience that many travellers would not expect from a hotel under Wyndham, let alone in an iconic hotel like the New Yorker. To get started, I've stayed there for about 5 days with a baby.   I came back one night to find that my little travelling kettle that I use for making hot water for the baby's milk missing. Couldn't find it after ransacking the entire family room. Now imagine doing that with the baby crying for his milk! When I called the front desk they aren't sure what happened and reckoned that it could be taken by one of their staff. Only after a few phone calls that they deduced it could be taken by their security team but couldn't confirm as 'the team is off duty'. What comes next takes the ante -",2,1
"Stayed here for 4 nights. Started out bad when I asked about the facility fee ($100.96) and what is was for. They explained it included use of the following: Business center, which we had no need for and said we didn't want to use it. Fitness center, which we had no need for and said we didn't want to use it. National and international calls, which we had no use for and said we didn't want to use. ""Premium"" WiFi, which when you went to to WiFi portal page said it was free and also shouldn't even be included under this charge as the facility fee is taxed and the PITFA (Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act) bans all taxation on internet and email services. So by proxy the internet service has been taxed.  When I said we didn't want to pay it as we were not going to use any of the",2,1
Artived here for a 5 day stay.  Firstly the travel agent misled me a put the hotel if you could call it that. Secondly the mouthy receptionist smiled when she charged me an add £550 in security deposit ....not a good advert....then room wasn't what was booked.  A view of the Empite State building....in reality review over a derelict building site. Room was like a wardrobe and you had to close the door to use the bathroom. No food no coffee and charged $30 per night for the privilege of using the tv or internet even if you didn't.  No seats in reception because they were to idle to turn them round for people to sit on whilst they decorated the Xmas tree a day late as Thanksgiving was the day before . I sat on the back of a setee and was ordered to get of it even though I am,1,1
"Room is tiny - understandable considering this is NewYork. But toiletries were not good quality. Room keep smelling sometimes. If you want to store cool drinks or some eatables, there's no fridge at all. Coffee/Tea Machine is not there. Even small 2 or 3 star hotels offer these basic amenities.",1,1
Just got back from this hotel yesterday. This was my 3rd visit to New York and probably my last. Previously stayed near grand central and on 42nd street/Times Square.  Chose this hotel for the location and it was part of a virgin holidays deal with lounge access at Heathrow.  Arrived at JFK (what a joke immigration is!) and got the air train and LIRR straight to Penn station in half an hour.  Reception allowed us to check in early for no fee into our queen metro room ( did ask about upgrading but for $65+ tax per night didn’t bother). Corridors to the room looked like something from American horror story (the hotel one) and the room was very small. It was clean enough but very tatty and rough around the edges but we were told the other side of the hotel had been upgraded and,2,1
Paid 600$ for 5 nights here. On arrival got charged a further 550$ in taxes security deposit and compulsory service charges for electric water and internet.. Reception doesnt look bad. Staff smile as you get ripped off.  Lifts antiquated corridors dirty and scruffy looking and rooms so small like tiny boxes crammed in together. No kettle so cant make a drink. Bathroom like something out of the 1920s old fashioned and out dated. No breakfast allowed so have to go out all the time to eat. Wouldn't reccomend this dump to anybody. There are a lot of better hotels than this place,1,1
"I had one night at the New Yorker when I unexpectedly decided to book an extra night in New York City. At $343 for the night, it was not cheap by any means, but most similar hotels were priced around the same at the time (mid October 2019).  The hotel has a pretty late check in time of 4 PM (compared to the standard 3 PM) and indeed, when I checked in, I was told my room was not ready, so I decided to store my bag until I could check in later. I was pretty shocked to learn that I had to pay a $5 fee to store my bag for a few hours. I've never been to a hotel before or since that charged for that ""service"".   Once I got to my room, I found that it was incredibly small and cramped. There was barely room for the bed. The room had no view either, except of the building opposite",2,1
"Booked 10 nights in this hotel through my travel agent and it was not cheap. Staff were great , room adequate however rooms were booked out to huge groups of college kids which meant no sleep for the last 5 nights .  Felt like I was staying at a backpackers or on school camp. Terrible. One star for staff and one for location.",2,1
The rooms themselves were fine. The hotel is FINE. Its an older building with interesting history and a pretty cool little set of museum stuff in the business area. But the rooms are VERY small. Which I know isn't that wild of a thing in New York City but its not ideal as I was traveling with a lot of luggage for a convention and had almost no room to put it. The bed took up half of the room. Which again I understand and its fine. Not Ideal but fine. My main issue and why I'm giving such a low rating is that when I booked my room well in advance in August I booked it for 2 people. I wasn't sure if my friend could come with me so I didn't add her name to reservation. That SHOULDN'T have mattered. But when I added her name to the reservation about a week before the check in date,2,1
"I am a world traveler and this was honestly one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. The fact that this hotel claims to be a 4 star hotel is an outright lie. I have stayed in several real 4 star hotels and this hotel is more like a 1 star hotel. The lobby looks nice and the photos of the rooms are extremely misleading which is all to trick travelers into thinking the hotel is actually decent, but this is all a lie. As soon as you get off the elevator to your room, the hallway is dim, carpets are old, walls need painting, and it smells musty. The rooms themself are literally a few feet larger than the bed and the bathroom was just mediocre and extremely old fashioned. The bath faucet dripped loudly the entire stay, there was hardly any counter space above the sink, and they",1,1
"I’ll get a couple positives out of the way, hence the 2 star review: -great location -comfortable bed -nice lobby  Now for the rest: -I understand part of this hotel’s appeal is the retro/Art Deco vibe, but literally nothing was updated or in good condition. I’ve stayed in plenty of hotels that trade in nostalgia and have been much nicer and better kept up.  -tiniest hotel room I’ve stayed in in a long time. Just a bed and a narrow walkway to the bathroom.  -Not nearly enough towels provided. Found this out the hard way when I was dripping wet and my husband had to call down for more towels. Took almost an hour for them to be delivered.  -the bathroom has no fan or ventilation. This means after you shower the whole bathroom and everything in it is literally dripping wet from the",2,1
"Just returned from a week at The New Yorker. I cant fault the position of the hotel but it is certainly not 4 star! Advertised as re modernised definitely not ! We booked a metro room which was supposedly modernised! Old sink and bath fittings decoration looking shabby and a TV which was supposedly flat screen which came out of the ark! The room was dark as we were facing another part of the hotel, only feet away.  They have rented out several floors to student accomodation which again is very strange for a 4star hotel and means at some times there is excessive noise. When you book on arrival they then sting you for a $40 a night facility fee ontop of your original booking . This is for the business centre , Gym and something else quite random and even if you dont want to use",2,1
"Have to say as a 1st time in New York that I was so disappointed with what is a 4star hotel. Had contacted the hotel on several occasions to request a high floor looking towards the Empire state building. I also requested a fridge in the room which I paid for. On Arrival the hotel put us in what I can only describe as a prison cell. There was no enough room to swing a cat and a view of a building wall. There was pieces of old paper hiding cracks in the bathroom door!!!. I immediately went to reception to complain and despite showing the confirmation emails of my request they were stubborn and unhelpful. Eventually they agreed to move the next day but we had to pick up the cost of the ""upgrade"" onto a accessible room. We agreed that all our belongings would be moved by the staff",1,1
"I booked this hotel for one night during a quiet week and arrived early hoping a room was available for early check-in.  Desk confirmed they did in fact have rooms ready, but that there is a $50 ""early check-in fee""!  I have traveled around the world and stayed in countless hotels and have NEVER been asked to pay a fee for early check-in, even in the famous ripoff town of Vegas.  I decided to store my bags and avoid the fee, and found the hotel charges $5 PER BAG to store bags for their guests!  Finally, upon check-out I noticed a ~$35 ""resort"", or ""destination"" fee (can't remember exactly what they called it).  I know these added fees, which are not made clear at time of booking are becoming more common...but still a clear ripoff.  It is no wonder AirBnB is taking so much",1,1
"Possibly the worst hotel we have ever stopped in. We paid for an upgraded room which was awful. The room was tiny, the toilet had feaces marks in it, the skirting boards were rotten and falling off. We reported it to the reception who were extremely rude and unwilling to help. A great city with an awful hotel carrying it's name.",1,1
"One of the worst things about this hotel besides the inadequate rooms, terrible bathrooms and depressing decor is the rude staff at the reception desk. Whenever you need to engage with them for anything they act as if you’re a bother. I asked about why our wifi said that we were only getting 200 mb of internet per day after paying an exorbitant $45 resort fees which states fast internet on their site. The person at reception said he didn’t know, so he went to ask his manager and he didn’t know either. So he gave me the number of the internet provider they use and said I could call them and ask if I want to! Unbelievable.  My son’s suitcase was lost in LA but was found and was arriving in NY the next day. When I went to ask if it had arrived the disinterested reception worker",1,1
"Booked and paid in full ahead of travel directly with the hotel an executive double double with a view. Room not ready on arrival which was fine as we were early, charged $5 per suitcase to store them, not impressed with that, rooms in NYC are expensive so to charge extra for storing luggage is outrageous.  Was allocated a room on 31st floor, not executive and so small you couldn’t swing a mouse in there let alone a cat. Tiny window in corner of room, certainly not a view. Back to reception and told them the room was not acceptable as not what we had booked and paid for. We were given a room in 18th floor which was an executive and did have a view...but only 1 double bed. Back to reception for 3rd time, by this time I had steam coming out of my ears. We were then told they had",2,1

"Seriously, it's a terrible hotel. I stayed here for a work trip as it was in a good location but that's about the last good thing about this place. There's a big difference between having a vintage aesthetic and simply having old furniture and decor. Long lines in lobby. Understaffed front desk. No concierge to speak of. Guests always have show key card to rude attendants. Elevators slow and stinky. Hallways are musty, worn and dim. Room key worked half the time (made many trips back down to front desk to wait in line). Carpets are disgusting - at least a couple decades old. Chair is even worse.  Old and stained, definitely did not want to sit in the stanky ass thing. Lighting is real bad - like staying in an old 80's Beijing apartment. Water pressure was amazing though. No",1,1
"We stayed for 4 nights in October, booked as a package holiday with Virgin, on arrival at the hotel we were told our reservation couldn’t be found, we stood there for a long time while an abrupt woman on reception disappeared with our passports, eventually came back and said they had booked us in for last year same dates and we were down as no shows. We booked a package holiday and our flights were correct so clearly this wasn’t our fault however we were treated as though it was. We were advised they needed to put a $300 hold on my credit card for a new room and for the inconvenience we would be upgraded. Went up to our room on the 25th floor, if that room and floor was an upgrade I would have hated to see where we were originally booked, as soon as you step out of the lift the",1,1
"Does not seem like a 4-star hotel at all. The staff was rude to us and housekeeping never changed out anything despite us removing the ""do not distrub"" sign. Bathroom had zero counter space, TV did not face the bed, one of the lights was burned out, and there were not outlets on one side of the bed. At least the location is good.",1,1
"Stayed here for family holiday, good location, room clean but very old fashioned, but really annoyed to be charged for left luggage on last day. Five dollars per item (our bags were small, but five in total - so twenty five dollars). This on top of paying over one hundred and thirty dollars in taxes. Prior to staying here, after booking, called to confirm reservation and were told twice they couldn’t find our booking. In a saturated market, this just isn’t good enough, definitely would not stay at a Wyndham hotel again. Would not recommend.",1,1
"If you are looking for a rude and threatening checking in please go to the Wyndham New Yorker. It was definitively the worst reception I ever had in a hotel. At our check in, the staff literally took the credit card off my hands, charged me twice the amount and then when I asked him he started to yelling with us, threatening us in a way I have never seen in any hotel. I had to call my bank to cancel the one of the double charge. Despite the rude and threatening reception, I would also mention that the hotel charge you a ""resort"" fee of U$ 39, despite absolutely nothing is offered for this service (not even a small fridge or even a single coffee). Overall, I would never recommend this rude place. It will ruin your beautiful and nice trip to NYC.",1,1
"Rooms are old, dated and small. Corridors look like something out of 1920's movie. Totally disappointed in Wyndham for even trying to pass this hotel off a 4 star's. I did not expected to be given three different room keys to find a room that was suitable to me as a member and timeshare owner.",2,1
"In general the experience was fine, nice views and the room was nice. I think they should fix the toilet, because it looks really old. But the employees are rude, mostly on the reception. It is very sad that in a nice hotel, the people working there, don't respect you as they have to.",1,1

Pros-- -Excellent location -Art Deco details -Staff at check-in were friendly and efficient -Shower pressure and hot water were excellent   Know before you go: --I had read the reviews about the small rooms and they are all true. We had a Metro View Queen, and I could have reached out from the open door and touched the bed. The closet had a luggage rack, but there was nowhere to unfold it.

"I am Wyndham Diamond and this is the worst NY hotel I have ever stayed at. The front desk staff are amazing and made the most of what they have to offer, but the hotel itself is in DIRE NEED of an upgrade.   We stayed at the Terrence Suite and the room smelled like puke. No one was available to clean so family had to sleep in a puke smelling couch overnight until cleaning staff was available to clean.  The next day, the toilet clogged and we had to call again.  They said they would charge us $3.00 when my grandmother asked for hot water until a very nice manager saw that I was wyndham diamond and sent over complimentary water.   The rooms and bathrooms are ridiculously outdated.",1,1

Someone on the staff scolded me in front of a group of people for trying to use the stairs after a fire alarm had just gone off at 6:30 a.m. We were given the all clear to go back to our rooms, but apparently he wasn't okay with me using the stairs and he was really rude. I was allowed access to use the stairs 10 seconds afterwards. Then, later in the day a guy let a huge number of people by to get on the elevators. He saw me and for some reason forced me to show him a room key. He also used attitude and was rude after I asked why he'd let everyone else past, but me.

The room was very small with very poor harsh lighting. The closet couldn't be opened all the way because of the over sized desk, and there was no lighting in the closet for the safe, so had to use my phone's flashlight for that.

The agent at the front desk then deflected blame onto booking.com and said I should try calling the phone # on the email instead. An hour later I finally got my room. The hotel attempted to make things right by waiving the $35 charge but my mood had already turned sour for the rest of the night. I will definitely NOT be staying here again.,1,1

The hotel isn’t cheap so I would expect a basic level of service but it simply did not exist. The only 2 members of staff that actually made a difference was Herbert & Miss Henry (& we thank you for that!)

"I stayed a total of 4 nights in September. I was visiting NYC with my son, and booked a double bed. Points against: double bed was way too small, so was the room; water faucets were terribly old, with the bath faucets not able to turn properly. Carpets were old too. The worst thing about this hotel is that all elevators take forever to arrive. It is an old property I appreciate, but surely the owner ought to have considered an overall renovation to make the hotel more efficient. Sole saving grace, the Tick Tock Diner, which opens 24 hours. I will not consider this property again. No matter how near is it to the Penn Station, the streets in and around this huge hotel are dirty and I see much to improve to enhance the stay for all guests.",2,1

The following day, another traveler walked into my room, as he was assigned the room I was in. I was just out of the shower and naked at the time, so a tad inconvenient. I needed to use the business office but my key did not work, had to wait for 15 mins in line to get my key authorization to the business center.

First of all, the night when we arrived (Saturday) we had to wait almost 1 hour to be checked in because there was only one agent at the front desk. Check-in itself were not informative at all. No explanation about services offered, facilities, restaurants, nothing. Bellmen were not available neither. Room are small but clean and with a nice view. There’s no fridge. Bathroom very small. At the check-out they charge you with additional fees for they stay and for keeping your luggage in the bellman room.

It’s noisy (I was on the 29th floor) and I wish I could have seen it “way back then”....because the heavy doors, marble trim on the walls, Art Deco artifacts by the elevators all look charming.

Barely any natural lights gets in so the rooms are dark and gloomy. Also really ill thought out in terms of placing of electrical sockets, i.e. none near the mirror for plugging in hairdryers etc. The shower in one of the rooms had a constant dripping.

"Definitely not a 4* hotel as advertised. Old, dated, aging hotel. Rooms are tiny, with a musty, damp odor - charges for everything including storing baggage (never heard of such a thing before), refrigerator, coffee maker etc.  Best avoided in favor of any number of hotels in the area.",2,1
"The hotel has very small rooms. Very noisy as rooms face 8th Avenue and are directly across the street from Penn Station. Very clean with friendly staff. Unfortunately, they charge $5.00 for each bag to store prior to check in and check out.  The lobby is great and the hotel’s architecture is Art Deco as it opened in 1930. Good place to visit.... would not stay here again, did not feel safe at night and security did not ask to see each guests room key prior to getting in the elevator!",2,1
"We had 6 people in our party so booked a suite at The New Yorker. The suite looked nothing like the photos on the website. I know that NY hotel rooms are much smaller than other cities but I did expect the suite to be a little larger. The small pull out sofa in the living room was stained, there was no coffee maker in room (later found out they charge for it, which is a first for me) bathroom was very dated, small and no counter to place items on. The AC did not work well at all so we were very warm, and there was no hot water the day we checked in. We had 6 people take cold showers. I called housekeeping at one point for extra towels and they never showed up. Overall, so not a good experience. I've stayed at the Lotte New York Plaza and the W Hotel in Times Square. Huge",2,1
"I have been staying at The New Yorker since 1996.  I have stayed in excess of 30 times, and frequently as long as 3 weeks in duration.  I have been honored to have worked with Carola Peppe, Patricia Ryan and, best of all, Madeline Marte -- all excellent  reservation specialists who ALWAYS managed to secure Suite 4005 for me.  This suite is, in my opinion, the best in the building.  On the 40th floor south-east corner, it looks directly at the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building from the east, and all the way down to the Statue of Liberty from the south: definitely the most spectacular New York City view I have seen, including from some of the famous landmarks.  Unfortunately, the hotel has gone steadily downhill since it was purchased by Wyndham.  Since I always got",1,1
"Will not spend my points to stay there again. Extremely dirty. Hair everywhere. Tiny bedroom. Not to mention only 1 person at front desk, and the longest line to check in. Very disappointed. Never again.",1,1
"We stayed here for our first week in NYC at the iconic NY hotel, from the photos I see there are very nice rooms but ours was old dated and dingy. It was very small, the bathroom was right out of the 1960s and it was old and daggy.",2,1
"We went here thinking since it was close to Broadway, we could enjoy the show we had tickets for without walking.   We don't mind walking, but wow, super far.   Also, rooms were extremely small and sheets were stained and rough.   One flat pillow each ,seriously?  One towel each mind you, I have long hair and need one for my hair as well but they didn't answer the phone upon Calling the front.    Extremely long lines and poor service.",1,1
"Poor customer service and poor quality of rooms. The trip started off with a room that had a smelly odor, dirty tub and towels, and dirty linen. I went down to tell the front desk (after waiting 10 minutes for an elevator). They moved me to a new room that at least didn't smell bad (still dirty though). For price of this hotel, it is absolutely unacceptable to be exposed to this low level of quality in the rooms. The customer service is also horrible. When I wanted to checkout there was a long line so I called to see if there was anything else I needed to do to check out. The lady on the phone was very rude and yelled at me when I said that I had already left the room without letting them know (which doesn't make any sense to me - since I was calling to LET THEM KNOW). After a",1,1
"Good Service but Outdated property needs major work.  Room Key Failures, Elevators packed with people stopping on every floor (20+ minutes to get out every morning) and rust in the bathroom.  Not a good experience",1,1
"I can't even review this hotel because they cancelled my reservation the day of arrival. Altough the reservation made through booking mentions the payment is at the hotel, they tried to get the first night out of my credit card before my arrival. Because it didn't work they've sent me an email to change credit card information which I didn't read because I was flying to NY. So the reservation made 5 months before was cancelled just like that. Upon check-in they informed me that they couldn't give any room because the hotel was overbooked. So this hotel allowed for my family with small children and an elderly person stayed in the street in a New York friday evening. I've never seen such thing before in my life. Fortunately I found online a better hotel for the same price just one",1,1
"The hotel was dirty--esp the bathroom. There was only room for a bed and desk. No mini-fridge as promised. (I spent very little time in the hotel, but still.) The check-in lady was extremely rude (but the check out man was very nice). The elevators are slow and even though they are divided, it takes forever to get one. If you are an upper floor like I was, you can take 30 flights of stairs down but going back up is a pain.   Tick-tock diner was a little overpriced, but the highlight of the hotel anyway. Open 24/7 with a really nice and friendly staff. Try the carrot cake!   In all, I've stayed at similarly priced hotels in better locations in Manhattan with better clearner rooms",2,1
"Poor check in, additional charges for every little item including leaving bags with the bell boy. No tea and coffee facility in the room despite confirming in the original booking. Rooms were very small and with very old furniture.",1,1
"The hotel was very nice and on arrival we were upgraded as we had booked three rooms and they wanted to make sure we were all together which was great. We handed over a credit card to pay for any extras we might incur during our stay, again this was fine. Upon waking on our last morning we found a bill for $130 per room labelled ‘facilities fee’. This was for WiFi, gym and business services. The only one we used was WiFi but this came up as free when we logged on. Apparently we should have been made aware of this fee when we booked as everyone pays it. We weren’t and it isn’t mentioned on our reservation paperwork. On checking the credit card bill when we got home we found that the hotel had charged us on checking in without telling us at the time. £321 for WiFi. Not good.",2,1
"The hotel charged a facilities fee ($30 a night) on checkout. This was not mentioned in any prior communication by them, which includes a lot of emails advertising the final rate.  I can understand additional charges for which the amount varies based on the services you use during your visit. But given that this is a fixed charge that will be levied in any scenario, why not include this is the final amount at the time of booking? I don't see any difference between this and resort fees, and a lot of hotels charge the latter upfront. And I made the booking using the Wyndham site itself, no third party. I find this intentionally deceptive on the resort's part.  The cleanliness, size of the rooms, and the service at the place was quite mediocre. The only reason I chose this place",1,1
"The entrance is amazing and reception is clean, bright & an area of calm. First impressions were great & we were happy to be staying in an iconic New York landmark! Unfortunately, the room was disapointing - it was average size and the beds were comfortable. The cleanliness however is not up to standard in a hotel of this alledged calibre - the head of housekeeping needs to inspect the room more thoroughly.The bath needs an upgrade - the attached photo shows the base of the bath with ground in dirt that cant be removed. The back of the bathroom door also needs a thorough clean as did other areas where dust collects. The decor in the room is tired & another small inconvenience was that the TV is not wall mounted and this takes up surface space. Not having a fridge or tea/coffee",2,1
Had a confirmed booking but when I showed up the front desk said the hotel was sold out and in the negative for rooms.  Did not offer solutions or assistance or walk me to another hotel they are partnered with.  Called the company I booked with and in 20 minutes they had me booked at another property.  I would seriously consider not going to this hotel if they oversell online.  It was a busy night in the city so I am lucky I had another option.,1,1
- Noisy room beside elevator machine - requested another room and had to wait next day - the original room had extra bathroom because I paid for that and the new one didn’t have and you charged  - I had to go to your front desk 4 times to solve everything (wasted 2 hours in total),1,1
"Requested suite with 2 double beds & sofa bed,did not get. Room wasn’t even ready at 430 when check In was 4pm. Smoke alarms went off in middle of night & we were in lobby til 430 in the morning. No explanation as to what happened. Never stay there again",2,1
"As I’m writing this review I don’t even know where to start.  It started on the day of our arrival our reservation was canceled while on the plane. So we arrived early evening with a very big surprise. The reception told us it wasn’t a problem and checked us in.. and guess what the price just went up the fees went up and till our surprise we had to pay more and more.. about $1200 more than the original booking price. Surprised, super tired and annoyed we checked In and decided to take this up with the manager the next morning and paid 2/3 of our stay.. Next morning we noticed the blankets we slept under (too tired to check everything cause you don’t expect that) had (blood) stains to us that’s pretty unforgivable and disgusting for a 4 star rated hotel.. as everything wasn’t bad",1,1
"This weekend I booked a room and accidently made two reservations. I contacted the hotel and the 3rd party multiple times too get help with this issue. To no avail Nobody would help me undo this disaster. A few days prior i was released from ICU from a stroke. IM 29, and this is all new too me medically.I booked the room in the first place bevciause I needed somewhere to stay close to my rehab center for the stroke. As soon as i realized that I had two hotels i immediately started chat/calls to try to elevate one but Wyndham refused as well as refused to even alter the dates. I take my health seriously and although im learning the side effects of a stroke. I would have thought that a company would take that into consideration as oppose to kicking me down agin and losing close",1,1
"The bedroom en toto was too small with a very uncomfortable, very small bathroom and no coffee maker in the room. The room had been painted but they did a sloppy job of it. Couldn't get consistency of the heat/cooling system. They should probably combine 2 rooms together in an upgrade.",1,1
"Where do I start, the AC IN THE ELEVATORS didn’t work so if you went from the 30 floor to the 1st and you stopped more than 3 times you are stuck in there for 3+ minutes. One of the days the hot water ran out. The “doorman” at the elevators are rude. They were understaffed when I received a package in the mail room and I had to wait a day to get it. The rooms are really small, they make them look big in the pictures. The AC inside the 2nd floor conference room does not work efficiently. Good things are it’s in a good location and it has a lot of history to it.  It’s way overpriced. Stay here one night to experience it then go to a newer hotel.",1,1
Overpriced for the small rooms and then since my room was to Shares between two adult males I needed a roll out bed and I was told that it would be $50 extra. I would have MAYBE paid it but there was no room for that in the already small room we had....pretty shocked...I’ve seen motels have bigger space for one third the price...,1,1
"We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. Rooms were cramped and not adjoining as we asked, we were told they were on the same floor and that was the best they could do! No tea/coffee making facilities and staff were mostly offhand bordering on rude especially after we had checked out and were waiting for our taxi. We had to pay an extra £352:00 dollars for facility tax on top of what had paid our travel agent(travel consultants) and when I questioned it I was told it's just something they do and not all hotels do it and they could only apologise! Doesn't help my bank balance",1,1
"Watch out if you change tour reservation.  They’ll charge you for the full amount of your previous reservation.  I was told I’d get at least a partial refund, but they did not honor that. The place itself is pretty nice, but being shaken down for hundreds of dollars is not so nice.",1,1
The room we had wasn’t too small as some other reviewers have commented but it was in need of some serious updating. My sister arrived a couple of nights after us and her room was updated but on the second night there was water leaking from upstairs coming through a light. They had nowhere to move them too!  Only about half of the elevators actually work and for a period of time the side that goes to the higher floors was broken and we were on the 27th floor. Staff is as rude as everyone else in NYC. Lots of homeless people right outside the hotel. Convenient location to get to get around. Not that we went to NYC to watch TV but their DirectTV service went out one evening during a storm for an extended period and most of the time a lot of the channels were fuzzy. I wouldn’t stay,2,1
"Waited in line for check-in close to 5 hours because of IT problems without information, drinks or any other help. In the end got a wrong room without terrace as paid for and got breakfast coupons as compensation after complaining.",1,1
"Staff are slow, rude and belittling. If you look under 40 expect to be made to present your room card every time you pass through the lobby whilst the couple next to you breeze through and be told to have a good evening all whilst your being interrogated for proof that you booked a room. Rooms are old. TV looks like it’s 30 years old. WiFi is terrible and you have to log in every time you use it. You can hear every word of the conversation behind all four walls in your room so do not bank on getting much sleep. It looks as though it has been in need of a refurb for about 30 years if not more. Good location and it looks cool from the outside are the only two pluses. I’ve stayed in better in NYC for the same money. I actively avoided a Wyndham hotel in Washington because of my",2,1
"Already informed staff, but slow response and rude. Account team just informed me they don’t know what receptionist check, they just charged by themselves. Issues cannot be resolved. Terrible service.",2,1
"Their computers were down.  I arrived at 11:45pm and there ere about 40 people in line already waiting to be checked in.  At 1:30am, I could no longer stay awake and slept on the lobby floor.  At 3am the line had not moved.  At 5:30am about half the line had been processed.  At 7:56am the couple in front of me who had been waiting since 8:45pm was finally checked into their room.    I decided to change my clothes and brush my teeth in the lobby bathroom.   I asked the hotel for a refund since I had prepaid.  They said they would see what they could do.  I have not been refunded.  Hotels.com has not been helpful.  I paid $203 to sleep on a dirty lobby floor.    Take my advice — spend the extra $50 and go to a nice hotel instead.  One where the staff cares about your experience.",1,1
"My family and I recently stayed at this hotel. What can I say apart from it is appalling! From the moment you arrive at the New Yorker all they are interested in is getting your money. We were early and told that we could pay a $50 early check in fee. I asked if there was a place we could leave our bags and was told, yes no problem but it will cost you $5 per bag (we had 8!) so I payed the $50. The room, tiny. I know rooms in New York are small but these are smaller than usual. The rooms are tired and dark. The bath was chipped and tiles in the bathroom were broken. The hotel lobbies are dirty and in need of fresh wining up. I booked a car to take me to the airport and was charged  $130 to La Guarda, which is a 30 minute journey! I was told to pay cash otherwise it would cost me",1,1
"My wife and I stayed at the New Yorker for the first 5 nights of our honeymoon  The staff were rude at check in we advised them it was our honeymoon and got the response “so what” We got up to the room which was unbelievably small, I went for a shower and the fitting coming out of the wall was leaking and sprayed all over the bathroom, We went down to the tick Tock cafe in the lobby for breakfast we ordered and they got my wife’s order of pancakes with bacon wrong they brought her pancakes with burgers and when told the server he said “well the burgers are nice everyone likes burgers” obviously she said no I would like bacon please and the server through us a dirty look and stormed off  The hotel is very dated, dirty and you are made to feel very unwelcome   I wouldn’t stay",1,1
"Will not be staying at this Wyndham property.The room was a shoe box No amenities. The car we were traveling was damaged by the valet and Wyndham wants to claim that they hire that out,but we were billed by Wyndham.",2,1
"I booked on their website. When I needed to change the reservation, the front desk said I didn't have a valid confirmation # from the hotel, that it came from a 3rd party and they couldn’t help me.  What a rip off.  I had to talk to two different phone centers before they even put me through to the front desk.  I booked on their web site, not Priceline, Kayak, Trivago, Orbitz or Expedia but The NEW YORKER HOTEL A WYDHAM PROPERTY.  Moral of the story?  Skip the website and call your reservation in if you don’t want to get ripped off.  Or just plain skip the New Yorker - there are plenty of other hotels in the city with wonderful ambiance, great service, and web sites THAT DON’T RIP YOU OFF!!!!!!!",1,1
The hotel is dated but the experience was okay. Until I received my car back from valet and the molding down the side of my car was completely missing. Poor response from management of a blurry picture that showed the molding there when it arrived. Still no follow up from management. Nice area. Little over priced for the quality of the rooms. Don’t recommend parking a car here at all.,1,1
We stayed here for 10 nights. Not your average hotel stay. There were 2 of us. I’ve stayed here before but not for 10 nights. For nostalgic reasons and the history of this hotel is why we stayed here. We asked for additional towels which were provided but then were taken away from us days later while we were out for the day. At 6am each morning the smell of food woke us up. Not sure where it was coming from since there is no room service at this hotel. We had a nice view on the 35th floor but for 2 people the room was small. When asked if we could move to another room with more space I was told “no”. We moved furniture into the closet to make more space. The water temperature in the shower ran too hot or too cold. It fluctuates on its own. The sheets were not changed once the 10,2,1
"I booked a ""Queen Room"" for two nights. When we checked in I was charged an additional $45 per night and had to hand over my credit card for that charge. I assumed it was to cover any mini bar charges. However, when I got to the room there was no mini bar. I was told by the desk staff that it was for the ""Free WiFi and unlimited international calling"" I did not need international calling and the ""Free"" WiFi that cost me $45 per night was an unsecured network. Additionally, when we retired to bed we realized that the bed was a double and not a queen bed. When I complained to the manager on Duty I was told that ""all"" of the Queen rooms had double beds. I tried to explain that beds have names based on specific sizes and that you can not call a double a queen bed but I was told",1,1
"i paid for the family terrace suite,,,, the carpets were gross,, the shower was boiling hot and never got fixed,, there was zero furniture on the terrace even though we asked 5 times and were told they would put the outdoor furniture on the terrace, but never did,,, the tvs are from the 1980s and are super small ,, you would expect much much higher quality for a wyndham hotel,,, i was so glad to leave this place will never go back",1,1
"We came there twice in a week with huge queues to check in and out. The rooms are microscopic. You can go around the small double bed only if you have  no luggage...The only positive is that for a 40 story hotel they have an adequate number of lifts. At US$300 a room, never again.",1,1
"Location is good, hotel was ok BUT when we arrived, we had 3 rooms booked and the receptionist insisted that we had 5 and that they were paid for. We had informed him that should only have 3 but he said that they would go waisted and insisted that we should take them. So we took one so our son would not disturb his partner who had arrived before us considering it was after midnight. We checked out after 3 nights with a ZERO bill and 2 months later received the bill for 2 rooms. They admitted it was their mistake however still charged it to our credit card without our authorisation. We didn't even want the room. I can just imagine what my customers would say if I made a mistake, gave them a product they didn't need and 2 months later insist they pay for it!!",1,1
"I was very disappointed with the New Yorker - a Wyndham Hotel. The only real ""pro"" was its location - on 8th Ave near Times Square. I should note that some of the rooms had good views of the skyline - my room faced another wall of rooms 50 feet away. The experience started with lack of service - the couple that I was traveling with had a restaurant reservation that they were going to missed (NYC traffic), so I volunteered to take their bags to the New Yorker for them to pick up upon check-in. Unfortunately, there were no bell staff anywhere to be seen in the lobby or anybody at the luggage desk (this was only 8:15 in the evening). I had to go out front to draft a doorman to help check in the bags. He didn't know exactly how (he wanted to scrawl a first name on one of the three",2,1
It is the first day of our 3 day stay here and so far we had a hotel staff walked in on us after I just came out of the shower and my husband was dressing! She did not knock and we did not call to request anything from housekeeping.  She did apologize but this should not have happened.    The hotel room itself is below 4 star standard.  The location is great but after today’s experience I would rather stay elsewhere knowing both us and our belongings are safe.,1,1
"What a difference five years makes since our last stay here. Dirty, unhelpful and rude staff on the main desk. We were glad to leave to be honest. Hotel is in a great location though close to time square and Penn Station.",2,1
"Our group stayed for 4 nights (I stayed 6) and we definitely got a feel for the facilities and surrounding area.  Some observations: - The rooms and bathrooms are laughably small (even for NYC).   - I do not see the value for the cost of this hotel (I moved to a different hotel that was a few blocks away for the last two evenings).  The new hotel was on a quiet street vs 8th Ave, was over $100 cheaper, and was better in every single aspect. - The staff truly treats people with noticeable indifference (they are not rude, but no impression was given that they actually care). - The locals who also live in this building show great disdain for the tourists staying in the hotel (share an elevator with them and you will understand).    After my company paid for approximately 62 nights",2,1
"My friend booked a twin room for us here on June 22nd 2019 as we were having a girls night out in the city and wanted to stay over. After waiting in a huge check in queue at 3pm we eventually got to our room which was horrible. The whole floor where our room was situated actually stank, as soon as we got out of the elevator we could smell a disgusting damp, dirty odor. The room itself was small, cramped and dirty, the bathroom was disgusting and even had excrement marks on the floor. On examining the beds we found pubic hairs on the sheets which had clearly not been changed since the last guest. We decided we just couldn’t stay there and went down to reception to check out and ask for a refund. We were told that the room price, which we had paid in full in advance, was non",1,1
I chose The New Yorker primarily because of its proximity to Penn Station because I hate hauling suitcases on NY subways. The boiled price was fair but there was an extra amenities fee at the hotel.  That is  2 star loss for me right off the bat. The other star is for poorly paned glass windows and room doors that let in lots of noise.,2,1
"First impression of the lobby was good, but it all went downhill very quickly from there. Firstly, we requested a low floor upon booking (my gf is claustrophobic and cannot use lifts) but we had no response. We then emailed several times to confirm this, but still no response. Eventually we phoned ahead and they put our request down. On arrival, they put us on floor 21 - claiming they had no rooms lower down. Then, as if by magic, they find a 7th floor ""executive"" room which would cost us $50 per night to ""upgrade"" to. Not sure what the upgrade was - it was a smaller room with a tiny washroom (and only 1 bath robe). Probably made for a single occupant. I found this really opportunistic and callus of the hotel to get extra money from us. Next up, we had to locate the fire stairs",1,1
"I stayed here for three nights and while the location is great and the hotel is ok, not great, the service was very good. However, on checking out, they charged me $37.10 per night for a “facility fee”. That’s for wi-if and gym and business centre. I objected and told them the features had said free wi-fi and I hadn’t used anything else but the desk manager said that this charge stated on my booking. We searched and sure enough there it was, buried on the third page, below all of the bits that said I had paid everything in full already. This was a sneaky “stealth” fee and I will never book this hotel ever again. The booking was already expensive - €717.28 for just me for 3 nights - but this is just punitive and if I had known I’d have to pay another $120 I’d have found somewhere",1,1
"This place is old, dirty, outdated! We checked in to our suite, the couches were filthy and stained, the bar area had a garbage bin that was overflowing with trash that had probably been there for weeks. The bathrooms are gross small and outdated. Our bed made noise every time you moved. And it smelled like body odor. Do not stay here!!!!  They say online that the have been remodeled in 2019.... they are lying!!! And those pictures in their site are probably from 20 years ago! Save your money and go else where!",1,1
"Ive stayed at many different hotels in NYC and this was by far the worst.  The hotel foyer and staff are lovely but thats where it stops.  The room was small, lucky it was only me staying.  The bed was extremely hard and uncomfortable, the walls are super thin and could hear everything from next door, i mean everything!   No fridge, no coffee machine or room service.   Great location but a run down old hotel which was uncomfortable, there are better hotels in NYC for the price you pay here.",2,1
I am actually here now. We love NY and are regular visitors. We normally stay at the Accor at Times Square and have recommended it to many. Thought we would try a hotel steeped in history. And as it had been renovated we chose The New Yorker.  Cant see what has been renovated. Cracked tiles in bathroom. Some mildew too. Wallpaper peeling in room. Very small TV. The bar is closed now for renovation. Internet said rooftop bar 👍🏼 and Coffee makers. Rooms are dated with no view on the Hudson or Empire State Building. Can upgrade to a view for 15 a night. No coffee making facilities in the room not even a kettle. You can have one for 25  a night though. No guest info in the room. Concierge not helpful. Colleague told us new management are terrible nailing cost to the floor and have,2,1
Make a mandatory charge for services you may not want but they refuse to waive it if you do not want those services. Charge to store you bags if you arrive eraly or want to leave them for a couple of hours after checking out. Lifts broke down and we had to climb from 20th to 32nd floor but the staff were unapologetic and blamed the Fire Service. Room was cramped.,1,1
"We were really looking forward to our trip to New York, we got married in New York back in March 2019 and we stayed at the New Yorker hotel, the lobby and coffee ares looked really good but once we got to our room we were not impressed at all, the room was really small and very dated, carpet was well worn the lighting was dim, there was no coffee/tea making facility in the room which we are not used to, the only positive we can say about our stay was the bed, i cant remember when we have ever slept in a more comfortable bed, real quality. but sadly that was the only thing that was quality, i would not stay here again so therefore i can not recommend this hotel. we visited New York, Las Vagas and Mexico on this trip and for me New Yorker hotel was by far the worst one we stayed",2,1
"The room was EXTREMELY smaller than advertised, Not only that, but a balcony at the hotel had a direct view into the room. I was extremely disappointed with the hotel considering the rate. Look elsewhere if you are looking to book in NYC and if you are looking to avoid the touristy areas, defintely do not book here.",2,1
So the plus side the hotel is near Macy’s and you can walk to most things.Booking in the staff were all happy and were told we were fully paid .But we then got a bill for resort fees ! I politely said were were told when we booked in that we had paid in full.The woman on the reception was defensive and gave us a bit of a lecture! Add insult to injury then we get charged 5 dollars to hold onto the bags for 2 hours.,2,1
"Me & my friend stayed here in May for 4 nights we booked two double beds. The room was small but beds comfy and as for New York your not in your room. The hotel is tired and jaded. Deffo needs a make over. Or even a lick of paint In places. It was clean. And great for msg concert we was going too. And the security to get to your room was a nice touch. But would I stay here again.. deff no , on arrival it was early hours handed over my credit card. Which was to pay the service charge, fine. As we had already paid for the stay via our travel Company. Upon our last day I got a call from my husband telling me we had a charge of £1500 on the credit card. Went back to the hotel and we had been charged for our whole stay and the hotel charges had been charged x 4 now we had already",2,1
"When we arrived at the hotel there were a lot of people standing around waiting. I was wondering why. When it was our turn to check in, we were initially told that our room wasn’t ready and it was almost 8pm. I told them I was a diamond member and they assigned us a room. We thought it was a good thing but we were wrong. When we opened the door to our room, it was a room that someone was still staying in. We walked right out and I went downstairs to complain. They gave us another room but it was much smaller and it was just horrible. The hotel is poorly managed and employees can be nice but don’t do anything to accept responsibility for their actions by making the stay a little better because of the unprofessional action of giving us someone else’s room that was still occupied.",1,1
Didn’t have AC in room night before my daughters college graduation at Hulu Theatre across street.  No sleep.  I have stayed here before without a problem years prior.  Seems we got the older part of hotel that weekend.,2,1
"Any decent hotel - especially one in a major city - provides its guests with a coffee/tea maker in their room.  Not, however, the Wyndham New Yorker.  If you want this very basic amenity in what used to be a good hotel in a most convenient location, you will be extorted to the tune of $25 a night!  The New Yorker has some lovely, comfortable,  refurbished Art Deco rooms, and others with great views of the Empire State Building - but it clearly can’t be bothered to make its guests feel welcome with this simplest requirement the for traveler.  That’s just shameful for what used to be a nice place to stay.",2,1
"I have just returned from spending 3 nights here. We had to move room several times as the room cleanliness was very poor. First room had mould round the bath and a terrible smell. The second room was so small and had a window that was the smallest window I’ve ever seen. After complaining, the manager was called and he upgraded our room. Our room was a lot bigger and was better but still very basic. There is no fridge in the rooms like they say, there was no bath stopper either and when I requested one I was told to take a shower. I wanted a bath and it took them 45 minutes to bring a bath stopper to the room. Check in is at 4pm and check out is 11am, not what they advertise when booking. The location is very good but there is much better hotels to pick over this one. Left",2,1
"There was rubbish on the cloakroom and she was totally dusty. The blanket was dirty and stained. The lamps were dusty. In some corners I could not define if it was mold or dirt. There was a bloodstain in the bathroom on the wall. The drain of the shower was totally rusted, the crane of the shower also.  Upon arrival, nearly $ 400 was required as a deposit, although in advance the entire trip was paid. These were charged to the credit card and have not been refunded so far. Today is the 4th of June and on the 16th of May I left. An hour longer stay in the hotel room cost 50 euros. That's too much! The service was not exactly  friendly and did not prove to me until today what exactly was charged as a deposit. At my request, I always got only the information that it will be paid",1,1
"We stayed 9 nights in this hotel.  I'll start with what's good about the hotel (but do read to the end for the cons): 1. The hotel lobby is grand and gives a great first impression.  2. If you love history, this hotel is full of historical moments.  3. It is a 5 second walk from the restaurant to the entrance of the ACE Penn Station Subway.  4. It is a 20min walk to Time Square, Chelsea, Empire State Building.  5. The rooms are sufficiently large (we had two queen size beds and enough space for 8 pieces of luggage), the air con is good. The Wifi is stable (I did an afternoon of work in the hotel) 6. The gym is decent with 4 treadmills. Dumbbells goes up to only 50lb so for those who train with heavier, it might be a problem. However, there are the standard machines but no racks,",2,1
"The WC had toilet paper in the pan and long dark hairs over the seat. The bathroom shelf sloped so everything slid off. The room was tiny, with just a Queen bed with little room on each side (there were 2 of us). We had had a very long journey from Niagara Falls (thunderstorms on drive to airport and La Guardia closed for 2 hours) and just staying for one night so were too tired to try to change rooms. We had a prepaid room but were charged $29 plus tax when we arrived which seemed steep. When I checked out the receptionist asked me about the stay and I replied ‘the worst hotel room I had ever stayed in’ - pardon she said so I repeated my reply. I did say ‘you did ask but also that I was not blaming her, but that she did ask the question and therefore got an honest reply. She",1,1

Upon arriving in the hotel myself and my friend we're tired from travelling from Vegas and arrived early in the morning. We received no welcome from reception and we're sent to a filthy room which was no bigger than a postage stamp certainly different from the pictures we we're shown. I immediately went down to reception to complain to be told we would have to wait for housekeeping to come and clean it and we could not change rooms. Upon asking a family member to call the travel agent and ask to speak to a manager we we're then told we could move rooms hours later. The receptionist then made us out to be liars and said we could have changed rooms all along. The room was still filthy with rust all over the tiny bathroom however the room was bigger and we we're exhausted so we,1,1
"After reading reviews prior to booking this hotel I was excited about our upcoming stay. To say the least after our visit very disappointed. Location is worth 5 out of 5. That is where it ends. We were on the 21st floor. The bed was meant to be a Queen size bed, it was not double at the most. The pillows were about 400mm square pillows. If living out of a suitcase you could only have one suitcase open as there was not enough room for 2 to be open. The room was very small. No refrigerator, no coffee or tea making facilities, plastic cups in the room. Then when we were checking out we were hit with a $30 per day facility fee for use of gym. I did not know there was a gym and therefore never used it but still needed to pay. I am unsure which rooms they have upgraded certainly was",2,1
"Let’s start off with the following, for a month prior to our stay not only did I, but also our travel agent tried emailing both reservations and concierge on multiple occasions to arrange an upgrade, bizarrely no one got back to either of us. When we arrived, check in asked for my credit card which I assumed was for bond...however I’ve now just found that my card has been deducted over $475 AUD in addition to the already $2300 AUD we paid for a weeks stay.  This is not acceptable, a charge like this should be discussed properly before charging someone’s credit card.   This room was seriously the smallest hotel room I have stayed in (smaller than my own bedroom at home). As a couple we have two suitcases, there was barely any room to store them which resulted in them being in the",2,1
I visited this hotel 2 years ago and was so impressed. We went over from the uk and after the long flight the guy at reception gave us early check in and breakfast vouchers. We have just come back from our second trip to the same hotel and what a difference. The lady at reception was very rude and wasn’t welcoming at all. We also had to pay $29 per night facility charge which we had no idea about and never paid it first time there. We were very tired due to our early flight and couldn’t check in early .. then we had to pay to put our luggage in with the concierge. They have also taken out the tea/coffee facility in the rooms. When I get home to the uk and check my account they have taken two lots of money coming to over £200! I have no clue what this is for and I’m very,2,1
"This hotel is located in a great spot but that is pretty much the best I can say... For a 4 star hotel I was largely disappointed with my stay, the room was shabby, very noisy from within and out of the hotel, TV reception was bad and I ended up slipping and bruising and grazing myself quite severely in their non slip shower/bath. So much potential but didn't meet minimal expectations at all.",2,1
"Stayed here luckily only for one night as that was enough,  found reception staff rude when we checked in, rooms are small and dated, I had emailed them previously to ask for one of the rooms to be a twin as it was for adult brother and sister? It wasn’t a twin when we arrived and when I rung they said they couldn’t give them a twin as the hotel was full. Wouldn’t stay here again if someone paid me!",2,1
"Location and staff are outstanding.  This place nickels and dimes you to debt and at the same time charges $35 resort fee.  The only benefit is free wifi (which you have to sign in everyday.  The food is awful.  Bathrooms are tiny and there is little space for toiletries.  Would never stay here again.  Would have given the place 0, but for the outstanding and helping staff.",2,1

"First off, staff were fantastic and friendly, and went out of the way to give us information, offer service etc.  The hotel however... no hot water flask, paper cups in the room, unreliable water temperature in the showers, terribly outdated furniture and designs, television from the 1980s, mineral water not provided, dusty hairdryer, starchy bedsheets... the list would probably be longer if I stayed more than a night.   Only stay if you are a Nikola Tesla fan.",1,1
This already overpriced (over $300 per night without breakfast!) hotel added a further $27 per day ‘Facility Fee’ when we were checking out. When I questioned this I was told it was a “tax”. When I then asked one of the managers I was told it was a “mandatory charge”. They tried to explain that it covered WiFi and use of the gym (which I didn’t even know existed as nobody mentioned this at check-in and we therefore never used!). Charging for WiFi was bad enough until we were then asked for a further $5 per bag to store our baggage after checking out! They want to squeeze every last dollar out of you. Be warned. NEVER AGAIN. And Management… PLEASE do not reply with your usual copy/paste “Thank you for choosing to stay with us… we would like to investigate your claims and make any,1,1
"Two words sum up The Wyndham.. Noisy and Basic. The room was small and dated but clean, I’m sure it had not been modernised for some time. If you want to enjoy NYC you are going to need a decent nights sleep and you won’t be getting that in room 2179. The windows may as well not be there as they are not keeping any sound out at all, even on the 21st floor all you hear during the night is sirens, garbage trucks emptying dumpsters, construction work and whatever else is going on in NYC, at times if thought my bed was in the street.  There was a little museum in the basement which was interesting and showed the hotel in it heyday. A good location but I won’t be going back.  The Wyndham charges ‘Facility fees’ (as do many others in NYC), these are nothing less than a scam, $31.75",2,1
"We have previously stayed here, and it was always 3-4 stars.   It has taken a decided downhill turn.   They charge for EVERYTHING!  Want early check in?  $50.   Late check out?  Same.  Or a 'deal' at $75 for both.  What happened to accommodating a customer?   Our room online was NOTHING like our actual room.   It was a tiny box, with stained walls, cracked tiles in the bathroom, burn marks on the furniture- generally, a run down flop house.  The hallway carpets were held together with strips of duct tape.   DO NOT order ""room service""!  It comes from the diner attached to the hotel, and it is dreadful.   Cold by the time it arrives, the burgers were a burger in that they were shaped like one....but tasted like some non-meat byproduct with soggy old french fries on the side",2,1
"Needed to modify my reservation as a speaker at a conference on site. The phone rep canceled it, then transferred me to reservations to make a new reservation without telling me. At that point I was told there were no rooms. The next three days I attempted to contact any possible manager to fix this. (Again, I was a presenter at a conference they were hosting and flying from across the country!) Megan Buckhorn (sp?) was the only manager I was told could help. I called two days in a row and left two voicemails on her vm. I never heard back. Called from the airport terrified that I'd fly into NY late that night to have nowhere to stay! NO ONE helped and the manager still hadn't called. When I showed up, they said my reservation showed as ""canceled"" but put me in a room. The room",1,1
"Beware, this hotel charges an exhaubabent ""facilities"" charge per night.  FACILITIES include wi-fi, does anyone still charge for this?? And for use of their gym facilities. We didn't use these but still we were charges. Very disappointing.",1,1
"Stayed here for business for one night. While location is convenient near Penn Station, that's about it. Rooms are TINY and very noisy! I mean, I couldn't pull the chair from under the desk enough to sit down. The wifi was so bad, I couldn't do any work (emails mostly), forget getting on VPN. I gave up at some point and decided to do emails on the phone but my cell signal was just as bad. No music, no water, no coffee in the room, the bathroom shelf was so narrow, I couldn't keep my hairbrush on it without falling, never mind a little cosmetic bag. They charge $5 for storing bags for a couple hours - told me it was the requirement of the City of NY. BS! I come to NY for business every three weeks and always stay in different hotels, never ever was I charged for leaving bags",2,1
We stayed here for 2 nights following a cruise. The hotel has a good location for getting around Manhattan but that is the only good thing to say. The room was tiny you had to open the suitcase on the bed as there was no room on the floor. I have been to New York 4 times before but this was the only hotel with no coffee maker in the room and I was told I’d have to pay 28 dollars plus tax for the use of one. Also as we arrived early it was $50 to get the room even though it was available. The room was on the 36th floor and the soundproofing from the windows was appalling. The area around penn station is also not very nice. We have stayed in much better super 8 motels with better facilities. There are so many nicer hotels in New York than this one that are also much cheaper. Had,1,1
"The room was tiny, as were the beds. The bathroom was primitive, also tiny, but at least clean. The location, for many things, is good. The attached cafe is quite good, although our room did not include breakfast.  On leaving, the bill, after the Room Charge, and the various state and city taxes and fees, had a ""Facility Fee"" of nearly 15% of the total up to then, plus tax on that! This unadvertised fee, not included in the Hotels.com listing we booked through, is fully unwarranted, as we used no ""facility"" other than the room! This is fraud and theft.",2,1
"I stayed in room 2174, which was the size of a postage stamp. the shower head was leaking and pushing water up on the ceiling, the bed was really a hammock and the TV did work right. On top of that there is NO room service, no refrigerator in the room, and they charge you a ""RESORT FEE"" of $34 a day!!! The hotel is in need of a major upgrade! I was there for a conference so I did not select it but I would not go back to the conference if they choose this hotel.  Avoid this property because you will be disappointed.",1,1
"This hotel is absolutely dreadful! I was so disappointed. On a positive note the reception is beautiful and the location is good. The furniture in the room is ok, but the decor is tired and worn, layers and layers of paint, broken plugs, thread bare carpets, dirty grouting in the bathroom and no tea and coffee making facilities. We had to change rooms three times in total, the first was all of the above, but small and oppressive with the window looking on to a brick wall. The second and third slightly bigger, however the third room didn't improve cosmetically, but the view was amazing - The Empire State building, this was the only positive. The iron blow up and the toilet overflowed, insufficient towels etc, I could go on and on. I found the staff with the exception of Kada,",1,1
"After a not so comfortable flight and a stressful experience at JFK, we were looking forward to getting to the hotel that promised top notch service, beautiful rooms and fabulous views.  Well....  We were checked in by Lynn who I don’t think could have cared less about us if she tried. There were 4 of us in total; two couples and my friend had crutches. There was no “hello. Welcome. How are you? How was your journey?” or anything of the sort. She was incredibly rude right from the off when answering the simplest of queries and it seemed like everything was a real chore for her. There was another guest next to us who was making a complaint to a different receptionist and I saw her and Lynn exchange signs of exasperation and rolling their eyes between each other. I have never",2,1
"Upon arrival at the hotel the reception theythought we had arrived a day late and said we were a no show!! Thankfully we had our original booking paperwork to provide evidence that we had arrived on time - the member of staff didn’t like it that we had proved him wrong and his entire attitude changed towards us. He then left us standing at the reception whilst he seemingly worked wonders to find us a room. This is when it got interesting, the so called room, more like a cupboard with 2 double beds for myself, wife and 2 kids. The room window was a small single window facing a brick wall, so much for beautiful views eh!!! I called reception to complain and the rudeness of the member of staff baffled me, basically we were told he could not get us any other room and to call back in",1,1
"I was excited for this hotel due to its proximity to Madison Square Garden. When we arrived, I was happy to see the lobby was beautiful and the front desk staff was very friendly. However, when we got to our first room, it was way too small and we immediately requested a larger room. We did pay an upgrade fee and were moved to a larger room. However- this room was not very clean. The decor was old and dusty and there was black mold around the bathtub and window in the bathroom. We were so uncomfortable that we ended up checking out at midnight without getting any sleep, and just made the 3 hours trip back home. Upon checkout, no one thought it odd to ask why we were leaving so early, but again, the desk clerk was very friendly. I went online to provide this feedback to Wyndham",2,1
"Stayed for 3 nights, where do I start, after coming from a stay in Vegas and San Francisco we found the rooms tiny/ cramped to say the least! We complained and were  told this is normal for New York?  If we required larger it's 75 dollars extra per night! As per previous review the art deco lobby is nice but always full of people. We were charged 5 dollars to store our case's after checkout having spent over 200 dollars per room x2 for 3 nights I would expect this to be free? Great location next to Penn Station in heart of Manhattan. Very disappointed !",1,1
"This was by far one of my worst hotel experiences - from the moment of arriving to the moment of leaving. I booked my room through booking.com and got possibly the worst room in the hotel. The room was shabby, smelly, the size of a sardine can and looked on to a concrete wall. Luckily, the one kind and empathetic staff member, Michael at the Front Desk, heard my pain when I complained that I couldn't fold out my suitcase because the room was so tiny, so he moved me to a slightly larger, renovated room. There seems to be a two track system whereby a reservation through booking.com doesn't get you a renovated room. In addition, as I was checking in at 12:30pm, I was asked if I wanted my room (which was ready) right away. However, that came with a $50 price tag (before tax), which",2,1
"At a recent stay, I was not informed of a $29 Facility Fee before hand.  Apparently it is for internet, phone and exercise room.  Of course, as a Rewards member, I get free internet, do not use the phone and did not have time to visit the exercise room.    Please be aware that you will likely get charged for this -- no matter what price you believe you have negotiated.",1,1
"They have a counter near the front desk where the people behind it are trying to get people to Wyndham timeshare presentations. The problem is they did not actually inform us exactly what they were selling! They advised us that we would be going to a new Wyndham hotel in New York and reviewing that hotel. There was nothing mentioned about selling timeshare. They say you will get breakfast so you think you will get a decent breakfast at the new hotel however you are taken to the Wyndham office and given an awful breakfast.  As for the New Yorker Hotel room we had, the hot water in the shower was weak and we could not dial out using the phone. Atleast we got 50% off the “resort” fees for this. This is not a resort style hotel.",2,1
Would never go again. We were treated like the bumbs on the street corner. Our family were only in New York for one day and they ruined our whole day with their lengthy check in process. They then lied and said they were giving us a room with a view and pull out bed and we even had to switch rooms after 2 hours. This was the worse experience ever and hotel was gross!!!,1,1

"Here are the negatives from my recent stay  Building is VERY old and therefore noisy, toilets and taps running all hours of the night sounding like a jet is next door  Walls were randomly vibrating very loud, the first time being 3am which petrified us. Pipes or air con I assume   Compulsory fee is a rip off, all sections should be optional and if you want to use the gym you pay for it. We HAD to pay for gym, calls (in 2019??), business suite and WiFi when we didn’t need any of them, $44 per day when Vodafone charge £5 per day on world traveller.....  I mentioned in the booking and via email that this trip was for my partners 30th but they did nothing special.

Right I will start with the good things the security and tick tick diner staff where lovely the WiFi and great tv channels clean bed linen good water hot and pressure good heating in a   lovely Art Deco style with lots of history now the bad when we arrived we were given a room saying it was a upgrade because it had Empire State views the room was number 3719 we got on their was one small window damp walls mucky and smelt of damp so we went down stairs to a lady tutting well for tonight I’m not sure with a long pause she handed another key card to us with a smirky happy birthday we went back up to room 2301 it had its bad bits but looked better than the other with two bathrooms I have enclosed pictures it’s so weird you had to squeeze round the bed or stand on the bed to look,2,1
"I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, especially when there are so many great choices available for accommodations in NYC. We stayed here for 6 days and it felt like an eternity. The first room we were placed in was extremely musty and the decor was very dated. I felt as though we had been placed in a room that hadn't been used in a while or something... There was a thin layer of grime on the bathroom floor that made me wish I had brought a pair of shower shoes with me. We eventually asked to be placed in a different room, and the room they moved us to was probably half the size of our original room, but I will say that it wasn't as dusty. The decor in general throughout the hotel needs to be redone, I'm guessing it's all probably 20 years old or something. The only",2,1
It’s only my first night here and I’m already disappointed. Firstly the charge of $31 per day just to use their facilities. To have coffee/tea facility in your room there is an extra charge! On top of that the room is very outdated. The bathroom is old and rusty. Beds are not comfortable at all. The only upside is the location and the view of the Empire State Building.  The hotel desperately needs renovating.  Will definitely  not be choosing this hotel next time I visit NYC,2,1
"I am booked on a trip to NYC which will stay at the New Yorker hotel from May 5-12. I want to book a room for May 4.

Based on this response, I would never stay here except that in this case I have no choice. Complete incompetence.",1,1

"I booked two rooms for one night at ""The New Yorker"" using a trip advisor link. One room for my wife and I and one room for our friends from Zambia who we were taking into NYC to see a play and do some sightseeing. I chose the New Yorker for three reasons: 1. Price; 2. Location; and 3. the advertised fact that the hotel had a bar/lounge on one of the upper floors with a great view.  What a rip off. I was quoted with my triple AAA discount a rate of $359.16 for both rooms with free wifi. The actual cost we paid was $597.04. In addition to the NY sales tax and NY city hotel tax which I expected there was an occupancy tax, a NYC hotel unit fee, a mandatory $29 Facility fee ( so you could have the ""FREE"" wifi), a Non-Room Tax NY state sales tax fee,  and a Non-Room Tax NYC sales",1,1
"Other than the location close to Madison Square Garden this hotel fall far short of any reasonable expectations. The property is beyond tired - it’s not being maintained. In my room there was water damage on the ceiling, cracks in the walls, mismatched tiles in the bathroom floor, mold in the shower and the tv didn’t work. I called about the tv and no one ever came. Maybe there’s hope - there’s a surprise $29 facility fee tacked onto the bill, as part of the incidentals charged to the room. Maybe the hotel operator is using that as a funding source for the badly required renovations. Until that’s completed I’m going to stay away.",2,1
"We had an executive view double room.  We were told when we booked that these rooms had undergone a complete renovation.  That was very questionable.  The shower leaked all over the floor.  We put towels down to soak up the water.  The sink was so small you couldn't turn the faucet on more than 1/4 or the water ran over the sides of the sink. Apparently the shower was also leaking into the room beneath us also because we were told we had to move rooms because of a mechanical problem.  What a pain to have to pack, move, unpack again. At least they upgraded us to a suite with a view.  We liked this room until 5am the following morning when we were awakened by water hammer noise coming from the room above us.  It sounded like a jet engine in the room! The day we checked out there",2,1
"This was my first time visiting New York along with 1 other friend and this hotel and hospitality was incredibly disappointing. Months before arriving, we had requested two twin beds, but when we arrived in reception, we were informed that if we wanted twin beds it would cost $20 extra per night.   We knew the queen bed would not be big enough for two adults with a lot of luggage, so we agreed. When we go to the room we were incredibly disappointed. The room was very, dated and was also the smallest twin room I have ever seen (I appreciate that the rooms in a city hotel won't be as big as other places). The bathroom was very dirty, the tub was peeling, shower curtain was impractical- everything in that bathroom was a big NO. The view was of the back of a brick building. No view",2,1
"I have been staying at the New Yorker for the past twenty years or so, and it has always been my home in New York City.  When the Ramada chain owned it, it was a fantastic place to spend a weekend, or in fact, a week or more! Since Wyndham has taken over,  the quality of service has taken a nosedive! This past weekend I was told that I had to pay for an early check-in, something that I had come to expect as a regular customer when it was available. I booked a ""view suite"" which turned out to have absolutely no view, and was VERY tiny! The refrigerator door was broken and was sagging down. Heat was inconsistent and difficult to manage.

When we booked the accommodation it clearly stated check in available from 3pm, we arrived at around 3.30pm. Waited in line only to be told that our room wasn’t ready. No problem if you would like to pay for a room upgrade. So we received the up selling routine.  We were tired from travelling so agreed the added fee over $100. Once my credit card had be swiped the guy on reception informed us that the previous guests had only just left, so that room wasn’t ready either.

Standard rooms have enough floor space for your suitcase that’s it, reception and lobby is as basic as you can get for what could be a very good iconic hotel. But in truth it’s a 2 star poor hotel in a good location.   A real shame this is sold with high expectations by many companies, pay a little more and get a nice modern hotel",2,1
Canceled my reservation weeks before reservation. One night’s stay was charged to my credit card. I have a cancellation number but was told I needed the name of the person who took the cancellation.

After staying at a B and B my first trip to ny (pleasure), and at the Martinique on Broadway (westminister dog show stay) I thought a 4 star a little closer to Madison and Times Square would be amazing. I had two free nights with my rewards and paid for the other two nights. When I made my reservations I asked them to note that we had a dog in the room that is a therapy dog, I was advised the dog would be exempt from cleaning fees if I provided proof (no problem! Got that from St. John ambulance). I asked for an accessible room for more space. With a dog you can only book a metro room.

No remarkable perks or bonuses.  They charge to hold your bag, which at a budget hotel is ok I guess, but why not include that service in the facilities fee as it's about the only one I'll use?

I had previously emailed the hotel asking for a refurbished room on a high floor to which I got a reply stating this would happen. On checking in this wasn’t the case we was on floor 8 with no view at all, the bedroom was very small not big enough at all for 2adults and 2children, we just had to make doo as was told couldn’t do anything else as no other rooms available. Whenever we used the shower is flooded the whole of the bathroom and into the bedroom area, this was",2,1
"Stayed for one week at the New Yorker Hotel. Good things were location and Tick Tock Diner. Not so good was the first room we stayed in, which was right next to a supply cupboard and  very noisy at night as well as some noise from outside. Also, the decor in this room was very dated with paint peeling off the bottom of the bathroom door and the door looking rotten in some places. Also. there was a really, and I mean really, cold draft coming through the seals around the edge of the double glazed windows.  We asked to be moved the following day and were moved to a room 6 storeys higher,  same size room, but again very draughty around the double glazing so much so that we had to request a spare Quilt to try and block the draft from the window, as well as an additional quilt for",2,1
First of all the tap water is so dirty so showering was out of the question (see photo). Paid for a suite - three people got one bed?!? What are they thinking in the reception. Never paid so much for such poor quality.,1,1
"When we arrived late at night they knew it would be three of us, we booked a suite *wow* and payed almost $500 for one night, when we came to the room we had one bed and one pullout bed that wasn’t even made so we had to call room service and they came 45 mins later. Got the feeling of walking into a hotel room like 50 years ago. Yellow and brown sofas, the curtains.... just no. The rooms are bad, and the carpet is really not ok. I really don’t wanna know what’s been on that one... This hotel needs a renovation, ASAP! Wouldn’t recommend to anyone and will not come back. One thing that’s good is that beds are comfy.",2,1
"I have stayed here before and had a wonderful time. This time was horrible. The first night our hotel key didn’t work. Instead of changing the cards like the security guy said they made us change rooms. They told us we would be upgraded. Our room was the exact same with a worse view. Second night, keys don’t work again. Third night, keys don’t work again. Absolutely ridiculous when you are paying a “resort fee,” plus $70 for parking per night. Will not be staying here again.",1,1
"At first appearance the lobby looks nice, very Art Deco. At reception when booking in we was told about the room tax being $23 per night, when asked what it was for we was told for the WiFi. I asked if there was water and drinks in the room and was told no it was extra. Having traveled from the uk I was quite disappointed by this. The room tax seemed to be unneeded really. When we caught the lift to our floor and got out you could see it really did need redecorating, we was on floor 28. We opened the door to our room to almost trip on the bed!. Thankfully it was just for sleeping in as it was rather small dated and the bathroom was worse!. We nearly scalded ourselves in the shower as getting the water temperature right was nearly impossible, towels were very small but clean and",2,1
"Guys, I hate to complain, but felt compelled to do so in this case. Just overall bad experience for me so far. Been here for one night only so far.   First impression: This is not uncommon in NYC, but the size of this standard Queen Bed room is very small. Basically, I felt like I was walking into a walk in closet. This doesn't bother me so much as I am here to sleep and attend a convention at Javits. (Which is  short walk away)   Room is outdated and unclean: I'm not sure when the last time these rooms were renovated, but a little facelift wouldn't hurt. Carpets, tiles and furniture look like they were pulled from the ""Casino"" movie set. You know the one with DeNiro in it. The bathroom knob is rusty and when you look at the floor, it's hard to distinguish whether the floor is",2,1
"Beautiful lobby, not indicative of things to come. Staff where friendly. Hotel corridors, lifts etc where very tired and grubby. Well worn.  Room was freezing ! But it was February in a cold snap so hey ho. However, the bathroom was a different thing altogether sub zero temps. No heating at all in there. Old and utilitarian. It is central but I would forgo that for a coffee machine or a bottle of water in the room. The WiFi IS NOT COMPLIMENTARY AS STATED, ITS AN EYE WATERING $22 a night !!!  This included use of the gym and business facilities ??? On a birthday trip and I’m a disabled elderly mum. But still paid for use of the gym !! I was told, rather patronisingly , it’s there if you want it m’am Non negotiable😡.  We could have had a coffee maker in the room  for $25 a night.",2,1
"Front Desk and any other person who answered the phone was just shuffling me around instead of trying to help answer questions. Staff was unable to change any reservations that I made online without an email even though I made the effort to call and confirm changes. Overall the booking and confirmation process and dealing with staff over the phone was the worst experience I've had in the ""hospitality"" industry.",1,1
Rooms are very old. Especially bathroom. Very noisy too. Never use valet parking.they charge additional 40% fee and they do not say. You learn when you are paying it. Beds are old small. Very good place though.,1,1

"My husband and I stayed here last May, had a great view from our room.  The 'art deco' bathroom was very small and basic.  I emailed before we arrived in New York to request tea making facilities in our room (I am British!) and was told they couldn't offer this, for a very large in hotel in New York I think this was poor service.",2,1
"Is one of the WORST hotels I’ve stay in my life. The only good thing was the location because they have other hotels for better price. The bed was “king”, the water was only boiling hot or mega cold, and with the cold temperatures and my heater was not working. After this I complained to the front desk and her response was “My heater at home doesn’t work neither”  This is without adding that the room is not as they show in the picture. The room is small, everything is outdated with mold and rust.",1,1
Do not stay at this hotel. This was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a hotel and I travel weekly for business. On average I spend 3 nights a week in a hotel and this was literally the worst overall experience i have ever had.,1,1
"Great location and lobby staff. Kindly upgraded us due to a birthday. But problems with the most important thing: wasn’t clean. Visible dust/dirt layers on tops of tile, baseboards, bathroom light, debris on floor found when opened curtains.  Housekeeping didn’t come to clean the room first day. Linens were clean though. A clean room is standard and mandatory as far as I am concerned. Seems like a management problem.",2,1
"Staying in room 2621. Minute double, dated and noisy with paper thin walls. You pay a mandatory 22 dollars per room per day service charge extra for free wifi , telephone calls and conference facilities that nobody uses or has on their phone anyway. RIP off and certainly not recommended. No view. , The hotel location is convenient but then, so are many others.",2,1
"Glad it was only a two night stay, would not like to stay ant longer in the mouse hole bedroom. Charged for amenities not used. Would definitely not recommend this hotel. Lovely reception area all downhill from there.",1,1
"Stayed for one night in November 2018 (reservation was for two nights).  I booked this hotel because of its convenient location to Penn Station and decent rate.  In this case, I learned I was really getting what I paid for.  When I checked in, another guest was checking out and complaining about brown water coming out of the faucet.  My room seemed well appointed, although I found a window that was letting cold air in and would not shut.  Maintenance came and fixed this problem.    In the morning, I turned on the shower, hopped in, and noticed brown water flowing down my body (I wasn't that dirty).  Same problem with the sink (see attached photo).  The hotel offered me another room, which I probably would have accepted had it not been for another guest complaining of the same",2,1
I have received spam calls from Wyndham resorts as a result of my having stayed at The New Yorker. I think people should know that staying at The New Yorker can result in annoying future phone calls trying to sell you a Wyndham vacation.,1,1
"This hotel is not recommended at all.   Those guys at the reception have an attitude problem. They locked us out of the room and authorized the credit card without notifying us, claiming that they left us a message in the room (which we weren’t allowed to enter anyways).   His argument was you haven’t stayed in a hotel in the US before and you don’t know the protocol. This comment is extremely offensive from a guest service manager and in our case is not true. That’s our 4th or 5th hotel in the US and the WORST of all by far !",1,1
"Room size was horrible maybe 12 X 12. Shower leak all night, made housekeeping aware of the problem was never corrected.  Vanity space maybe 5 or 6 inch  very very tiny bathroom.  Horrible for the price that was paid over $500.00 New Years weekend.  will never stay at this place again. really deceiving  lobby is elegant",1,1
"Firstly, the location of this place is great. And that’s where the positive comments end. Upon arrival we were greeted by a receptionist with an awful attitude problem. The hotel was booked for 5 people, however we were only given a room with 2 double beds.. when we asked the receptionist to sort this out, she went on to blame Booking.com for the error, stating it was their fault and we should contact them. Sorry but this hotel is trusting Booking.com to make bookings on their behalf, therefore it’s up to the hotel to resolve any issues.  The room was spacious however very poorly maintained (see attached photo). There was rust leaking down the wall into the bath (disgusting). The room cleaner must notice this every day when cleaning the bath but still no one has been sent out to",1,1
"Travelled here over the Xmas period. The hotel lobby was nice but the rest of the hotel felt very dated and could do with a lot of TLC. The room itself was pretty small and the bathroom laid out very awkwardly. TV was meant to have ""Premium Channels"" but there was not a lot to choose from and the quality was fuzzy. 2 out of the 4 nights we stayed our room wasn't cleaned despite leaving a 'Please Clean' note on the door which was very annoying. We'd payed extra to have a room with a view. The room was on a higher floor but the view was disappointing. Looked on to a building in front of us and dirty balcony below, if you looked far to you right you could see the Hudson river through some buildings. So definitely wasn't worth the extra month.  The heating was very noisy so had to",2,1
I have to admit the location is brilliant 10mins from times square and 20 mins from central park.  Short 1hour walk will take you downtown. Upon arrival at the hotel you will be charged a service charge which is 22 dollers per day ! Along with a whopping 175doller charge for your stay depending how long you are there.  After your stay advised they will refund you the money and send a receipt.  It has been 1 week since we have arrived back to the UK iv had no receipt I did get my refund but then they have taken it back of me so I am still out of pocket by £135 (currency change) I have emailed them and had no responce my only option is to review for a responce!! Not a happy customer considering I paid nearly £2000  for my trip to new york.,1,1
Currently staying at this hotel and would not recommend to anyone.  The rooms are tiny and very dirty. Myself and partner( who has asthma) are very irritated by the dust in the room. We expected a small room but there is nowhere to put your clothes apart from a disgusting set of drawers and tiny cupboard which I wouldn’t dream of putting my belongings in.  The maids are extremely rude! with the amount of noise they make. They were talking very loudly outside our room at 8.30am this morning. We aren’t usually long sleepers but we had an early start the day before and were hoping to sleep a little later this morning.   Currently one maid is cleaning out a room next to us after a couple have moved out. It’s after 9pm at night and the noise is EXTREMELY irritating as she is in and,1,1

"We have previously stayed at this hotel twice before for one week at a time and absolutely loved it. After a long flight- the same as everyone, we couldn’t wait to get into our room and settle. Upon arrival, the room was extremely cold, it felt like a window was wide open when they were all shut. The room was very small, we had previously stayed in a suite for more people so we expected it to be smaller but this was tiny. The “doors” joining the bedroom and the living room were not sufficient and they may as well not have been there. We decided to seek assistance at the check in desk and see what the hotel could offer. We first spoke to Miguel who was very polite and could clearly understand our concerns. He then went to fetch the manager, Jason, who was polite - at first. Jason",1,1
"This is an amazing historic property. We ended up in the Tesla room, where Nikola Tesla lived and died. I was so honored to be randomly assigned this room. Everything was wonderful expect the water temperature. The shower went from pleasant to scalding and then to freezing. We stayed there for three days and I was honestly too scarred to wash my hair for fear of a severe burn. I mentioned it to the front desk and I was told that the building is very old with very old plumbing and it was common to have inconsistencies in temperature.",2,1
"It was a great stay until it wasn’t. On the last day of our stay, we requested and paid for valet parking for an extra night while we explored the city so that our car would be in a secure facility. That night, we texted to retrieve our car at 7:47 and when we arrived in the lobby at 7:54 our car was already out front. Seems fast right? Wrong. Turns out our car in it’s ‘secure facility’ had been sitting in the road for more than an hour because they had supposedly had a call about it. But the room number and ticket provided by the valet did not match our ticket, even though it was our car. On top of that, the valet didn’t even initially ask for our ticket, they just handed us keys to the car because we said it was ours. There was nothing to prevent them from giving the keys to",1,1
"We pre-paid for a December NYC trip to see the city at Christmas and attend shows. BIG mistake. We were not allowed to check in until 8:30pm on our arrival day. We kept getting different stories from management about why this was, and one of the excuses was guests doing very late checkouts. (when I inquired about a late checkout on our departure day, they told us it was 1pm which is only an extra hour. so, New Yorker management, how late were these other guests allowed to stay...)It was incredibly inconvenient because we had dinner reservations but no place to change clothes, use the restroom etc. The worst part was that management made NO effort to remedy the situation or compensate us for our trouble. The rooms we were promised were not what was delivered. Not much of a view",1,1
"Stayed for 3 nights last week. First off the good points. Hotel central and within walking distance of Penn Station, Macy's, Empire State Building, Times Square and a decent walk to Central Park. Bad Points. On checking in we where given the key cards to a room on the 28th floor (2821), to say we where disappointed would be an under statement. It was the smallest room we have ever stayed in and would have been small for just 1 person with a single bed. It was so small that I had to lift our case over the bed to get it in the wardrobe (see photo). On complaining to reception we where offered a room on the 25th floor for the 2nd and 3rd nights provided we payed an upgrade which we did. This was an improvement but as with the first room it looked as though they needed a fresh coat",2,1
"Check in and check out are less then awesome at this property. I’ve been staying her for work as the price is decent, rooms are clean and in all honesty I’m only in the room to sleep. There is a small trattoria off the lobby, food is good and happy hour prices are great. What I will say is that the check in and out kind of sucks. I’ve stayed at this property a few times and it’s the same thing. Only 1-2 people on the desk and a line up to the door. Today a lady felt much more important then everyone and cut the line. When I said something to the employee that the woman should have been sent to the back of the line shoe told me she works for an airline and gets priority... my comment was that’s not right, we are all human and all of our time is important. I too am in tourism and",2,1
"We paid extra for City View and got a corner room with a view, but the size of a walk-in closet. Comfortable bed, clean linens, but old faucets made it hard to regulate heat in shower, either scalding or cold. Adequate closet space, but one torn chair, so heavy and cumbersome it served no purpose. Staff is friendly.",2,1
"I had a room on the 20th floor as did my colleague. I have stayed hotels all over the world and would never stay here again.   When the lift stopped at floors up to the 20th floor the corridors looked like a dodgy old American movie. Seems to house small businesses and community projects. Not a hotel at all.   The corridor between the lifts and our rooms were dingy and in need of a complete overhaul. It was actually quite creepy.   Staff were indifferent and I overheard some being extremely rude to guests unhappy with their charges. It seems some ‘extras’ are added on without notice.   The bedroom was tiny and in a poor state of repair. I could not believe the condition of the bathroom. Photos attached.   One morning, I went downstairs from the lobby to use the washroom. They",1,1
"Good points- good location,clean room,comfy bedBad points- stayed 4 nights and was charged an extra £100 for use of the facilities ( which we didn't use) as when we checked in we were given a white card holding our 2 key cards and apparently this was our acceptance of these charges which were most definitely NOT explained by thr receptionist checking us in!!!!",2,1
"A disappointing stay. The rooms are small, very dated, dark, no amenities. The hotel is busy and crowded with waits for reception and even bag check. The location is not great - busy and noisy part of town, limited good restaurants near by, far from good places to visit like museums, Central Park, etc.Can do much better at other hotels.",2,1
"Overall, I was not satisfied with my stay. When I was reserving the hotel, it showed a price of 220 per night and I was so excited to try this out. After I reserved and got the final receipt, I saw a slew of taxes + a facility fee of $30 each day for stuff I did not use! The facility fee should have been included upfront in room rate for sake of transparency. The breakfast at $20 was below average at best, and there was no amenities in the room - No microwave, no fridge, no bathroom counter to keep stuff on. Heck - not even a shower cap and shower gel (who uses soap cakes now, really?). The flush didn't drain properly and adjusting the shower head to get medium hot water was sucha task! I called the reception desk to request an iphone charger (since the lobby and the 36th floor",1,1
"This hotel has been around a long time and despite renovations is weary. The decor in the room was dull and beige.  My room did not have a good view and was dreary and dismal, not much light was let in from the window.    While the bedding was new and updated, the furniture seemed old and dated.    The worst aspect of the room was the plumbing and heating controls.  The dual hot and cold water controls in the shower were unstable and hard to control.  It resulted in the temperature vacillating from scalding hot to freezing cold.  The tub surround also had been updated with new tile, but the tub was old and worn in appearance.  It took an extra ten minutes to take a shower to maintain the water at a comfortable temperature.  The room was drafty and it felt like turning the heat",2,1
"I was not a guest of the New Yorker Wyndam Hotel; however, I was so disappointed by the hotel staff that I will never stay there. My husband was staying there on business, which happened to overlap with his birthday. In the 18 years, we have been together, we have never been apart on his birthday. As a surprise, I wanted to send something to his room on his birthday to let him know I was thinking about him. I have done similar surprises when we have traveled together, so I know it’s a common request.  I called the hotel around noon the day before and asked to speak with the concierge. I was transferred, and it went to voicemail. I left a message with a brief explanation of my request and my phone number. I did not hear back, so around 2:30 I called back. Someone answered the",1,1
"I am a travel agent and recently had 2 clients come and stay in this hotel. They are very laid back clients. But they called me at 6:00 AM to explain to me that they were in the middle of a disaster. While they paid for an extra night to be able to check in early, they were denied early check in. Even though they had bought the room for that night. They were denied because it was still an 'early check in' which they couldn't do. They were finally let into their room hours later. Only to discover it was the wrong room. And even  though it was not the room on the reservation, they still had to pay $275 to upgrade rooms. And not to mention, he had to deal with the rudest staff ever. They then charged him twice (on 2 different cards somehow!) for his meal at the restaurant. Then",1,1
"I booked this hotel in November, taking the time to speak to someone on the phone and booking as such.  I made it clear that I needed a suite with 2 bathrooms and a kitchenette area.  We had 4 adults and a teenager in our party.  The room they gave us first, had one bathroom and hardly enough room to move around in.  I made it clear that this was NOT what I booked.  They then gave us a room with 2 bathrooms.  There was no kitchenette area - not even a coffee maker.  When the sofa was pulled out, it took up the entire sitting area.  The paint was chipping off of the doors and the hinges were all rusted.  The room was unbelievably drafty!  When I called to speak to a manager, he told me that I was already upgraded at no charge and there was nothing more he could do.  This was NOT",1,1
"While the check-in and breakfast lounge staff were friendly and helpful, this place is really part it’s heyday. I stayed there for a last minute business trip because it was the cheapest chain hotel in NY even remotely near my meetings, but I’d gladly fork over an extra $200 next time to stay somewhere without cracked tiles in bathroom, chipped painting and just gross infrastructure. Bedding and all was fine but slept kinda skeeved out.",2,1
"When checking in we were offered a higher floor room but warned that it was a much smaller room. With that in mind we declined the offer. What we were given was a room barely large enough to fit the bed in. Thinking we had been mistakenly given a lower grade room we contacted reception twice to confirm and were told this was indeed correct. What size the smaller room was is anybody’s guess but this room was not large enough for both of us to get dressed in at once. Only one side of the bed had enough room left over for a table.   There were six taps in the bathroom; two in the sink, four in the bath servicing both the bath and the shower. All of them dispensed piping hot water. Upon request the hotel tried to address this and eventually we were able to get a reasonable shower",1,1
"We wanted a queen bed which I reserved online. Then, my son joined us and I called the hotel to arrange for a room that could accommodate a roll-away bed. Apparently, the rooms are so small that a special room had to be selected that could accommodate the roll-away bed. When we arrived, there was no special room reserved for us. The staff at the front desk kept asking ""what was the name of the person you spoke with?"" as if that could make the room appear. In the end, we got a room with two double beds and virtually no window and various explosive sounds from other rooms, including a constant ventilation noise. With the $62 required, daily fee added for ""free overseas phone calls, free internet, use of the fitness center, and taxes, I wouldn't stay here again. I had loved it",2,1
What a depressing place.  We had to get a last minute hotel in midtown and this was close.  It seems like a rent by the hour hotel.  We stayed downstairs until it was time to sleep because the room was so horrible,2,1
"Me & my partner stayed for 3 nights in the New Yorker. Basic hotel. Lovely building in its heyday. The decor could definitely do with updating. Staff mediocre.  Bedroom was small, but done the job. It was clean which was the most important thing for us. The rooms on floor 32 where we were, are located quite close together so be prepared to hear other guests talking, opening & closing doors. The street noise wasn’t too bad, the odd siren here and there, but you’d expect that in NYC. The $29 a day charge is ridiculous and non negotiable. The location is fantastic and for that I’d stay here again. I would completely avoid the yellow taxis outside the hotel and in New York generally.. Uber all the way. Clean, friendly, courteous & nice cars, as opposed to the shoddy, dented,",2,1
"I would suggest bypassing this hotel.  Checking in took forever.  My room was barely large enough for the bed and I could hardly walk around from one side to the other since the desk chair was in the way and there was no place else to put it.  Whatever, I dealt with it.  But when I woke up in the morning to take a shower before my meeting and had no hot water, that was unacceptable.  I let the water run for a full 20 minutes while standing there sticking my fingers in every few minutes all to no avail.  I ended up having to go to my meeting without taking a shower!  It was horrible.  Not the hotel's fault, but I also had someone try to come into my room.  Since the door was right next to the bed, it felt as though they were already in my room and incredibly intrusive.  Oh, and",1,1

We received an invoice from our booking partner and when our credit card was billed we were billed extras when I questioned what these were I was advised that there are facilities charges wifi that to be honest did not work in the room or in the lobby this is a compulsory charge, whether you use the facilities or not, it should be added to the cost of the room as it really felt like a sneaky extra at the end of our trip. these charges were not factured into our spending for the few days we were there and these hidden charges were added at the end of our holiday please be aware of these hidden charges.

"My fiancé and I travelled to NY for my birthday and I have to say I was surprised with how poor this hotel was. The location is good. It’s next to Penn station allowing easy access to the subway. Also within walking distance is the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, Port authority bus station, Macy’s. My biggest issue with the hotel was its cleanliness. I wasn’t expecting anything special based on other reviews, the hotel is in dire need of a refurbishment with paint peeling off the walls and very old window frames that allow the cold in (it was -6 the day we left and the room was cold when we woke up, though there is an old noisy heater that can be switched on). For all of its cosmetic deficiencies (which I can get over) I would expect a clean room. Not the case. Thick",2,1
"First, the hotel is really old but so convenient. The room was very small but adequate for most of our needs.We just made sure we didn't make any sudden movements. We were provided the room by our tour operator, Road Scholars. Since we were going to be in NYC after the tour ended, we extended our stay but in a corner suite on a much higher level. This room had many windows/views, but interestingly it had a ""patio"" that was almost walled in, so one had to stand to see over the edge. Should we ever consider staying here again, we think we'd choose one floor down so we didn't have a totally useful patio blocking some of our view. While convenient to the subway, Penn Station was right next door, we regretted not going back to an earlier hotel that we loved. That was the WestHouse",2,1

We did not upgrade Thankgod as it would of cost another 130 odd dollars ! The room on the 22 floor was actually ok to be fair but the shower was awful. At best a warm mist came out in the morning and by 7pm only cold water was available, luckily we were only staying for three nights.   The door staff were lovely and the tick tock dinner meal and staff really great.  However lasting impressions again of reception staff who seemed to not want to give back a room desposit of an upgrade we did not have. This was sorted in the end and I will be keeping an eye on my credit card to make sure ! We",2,1

"We stayed here because of the location.  Our first night was on the 23rd floor.  The tv didn’t work, the faucets dripped all night, the bed was really only a double not a queen, the neighbors fought all night long, & the road noise was horrible.  Not to mention that the room was tiny!  I asked to be moved, the next night was better but the tv didn’t work & the bathroom sink didn’t drain.  Very old section—request lower floors.",2,1
"The only saving grace for this hotel is it's location. We travelled by train from Montreal to NYC and this hotel is almost opposite Penn Station. I was previously aware of the 'Facility fee' though Internet research and our travel agent got this removed from our prepaid bill. The hotel say this is a mandatory fee to cover WiFi, phone calls, gym and online check in for airlines. We needed none of these. My wife needed a refrigerator which was $20 but this was waived as it was required for medical reasons. Despite asking for this prior to our stay it wasn't delivered to our room until the second night of our stay. Our room (a twin room) was on the 34th floor. The corridor was dingy and smelt musty as did our room. The room was very small but at least we could move round the beds",1,1
"I generally try to overlook some things when I'm in a NYC hotel (I travel there frequently for work). I know the rooms will be tiny, and there will be street noise. But for a hotel of this rating, brand, and the reviews, I was severely disappointed with the facility.  I opted to try this hotel as it was next door to the building I was working in for the week. Check in was fine - I waited about 10 minutes, but that's not out of the ordinary for such a high volume place. There are a lot of elevator banks, which meant never having to wait too long. But entering the room, I was really surprised at how dated it was. Not only outdated, but also in poor condition. Turning on the sink, it would fill up quickly almost to the point of overflowing while washing my face quickly - the",2,1
"It's a big, old hotel in a great location, and it is also a rip off. Yes, it's close to a many great things in NYC, but it's expensive, very expensive for what you are getting. But worst of all, they have a hidden Facility Charge of $30 which is automatically added to your bill if you book through a 3rd party site. When asked about this, the clerk at the desk  said,, ""It covers your free wifi and the gym."" I didn't use the gym and if I am paying $30, then the wifi isn't free. She also said, ""You should have read the small print..."" Well, when a room costs hundreds of dollars a night, seems to me those little extras should be included. Long story short, I said I'd never stay there again. So, beware when you book, and read the small print, if you have an extra five hours to",1,1
"Chose the New Yorker for its location as I was taking my son to NYC for his first trip. naturally he was super excited, as would any 13 year old boy. We stayed from the 26/8/18 to 31/8/18. The hotel is situated in a good location close to Macys and having a metro station on its doorstep so you can get around. Check in staff are friendly and have a pleasant manor as they welcome you and process your check in. We had two rooms booked and were given rooms over looking the Hudson next door to each other, which was convenient for meeting when going out. Rooms were a good size and everything worked as it should. Overall we had a great time during our stay and had no problems with the room. On the morning of checkout, there was then usual invoice under the door for the local taxes",1,1
"Unfortunately we received confirmation for a different room above the 19th floor. We expected a small room, it is NYC. But we didn't expect a room where you could actually here everything that happened outside. Between the sirens, jack hammering and honking horns there was not one peaceful night. We were too close to the street on the 8th floor with absolutely no view of anything.",2,1
"OK, so this place is iconic and boasts some undeniably lovely original NY Art Deco touches in and around the lobby. The location for Penn and The Garden is great and if you get, or request,  the right room on a high floor you’ll get a Manhatten or New Jersey view to die for. But it ends there for me.   Firstly it’s vast, by my calculation over 1000 rooms, which results in long lines for the elevators (of which there are 12!) and reception at peak times. Don’t doubt they’re in a constant state of maintenance, but this high footfall also means, the floors themselves and certain aspects of the rooms are shabby; it could do with a refurb in fact.   On my most recent visit my key card kept failing, resulting in 5 minute round trips back down to reception (praying there wouldn’t be a",2,1
"It was notMy first time in this hotel and as last time I found the hotel getting a bit « old » I booked and prepaid for a Double Executive view room as it was described as « recently renovated room, with renovated bathroom and Nespresso coffe machine in the room »Unfortunately I didn’t get what I paid for, instead I got a Metro room (same as last time) . When I asked at the reception they explained me that this room was bigger than the executive one and then more convenient with my 2 kids.They propose me to bring me a coffee maker , I accepted but it was not a nespresso one ( bad coffe, really) . I asked to see an real executive room but it was not possible as none of them were free ! And they refused to refound the difference price between metro and executive !The bathroom was",2,1
"Positives: (1) Location if Penn Station is important (2) great little breakfast diner in the Tick Tock (3) art deco if you are into that. Negatives: (1) the day that I was there all reservation systems were down and they could not check in guests until in my case after 6 pm. It was sheer chaos with lines of 50 plus people. Apparently no redundancy in their systems. I had traveled 1500 miles and had a dinner meeting lined up at 6. So that eliminated any opportunity to get into the room. From observation, it seems like the check in process is repeatedly in chaos. (2) they hit you with a $40 per night ""resort fee"" which buys you exactly nothing except access to a fitness facility that is just poor. In my view it just seems like a way to inflate the room rates without being up front",2,1
"I'm used to travelling a lot, and I'm used to the New York prices too.  So, the price we paid was reasonable if we had a room of a decent size, which we clearly didn't. First, because the room was not ready at noon, we could actually get in at 4PM. Travelling with my wife and 2 young children, we booked a room with 2 beds. We barely could put our 2 suitcases + the baby stroller in the room... and when we did, we had to walk on the beds to go from one side to the bathroom. The beds were small (140cm) and basically: no place at all on the floor. We had a small portable baby crib for our little one, for which there was absolutely no space at all.  The sound isolation is catastrophic: you hear your neighbors go to the bathroom or take their shower, and there was no way to adjust the",1,1
"Came here hopig for nice vacations, but the hotel is just bad. Terrible shower temperature, very hot or very cold and constantly changing on it's own. There's an alarm that was set for 6 am, we never asked for that since it's a holiday trip, when I asked about that they just said that it must have been the previous guest (so how much do they check the rooms between guests?) But it was a lie since it happened again the next day. The worst part is that the bed has a SHARP broken spring that almost cut my leg, fortunately it was just a scratch. Would never come back",1,1
"The great thing about The New Yorker is the location. Right in midtown, you can easily reach most of Manhattan's ""must see"" spots, as well as being conveniently placed for shopping. The hotel also has the fantastic Tick Tock 24 hour diner which is great for breakfast.   Unfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends.   The second we stepped out of the lift and saw the dull brown depressing corridors, we nearly turned back.  Our room was tiny. A corner room with two queen beds, there was literally no space to move around the room, let alone store a suitcase! The decor was old and tired, the TV didn't work at all and the bathroom looked like something from an old movie.   Under no circumstances would I ever return to this hotel again. There are so many choices in Manhattan - do",2,1

"I had one of my worst hotel experiences at the New Yorker Wyndham Hotel. The only positive aspect of that hotel is the very nice housekeeping staff. The front desk has very poor customer service and does not seem to care for the guests needs or requests at all.  The rooms also vary considerably. There is a part of the hotel that has not been remodeled which has absolutely awful rooms. Although, there were two of us, we were given the smallest room in the hotel, just over 100 square feet.,with a tiny bathroom. Looking at the floor plan on the door, we could see that our room was 1/2 the size of all the other rooms on the floor and was the only one that size. When I asked the next day to change the room, I was told that if there was another room, it probably wouldn't be available",1,1
"I currently have medical needs. I had requested early check in but understand it’s not guaranteed, so no big deal that my room wasn’t ready when I checked in. They took my cell number ( which I double checked was the right number) to text me when I checked in. 5 hours later, no text. Go back to the front desk to ask about my room and they say my room is ready to check into. NEVER received a text, why bother to take my number and promise to do so.  I needed a refrigerator in my room for medical reasons. I called in the morning to confirm it was in the notes that it was for a medical reason. They confirmed. Checked again when I checked in later. They said yes no problem. Got to my room, no refrigerator. Called downstairs to ask, they said they’d send it right up. 40 mins later I",1,1

Dirty  Front desk service was really great but the rest of the staff was pretty rude. We had to get a package and that was very difficult due to poor customer service.   Cliffs notes: hotel is in a great location but dirty.",2,1
"Very disappointed. Paid $20(us) + resort fees per day for upgrade. Room had no coffee facilities, very dated room. Couldnt get TV working properly, had to get the TV replaced. Only good thing about this hotel is the location and the tick tock diner. Would never stay here again. As for the noise it was like the traffic was in our room. And we were on a higher floor.",1,1
"The receptionist at check in was incredibly rude, she wanted to swipe my credit card, but couldn’t explain properly why, so I’m still unsure why you’re holding around $200 on my credit card. The room and bed were incredibly small for two people and we’re small. The decor on 20th floor and in the room were tired, sound proofing was poor- the shower and alarm in the next room woke us up! Our room looked onto a derelict building. The door man arranged us a taxi to Newark. It was $90 and ten miles away!! Take the Air Train. Positives- Tick Tock diner and the Italian on ground floor we’re both good and not expensive. It’s one block from Macy’s.",2,1
"Overall the hotel is in a good location, very central to everything.  Most of the rooms are small and outdated.  The check in experience was one of the worst I've ever experienced.  After at least a 30 minute line I asked to pay for a room upgrade and went upstairs to find one of the smallest rooms I'd ever seen.  We went back downstairs, waited again for approx. 20 minutes and were given another room.  In both cases the front desk clerks could not do anything without talking with a manager, a process where they disappeared for 10-15 minutes each time.  Upon checkout I was given a different room upgrade rate from what I was quoted and after waiting in line again...the lady at the front desk just stared at me like I was an idiot and it was my fault.  I travel 100+ days a year and",2,1
"I stayed 7 nights. On arrival wifi was down for almost all nigh, the second day my room was not serviced although there was not a NON Disturb sign out of the door, and finallly the worst of all as the hotel is making refurbishment in the restaurant on the entrance, there was no place to sit and work  or relax inside the hotel. The only option was sitting outside where there was no security from the hotel and of course homeless people from the street were coming and disturbing! Also from none of the reooms there is aEmpire state view as it shows on the interent!",2,1
"Checked into the hotel yesterday. The staff were friendly and helpful. Really disappointed with the room. There is only one small window and because the carpet and furniture is dark the whole room looks dark and dingy. Room and double bed is very small. Furniture is very dated. Bathroom, although clean is very cramped. So although it’s in a good location I would not stay at this hotel again",2,1
"Terrible services!!! Terrible concierge!!! Dated room!! The fourth floor to the eighteenth floor are dorms and small schools, not a hotel! And we were put on the 19th floor! We reserved the room with king size bed but was given the twins instead without any explanation. The receptionist just said it would be more comfortable for you two. But I wanted one King size bed and she could not make the decision for me!! The concierge's manner was really bad. When we asked for the cheapest way to get to the airport, he offered the most expensive choice first, which is  to get there by taxi! We had to find the information on our own until we got to know that there s a shuttle to the airport. We bought the ticket from the concierge, who was not really pleased with our choice.

"I haven’t stayed in many hotels in New York so I don’t have much to compare this one to, so this review is completely objective.  The location is amazing, right in the middle of so many things and walking distance to many more.  The lobby is beautiful and is a very impressive welcome to the hotel.   The rooms, however are downright appalling. Cleanliness is not an issue, everything is spotlessly clean. Even the tiny size of the rooms is not a real issue. Although annoying that in some rooms you can only just about walk around the bed you can accept it because the hotel has such a great location.  The lack of amenities is very disappointing, no coffee machine although I hear they will provide one upon request?? No fridge. The toiletries provided are of shocking quality, I don’t",2,1
"I originally took my husband (then boyfriend) here for his 30th back in 2002 and had an amazing time. Although we have returned to New York since, it has been for work/to see family so we have not had to choose where to stay again until this year. For his wedding present, I surprised my husband with a skiing trip to Canada and then a weekend in NYC for St Patricks day. For nostalgic reasons and based on our trip years ago (see the 5* review I gave), I choose the New Yorker.  We arrived after a long connecting flight from Vancouver and were checked in fairly efficiently. We had hoped to upgrade on arrival as I remembered last time, it was easier (and cheaper!) at the hotel but thought we would check the room first. The room was tiny. Even by NYC standards. To this day, I suspect",2,1
"Terrible experience at this hotel. Everything is outdated here. The rooms are small, the customer service is terrible, was charged for a movie we did not watch, and they do not have enough carts to load your own luggage. Take your business elsewhere. You're better off at a Hyatt, Marriott, Hilton, etc.",1,1
"My room was disgusting -- filthy headboard, rusted towel racks in the bathroom, grime in the shower, and old/musty smell. I was really disappointed because the building is my style (art deco and vintage) and I do love the vintage fixtures, however my room was just so gross. The room had no amenities --  no fridge, no microwave, no coffee machine. The cups in the room are plastic. I felt like I was at a roadside motel in 1980.",1,1
"The staff at this hotel is insanely rude. We had a couple of questions and issues and everyone answered with an ""I dont know its NYC do it yourself"" attitude. If you are expecting customer service, do not stay here. Also, this hotel does not have reliable room service so get ready to venture out if youre hungry. AWFUL experience. Would not recommend to anyone.",1,1

Stayed for three nights. Room was very small and not very well insulated from outside noise. The bathroom was really grotty featuring mould on the grouting of the wall tiles in the bathroom.  Great location though - very central.,2,1
"This hotel has old units that they give to people that use 3rd parties to pay . It's like they purposely save the outdated , smaller rooms for  customers they feel shouldn't get a good deal on their rooms. The Tv's are even smaller. And when I asked to be in an updated room they said they did t have any available. However, my sister. Hdckrx I. After me and she was given an updated room, probably  because she agreed to take a timeshare tour. They begin harassing  you as soon as you enter into the lobby of the hotel.  And everytime you go anywhere near the front desk. I wouldn't stay hear again. The Wyndham 345 is much better.",2,1
"This 4 starts hotel can not deliver fork & knife to your room. “If you really want them you can get them from the restaurant at the lobby”, that’s exactly what they told me.

Besides that, the room is not equipped with a water kettle and you can not have a hot cup of water delivered to your room.",1,1
"Very bad experience in this hotel... When we made the reservation, we could not select a single room because of the crib so we reserved a double room, we asked for a nice room for our wedding travel and a crib on the reservation. When we arrived at 4 am after 12 hours trip we had a single room ?!! whithout crib on the 8th floor (818) (there are 40 floors...) we waited for almost 1 hour for the crib with a baby really tired.

When I went to get the lift it changed. This hotel is filthy dirty. Desperately needs updating and attention. The rooms are tiny. The door couldn’t open fully without touching the bed. The room accessories and furniture were awful. The shower was terrible. The tiles had been painted over again yet there were bits of the original tile showing. The silicon around the bath was black, the grout in the tiled floor was filthy. There was a plastic covering stuck on the bathroom window which was pealing off and very messy. The net curtain was grey with dust. My fiancé was getting into bed and a big ball of hair was",1,1
The hotel is well positioned and staff friendly but the rooms need a bit of an update - rust on fittings in our bath room. Also $50 resort fee per night is a joke and makes u feel the hotel is ripping you off,2,1
"The website, building and lobby gave deceptive appearances because when we arrived in our room, the room had an outdated look.  I do not mean outdated meaning the 1920's, I mean outdated as an Econo Lodge or some off-highway motel.  My children thought they were in for a treat as they were when we visitied TRYP last year but, we were treated to a non-remodeled room with bare walls, old cupboards, cheap countertops, old tiles in the bathroom which had paint marks from poorly painted walls.  I lost 30,000 points on this horrible experience.  Will NEVER visit the New Yorker again!",2,1
"The room was quieter than I expected. The room, bed and even the pillows were small. Bathroom wasn’t functional and very small- no counter space, pedestal sink =water goes everywhere when washing your face, no towel rack and no vent/window that opens. The room is worn and outdated. Hotel desperately needs to renovated. Lobby and elevators crowded all the time. It smells old and musty. Do not stay here. The EVEN Hotel NY Time Square South around the corner is way nicer for a similar price!",2,1
"I stayed with my family(totally 4 of us) in a non-smoking executive room last week. I booked this because the description said it can accomodate 4 but it turned out the beds are smaller than regular queen size and it was pretty bad to sleep on them for the four of us. On top of it, the bathrooms are the smallest ever i have stayed. It's suitable only for 2 people, it should be listed accordingly, pretty disappointing.",2,1
"My daughter and I came in for the night, the front desk  were accommodating, however the room was not I expected. This is an older hotel- desperate for renovations, sheets were stained and the manager apologized, It was late so we asked for extra sheets and made the bed ourselves.",2,1
"The beds were not comfortable at all. Hard as a rock and nothing fluffy or soft, not even the blankets! The photos portrayed online so. It depict the actual rooms. Maybe. Room has been remodeled but this should not be marketed if it’s not what you get.",2,1
We booked the biggest suite they had and thought there was a mistake when we walked in. It was an incredibly small room. Incredibly small bathroom- literally only 1 person could stand in there at once. The “doorman” outside helped us into an Uber once out of the many times we left the hotel to go somewhere. Overall disappointed with the service and the size.,2,1
We stayed for 3 nights. The hotel itself was good. Staff went above and beyond to assist us with any needs we had. Location is convenient. Our BIG complaint is the drilling happening all night from construction down the street. It’s currently 4 am. The drilling has been going on since 10PM! What a horrible horrible night.   We would come back here but only when construction has finished. If you are planning on staying anytime soon please beware that you will not get any sleep. Thankfully our flight home is tomorrow and we won’t have to listen to this again. Alternatively I suggest you bring ear plugs.,2,1
"Booked through travel agent. Will suggest they recommend somewhere else. Only recommendation for this hotel is the location, Room tatty, and too small for 3 adults. Nowhere to unpack luggage. No drinks supplied. Breakfast for a dollar offered every time we logged onto free wifi, but not honoured.",2,1
"This hotel should be classified as a motel. They try to sell you false hope in the entry, but when you get up to the floors for the rooms they are in bad shape, dusty, paint peeling off walls, showers in poor condition, floors with dirt build up. The rooms smell of dust. Retraining for the housekeepers needs to done.   Their customer service at their front desk also needs to be improved, trying to double bill me for items I had already paid for and when I tried to explain it, I was yelled at and treated like a child and was not given an apology when they saw they made a mistake.    If you call housekeeping and no one answers don’t call the front desk, it will take them forever to answer, but on top of that they can not connect you to housekeeping or assist, I was told to call",1,1
"The Newyorker may have seen better days in the past, today it is a tourist trap where tour groups arrive by the busload. Almost no business travelers and no frequent visitors. Reality is far from what you see on the website.   Two women at the rewards desk (just before check in) were making fun of a guest as soon as he left the counter, because he was overly polite and spoke spoke with an east asian accent.   Website says breakfast at TicToc diner included and then the fine print reveals that only on weekends, on weekdays you go up to the Sky lounge which is a dull, empty room with a few tables and chairs where the pastries, breads, fruits weren't refreshed throughout my week long stay.

Stayed here for 4 nights with my sister in law for her first visit to NYC. Disappointed is an understatement. We had been told the hotel had been upgraded but the hotel looked tired in most places.  Our room was tiny!!!  and on the side of the street where construction drilling continued throughout the night! 🙈 staff didn’t seem to care about this. The beds were comfortable once we eventually got to sleep!  John on concierge was really helpful but the other staff I didn’t find at all helpful.  The redeeming feature was the tick tock diner attached to the hotel who served great food and the staff were really attentive.  The hotel is centrally located within a short walking distance of times sq etc so a good spot in terms of location but the hotel is definitely in need of some,2,1
Was very disappoint paid for 4 star got a room not big enough to swing a cat I had been to new York before and was expecting nicer Acomadation the tick tick restraunt was over rated and service slow food was not great would have been happy if I paid for a two star breakfast was included it's not a choice it a quosant and pice of fruit witch you often don't get,2,1

I think it will be my last time here... Elevator doesn't work very well and 2 days ago we must use service elevator after 15 minutes waiting for... Really bad time at The New Yorker",1,1
"The location is great, next to Penn station so excellent access to transportation links. However, this was probably the only good thing about the hotel.  Check in was slow (staff on reception even ignoring the queue at times to allow others to jump the queue). Our room was clean but very tired and in desperate need of an upgrade.  The walls were very thin: we could hear the showering running, the toilet flushing and people using hairdryers at all hours.  In addition, we'd emailed the hotel two days prior to our arrival to make a request, they were unable to help us with the request (that's fine) but it took them 4 days to reply to us - not really acceptable. There are many better hotels in the surrounding area at a similar price and we won't be staying here again.",2,1
Small rooms . Old old old building with rooms not very modern at all. Only redeeming factor was that it was very close to Madison square garden which I was attending a concert also room was clean as well.,2,1
"I rarely right a review but sometimes I feel I have to. Right across the hotel on 8th St., every night from 9pm to 4am there's a jack hammer working!!   Add this to breakfast being ONLY ""a cup of coffee and a muffin"", and outdated bath you get the idea.",1,1
"Stayed here as part of our honeymoon. Staff on check in were not friendly and did not give us any information about the hotel. Stayed on the 25th floor. Room was extremely small and basic. Bed, tv and wardrobe. Would have liked water or kettle or even fridge. Bathroom was also very small, shower was poor and there was no fan. Room was very small and looked onto an office building. Had to que for lifts each day. Security in place in the building so felt very safe.  Maybe standard for New York but did find it disappointing and would not recommend for any honeymoon couples.",2,1
"I was ignored since Tuesday night about my missing nightgown This hotel forgot how to treat a CUSTOMER. I will ensure I never EVER spend a cent in this hotel and also at any Wyndham hotel chain ever again.

"This hotel may appear sharp when you enter, but the hallway sure make you understand that this is not an modern hotel. It’s very old, and need refurbishment. Especially the bathroom which is very small with no storage.    In advance for our visit I kindly asked for one of the new refurbished rooms, with I read here, was actually existing. The answer I got was that they couldn’t promise anything but would put down my request. At the check in I asked if we got one of the refurbished rooms. The person I spoke with said; oh yes you definitely got an upgrade. Well that wasn’t true, so why lie about it?   The location is good if you want to live in the concrete jungle of Manhattan! The elevator was not late despite many floors.",2,1
"The hotel is in a good position and close to Times Square. However, rooms are old, crumbling and small. Cleaning can definitely be improved, especially the toilet. Noises until late at night coming from the street and nearby rooms due to impolite guests. Quite friendly staff.",2,1
"When we arrived, we checked in with a pleasant staff, and she told us about the refundable deposit fee that they needed our credit card for. About $40 per night deposit, however you get it back at the time of check-in. Which was fine. We arrived to our room to find that even though we booked a queen we received a full size bed. The room was so small that there was maybe a foot between one side of the bed and the wall, and a foot between the chair of the tiny sized desk and the other side of the bed. There was a TV mounted on the wall at the foot of the bed that you had to duck under to walk around the bed. The bathroom was so tiny, if you sat on the toilet your legs blocked the door, and one shoulder touched the wall while the other touched the sink. There was no storage in",2,1
"Book in & Concierge staff were terrible. Offhand, unhelpful & rude. They should all apply for a job at Starbucks - would fit in well there. As we didn’t want to book in to an organised tour - they didn’t want to know us when we enquired about main New York attractions.Asked a guy at one end of the concierge desk for a map. He said he had run out of them & sent me to cue up with many other guests at the other end of the desk - he couldn’t be bothered moving 3 metres to get me the map. Don’t use this hotel.",1,1
"Only stay here if you work for Virgin Airlines or if location is a must.     The rooms are small and dated.  Only those with a view feel comfortable. If you have a standard room you will be disappointed as your view will be of the buildings brickwork. Some views are spectacular but others will allow you to see directly into New York apartments.  Not exactly what I want to be charged upto $300 per night for.   We arrived at 1730 (five and half hours after the prescribed checkout time) and two of the three rooms were not available.  This was all after our long flight with three elderly parents who needed to rest.  We received one complimentary breakfast each, as compensation for the delay to our rooms.  Our rooms were not ready as they had allowed incoming Virgin Airlines flight",2,1

Will not be returning also bell men are rude don't do anything to help wait and sit around to watch.",2,1
"When I arrived I reminded the reception that I was disabled, could hardly walk and also wanted to stay at the same floor as my colleagues.. But I got the room most far from elevator and far from my company. The lady in the reception just said ""I can't promise you anything"", (I did book and payed for it three months earlier). Anyhow, the room was small and dark. Two windows, one of them broken. None of them  could be opened. There was a small television. Bathroom was dirty, a big brown thing on the side very close to the toilet and same nice brown stains on the inside of the door. Just disgusting. The wifi seldom worked 100%. What I saw from my window was just a dirty house wall. The guys standing in front of the elevators were always very nice and so were the waiters serving",2,1
"Extremely small rooms with basic attire.  TV's are about 20"" and run the annoying system where you can't see what is on TV without flipping through the channels individually.  The shower temperature is inconsistent.  Bathroom size is so small you can barely sit on the toilet without hitting the door with your knee.  The front desk wasn't overly friendly and parking was $60 per day...add an additional $60 everytime you take it out and bring it back.  I wasn't overly impressed with this property.  The hotel location is nice but I would expect more for the price.",2,1
I have stayed at this hotel twice in the last 2 months the 1st time the room was new totally refreshed and was very nice albeit small the 2nd time this past week I received a very old room that is not been  Refreshed in at least 25 to 30 years. The bathroom was dirty there is very little storage in the bathroom. Carpets were frayed and over all was a very uncomfortable room. The pillows looked like marshmallows but felt like rocks. If you use the hotel demand a new room,2,1
"Placed in this hotel by my Company. Art Deco description just means dated and tired!  Tiny rooms, small bathrooms, poor shower pressure and packed Lobby with long queues at reception. Area is central to Macys and Penn station yet pretty grubby with plenty of homeless around. High police presence which says something about the area!  Rooms here seem fairly cheap and this is for a reason, not recommended.",2,1
"The Shining anyone? Seriously! The lobby and check in are beautiful. We are no strangers to Art Deco as Miami/South Beach and Beverly Hills are also great destinations with similar style hotels and rooms. The problem here is very old carpets/walls, dimly lit hallways, etc. then to get to the room. We reserved a larger space and received a 150ish square foot closet with an uncomfortable bed that viewed a wall. I called to inquire and offered to pay an upgrade fee for a better room and was told that the hotel was fully booked for that night. Pretty funny that I could check online and reserve a number of rooms there for the same evening. We were traveling on a prepaid voucher so I’m sure that’s why they didn’t want to upgrade. When I called Wyndham reservations FROM THE ROOM, they",2,1
"First, buyer beware of the fine print. There is a $30 ""facilities"" fee per night.  Doesn't matter if you plan to use any facilities. This is not optional. It is also not clearly disclosed when you book. Since this is not optional, it should be included in the price. Anything else is a gimmick to lure in consumers based on misinformation about prices. I expected better from Wyndham. Second, the rooms are tiny and were last renovated in the 1960s. The corridors are plain miserably and a bit scary. We needed a mini-fridge for medications (an additional $20 by the way) and now we have to jump over it to get in and out of bed. Not impressed. Third, there was the sound from the HVAC system that felt like I was sleeping under a landing plane.  Yeah, I get it, it is Times Square, the",2,1
"I stayed overnight for a quick business trip to New York.  Pros: -proximity to Penn Station (4-6 min. walk) -central, easy to get around   Cons: -expensive  -tiny room with low to medium grade furnishings -closet is too shallow to actually hang clothing where the lock box sticks out -noisy -tiny bathroom with no place to put your shaving kit; hot and cold knobs reversed on tub/shower  I expected more from a Wyndham but it was only a night",2,1
"We are a family of six people that stayed at the Wyndham in April for 4 nights. We booked our room 7 months in advance through Booking.com. Through our booking process we got the info that the hotel was to be paid upon arrival. I notified the hotel that we would arrive appr. 8pm. When we arrived we got a really rude employee who, at first, did´nt seem to find our booking and then claimed that the card had been declined. I told her that the booking confirmation had said ""pay upon arrival"" and that there should not be any problems with the card but she kept interfering when I was speaking in a very rude manner saying that whenever one books through the internet, one should always call before arrival to check if the card is ok. Well....I have travelled many countries and stayed at",2,1
went to NYC for Beauty con and when we got to this hotel we could not believe how we were treated! The man at the front desk refused us a room meanwhile we had it booked for MONTHS! He was prejudiced against us because my cousin asked to be close to an exit. It was the worst experience I have ever witnessed. We had all our bags and luggage and had to be out in the city streets with nowhere to go. It was horrifying and embarrassing. When booking.com called the hotel they said it was because of the exit thing as well. The man also spoke very broken English which didn’t help his unprofessionalism. I strongly advise you to find another hotel!!!! DISGUSTING!! I hope this happens to one of his relatives so he can see how it feels to be left in the street with your luggage for a hotel,1,1
"This was one of the few hotels i stayed in while in NYC. I was there for 8days, so wanted to try a different one every 2 or 3 days.  The location is good, right outside the Penn subway, a huge building , but it had its FLAWS. When i walk into a hotel, it just not need to be nice and clean and beautiful and awesome, its needs to have friendly and respectable STAFF. Entering the hotel with luggage, they are not helpful. Than they have this sad and unwelcome look on their face, like as if i am staying for free. While trying to reach for the elevators, there is this security (good we all need to be and feel secured), but they behave like the bouncers from a night club. They have no smile either, they ask ""WHICH FLOOR, YOUR ROOM KEYS PLEASE, ETC"". One feels intimidated. For a moment",1,1
"I was Charged an additional hidden daily ""facility fee"" that was also taxed.This was not disclosed at reservation, check in or at check out.I called to sort it out.Hotel Rep was very RUDE!! Bad Form!!",1,1
"I have just spent 4 nights in this hotel with my husband and two children. We have been to New York before and stayed in a different (and lovely) hotel (which actually was cheaper) but, despite some of the dubious reviews I read, we went with the New Yorker - we spend minimal time in our hotel room after all. I was so disappointed though.   We checked in and were charged a daily 'service fee' of $22 per night - it's purely a money making tool, for using services like the gym etc and making international phone calls. I mean, like I'm going to sit in my room making phone calls when I'm in New York City! At check in, they also kept our credit card details for a security deposit style holding payment. This was obviously in case we damaged the room, but once we got to our room door,",2,1
"Location:  Very good location. 10/15mins walk to Times Square, near many theatres, cinemas etc. Subway right at the hotel, so very easy access to all mail attractions in the city.  Hotel:  Note: i have not visited NY before but am a frequent traveler, so will review, based on experiences had around the world.  The hotel is very worn. Everything in it could need a renovation. The water temperature of the shower kept changing and more often than not there was a distinct smell of fried food in the room. Beds are to the soft side. The doors close very loudly and you can hear your neighbors speak clearly in your own room. It is in the very low end, when compared to other three star hotels i have stayed in.  They charge a extra  mandatory fee they call a facility fee. 29USD plus",2,1
"We arrived at this hotel from the UK at 3pm to stay for three nights as the first stop of our honeymoon. It also happened to be my birthday.   We queued for about twenty minutes to check in to then be told our room wouldn’t be ready until 4pm. As we were only staying for 3 nights we left our cases and went out for the rest of the afternoon. We returned just before 8pm with the intention of having a shower and head out for the evening. We were told our room was still not ready. The concierge said that the previous guests had left late but that house keeping were cleaning it as he spoke (‘not out problem, find us another room’ I thought but didn’t want to start the honeymoon off on a bad note) The concierge gave us a drinks token each and told us he’d get us from the bar when it",2,1
"We enjoy staying at Wyndhams typically and after years of staying other places in Times Square, this time I went for a place close to Penn station since we are in and out after 1 night. What a disappointment. For over $300 you would think the room would be big enough for you to keep your suitcase open. We found one spot where we could open it up but it was in the middle of the walkway so it had to be opened and closed each time you needed something. I know it’s NYC and rooms are small but I’ve never had one this small.   I don’t know how much you have to pay for the views the others talked about, ours did not get us a view (see picture).   Check in wasn’t friendly, the lady that checked us in at the members desk asked us no questions, gave us no information on the hotel or",2,1
"The hotel is convenient and comfortable. Nice lobby spacious modern rooms. Unfortunately something was wrong with housekeeping and I was not able to get a room until 8:30pm. Not so good when checkin is supposed to be at 4:00pm. Many other guests had the same issue as we waited in the lobby. The staff were sympathetic but never explained why. Too bad because the hotel itself is very nice and a decent value for the price. As a busy traveler, this inconvenience makes me unwilling to try this hotel again.",2,1
"Dingy and dirty. In serious need of remodel. Tiny rooms. Barely room to walk by the beds.  Tiny desk.  Tiny closet.  Bath hot water alternated randomly between scalding and freezing.   Bed very uncomfortablle-like sleeping directly on box springs.  All in all, perhaps the worst non-budget hotels I have stayed in.  And frankly not as nice as a few Motel 6 I have been in.  NY hotels as a rule are pretty disappointing unless you spring for a REALLY expensive one, but this one was notably worse than others.  When I checked out, I was asked ""how was your stay"".  My reply was ""very disappointing.""  Her reply, ""Oh, I am sorry."".  Then on to the next thing.  No question about what was wrong. No offer of compensation.  No surprise.",2,1
My check in was delayed 2 and a half hours because the hotel did not have enough rooms ready. This made me late for the event at MSG I was attending. The room was small but what you would expect in a NYC hotel. The view from the room was average. The only positive thing about my experience here was that it is in a great location.,1,1
"Things seemed OK, but I awoke with SEVERAL bedbug bites. I cannot begin to describe the nausea and disgust I felt when I realized I slept in an infested room, and that I was attacked by bedbugs. Never having had this experience before, I didn't quite realize why I was itching until after I checked out, or else I would have made a scene at the registration desk. I was TOTALLY grossed out, and may NEVER stay at a Wyndam hotel again because of this.",1,1
"This hotel is old and very tired. There is a lot of deferred maintenance, and the rooms are not particularly clean or comfortable. My bed was old and squeaky. The claim to fame is that Nikola Tesla died there. I will give them this, I stayed on the 40th floor and the view was great and the elevators fast. Convenient to have 24x7 dining on-site. If remodeled this property could command a much higher price and much better reviews. All the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful. If you like Art Deco, you might enjoy this time capsule.",2,1
"We stayed here for a weekend.  I was disappointed in the quality of the rooms, very old, and had an odor.  The shower changed from hot to cold every few seconds.  We got charged a facility fee for each person when we arrived which was not mentioned upon booking.  I had extra charges on my CC that I am still working to resolve.  Would not stay here again.",2,1
This hotel was so small and so uncomfortable I wS mad that I didn’t splurge and go to intercontinental. I will never be going back here,1,1
"We stayed here with our teenage sons for 4 nights and wish we didn’t. I wanted the old world New York charm, which The New Yorker definitely had however, the staff were not friendly or helpful at all. Upon check in at the members desk, the man didn’t look at us once and was kinda rude to us! Not a good start. I asked security about attractions and he swiftly sent me to the “come for a feee breakfast and no obligation to sign up” desk where it took me 20 mins to explain I didn’t want to do it and just wanted ideas where to go.  Not a great start to our holiday!",2,1
"The hotel lobby is lovely. That’s about as far as it goes. When we checked in the receptionist asked to see my card, I assumed just to confirm the card I booked with. No, she swiped it and whilst doing so told me they were taking a $100 deposit which I’d get back on checkout. If she explained this first I would have offered to pay this in cash considering I would now get an international card fee charge. When checking out they didn’t even mention the deposit. I asked and she told me it will go back onto my card. I asked for a receipt and she seemed confused as to why I would want a receipt and told me to call the bank if there was a problem with the money going back in 7-10 days. So they can take the money in a flash but it takes over a week to return it. I may not have even had",2,1
"Its old and dated , stayed there last week for 10 days. the facilities are poor. Looks Grand but its still in the 30s. Maybe thats where it wants to be.  The beds were comfortable and clean.  But watch your Credit card they swipe at the front desk. mine was charged twice I caught it on the second day and after some discussion with the desk staff it was  removed from my account. They don't take it it just stays pending but then that limits your card. No restaurant per say just an expensive dinner tagged on to the  front Lobby of the hotel . Fine if you want to spend $50 dollars plus tips for 2 for breakfast>>>>>> . No water or mini bar fridges in the room as you normally expect. I travel all over the world and this must be one of the most basic hotels I have stayed in a long",2,1
"Printer didnt work in office room,quoted nearly double for hop on hop off bus tour from concierge desk compared to doing a research. Wouldn't bother with so called American breakfast,we had to argue to get cereal and ended up with two cardboard boxes. Management seemed overwhelmed when i raised some of these issues. Hotel is handy to subway,many tourist attractions. But in the end you do get what you pay for.",2,1
"Hotel lobby feels like a hostel or train station. No ambience and always busy. Charged a facility fee for Wi-fi that wasn’t clear in online booking. Charged for storing bags after checkout. First time ever for me!  Corridor to room stank. Room narrow and lacking any charm and tiny bathroom with nowhere to put anything. Tick tick diner for breakfast, surly staff.  Good location for subway, Times Square and high line were the only good things.",2,1
"If you want a budget hotel in a great location, you could do worse... I think. You are right in the middle of everything. Rooms are sub par. Dated fixtures, furniture and bathrooms. Rooms are small, even by NYC standards. Better value hotels nearby.",2,1
"Close to all amenities [ bus pick up points, times square, shops ]. Rooms were a bit small & you can hear water running in rooms next door. After a long day at Niagara Falls the next morning we were woken up by a hammer drill outside our room. Maintance was going on right outside our room windows. We gave it 30mins but then had enough. Rang reception & they said they would do a room swap today [ but we still needed to leave today & a room would be ready later ]. When we returned [3pm ] NO room was ready & at this point my wife lost it. She made a scene at reception & they gave us one room to look at [so small you couldn't fit your suitcase [opened] around the bed. They then gave us a twin double bed room [beds small so we sleeped in separate beds] & we then had to pack up again",2,1
"We were given a late checkout of 2pm complimentary which was much appreciated except on the day we were leaving the house keepers and cleaners moved into our room and completely stripped our room whilst we were at breakfast. They argued that they thought we had checked out despite the fact 2 suitcases, our passports and my straigtners were still in the room. I had also left my £279 michael kors watch in the bathroom which was gone. The management did nothing, we were made to leave the room at 10.45am and I did not get my watch back. Anyone staying here just beware of your valuables, do not trust the house keepers and cleaners!",1,1
"This hotel is in a great location,  but, there was only one plug socket in the bathroom above the wash hand basin to charge your electronic items - not at all safe. I could hear someone singing in the bathroom next door to me & thought someone was knocking at my door, when in fact it was for the room next door.",2,1
"I know it's New York but really miserable front desk staff in this age are unacceptable. No attempt at conversation, a greeting or even eye contact. Upon arrival to getting to my room the only person who smiled was the security member before the elevators. Check out was no better sadly. The room was ok, large with a beautiful view of the Empire State Building. This is an old hotel so expect draughts from the windows, however everything in the room functioned correctly and the bed was comfortable. No tea and coffee maker in the room was another let down, so I went across the road to the French cafe, only to find this had closed down. McDonald's was next door and saved the day! Beware though this area has gone downhill, take care of your personal safety, there are many",2,1
The hotel's good location is the only thing going for this place. I requested for a room with a decent view and I was assured that I was given one; but when I entered my room it had the worst view. The front desk operates like a train station; the staff is least bit interested in talking to you; they sometimes even appear disgusted when you approach them. Flimsy plastic cups in the room! 1 accessible charging point in the entire room (however they added a time clock with charging on my last night). Who charges for keeping bags (30 mins) after checkout? Overall a very bad experience; completely avoidable.,1,1
Stayed here for 5 nights in  Feb I am at a loss to why my review is so far adrift from others on here that find the place great. Firstly the lobby is fine but that’s it once you get in the lift and enter the corridors oh my so depressing and needs some TLC I can’t remember  the number of the first room but it was awful really awful after travelling for over 20hrs I just wanted to go to sleep but off I went to reception to ask for a different room so was very happy to be told we were getting a newly refurbished one well it was better nice basin lol and tv (not bothered when in New York about TV) the workmanship in these rooms is awful therefore everything looks tatty I definitely would not recommend this hotel. Location was good but very very noisy wish I took some earplugs,2,1
"This only redeeming feature of this hotel is the location.   The hotel is truly awful, from the minute you step up to the doors the staff are uninterested and unhelpful,  the rooms unappealing and tired.   NEVER AGAIN!",1,1
I write this review as I have been woken up for the third night running by party-goers returning rowdily to their rooms at 3.30am.  This is a huge hotel with 40 floors and the single rooms are small and uninspiring. The beds have a very thin quilt and for two nights I used my coat as a blanket before housekeeping picked up my call and I requested a second quilt.  The taps in the bathroom are stiff and I cannot open the cold tap but as no one picks up my calls to the front desk I have had to make do.  The feel of this place is like a giant youth hostel or budget guest house. The low price for the central location is its only advantage. And here come some more yelling and giggling party goers at 4am.,2,1
The New Yorker hotel is set in a great  location and exhibits beautiful Art Deco architecture which reminds of us of New York’s past Again on entrance you see glimpses of the hotel’s art deco past looking rather tired in a very busy lobby . The hotel staff are very welcoming and friendly .   Step inside the lift your taken to your floor . Mine resembled a scene from the ‘shining’ soulless corridors again very tired and dull looking . My room with a view of a window into the room of another guest was not the greatest disappointment . The room was small lacking in some modern comforts such as master light switch by bed a very uncomfortable bed (and oddly the only hotel which doesn’t invest in a thick mattress protector ) - not enough space for my suitcase etc . The bath room - no,2,1

"We are just returning from having spent 3 days in this very dated hotel. On arriving we were 4th in the line at reception, it took 30 mins to get to the reception process and a further 10 mins to check in. A very slow and unprofessional process. We asked if we could have a nice room and we're told she would upgrade us. That was a pleasant surprise, until we got to the room. It was very small with a bath about 4ft long with a poorly functioning shower head fixed to the wall. The room was very dated, although I must admit the rather small double bed was comfortable. The wardrobe had a very bad smell so we didn't use it. On our second morning there was no hot water, so after contacting reception and waiting about 30mins my wife requested a kettle so we could at least heat some",1,1
"This was one of the worst hotels I've stayed at. Room walls paper thin, I could hear people next door talking and laughing ALL day and night. Doors closing all night echo loudly keeping me up. Tv on the wall is smallest flat screen I've seen Water in shower goes hot to cold, back and forth with no pressure Rooms are tiny and fixtures forty + years old Towel track mounted behind bath door so it opens only three quarters of the way Windows so poorly insulated i can feel cold air coming in and the street noises horns, alarms, police cars, trucks kept me up all night. Vents in room very dirty Can't believe this is a wyndham",1,1
"There is a hidden fee like resort fees that were not included in bookings through agoda. Many other 4star hotels like doubletree doesnt charge you for keeping the luggage for you, but this hotel does! And it was $2 per bag! I would gladly tip the person $5 for our bags instead of just paying $2 per bag. The staffs werent friendly either. The showerhead was bad thus shower experience wasnt good. And the tapwater in the tub, at first, pour brownish water for like 10-15mins. A really bad stay for a 4-star hotel. Price wasnt that cheap either.",2,1
I requested a refrigerator 3 times from the front desk on both days of my stay and it never came.,2,1
This Hotel is very expensive for the level of services that it disposes. Unkind staff by check in and check out. Rooms dit not dispose refrigitator. Comparison between service and price non reasonable.,2,1
The lobby is nice step into the lift and you are transported to another world. Room was very small still containing 1920 furnishings  Toilet blocked and flooded the bathroom. Moped up the mess with towels and reported it to the cleaning staff on the floor who delivered fresh towels but didnt remove the filthy ones. We were out for four hours and still maintenance or proper cleaning wasn't carried out!!! You can hear all the neighbouring rooms ...noise is an issue,1,1
"15th till 20th December 2017: It was my first ever time visiting New York with my 2 work colleagues for a break. Overall I found New York to be an amazing city to visit and most majority of people there so lovely and welcoming. However my experience at the hotel was the worst I have ever had especially for a 4 star hotel. I was totally disgusted. First of all the rooms were so small and did not get cleaned properly as we found a previous guests sock in the corner of the room. Also there is no kettle in the rooms which is pretty poor for a 4 star hotel. Room air conditioning thermostat was rubbish, the setting is either too hot or too old and cannot be adjusted to comfort your needs. Bathroom was also tiny and so cold as the windows did not close properly. Water in taps and",1,1
"Like most things in New York City, The New Yorker Hotel is very tired and in desperate need of an overhaul. Many of the rooms are absolutely tiny with signs of wear and tear everywhere and heating and a/c systems clearly decades old. The impressive art deco roots of this hotel are simply not enough to hide the fact that this hotel just isn’t very good at all.",2,1
"Just recently booked a room for myself & my wife at the New Yorker, the lobby looks great since our last stay, price for 2 day stay was ok and very close to Penn Station. The room on the 24th floor was small and I mean small about 140 sq. ft. carpet is worn, fixture in bathroom was broken, walls are paper thin, you can hear everything in the room next to you from talking to flushing the toilet to taking a shower. Clothes closet is too small. Don't open the dresser draw and then try to walk around, can't do it no room. Tried 3x to call the front desk and no one picked up the phone just kept ringing. T.V. stations are limited and some that you do get to watch the color is red. I could go on & on but the best I can do is a poor rating. Website pictures are far different then the",2,1

I could accept this had I not been treated so badly by the front desk manager call Del. I haven’t in a very long time, been treated with such a lack of dignity and respect, by someone in a management position who should know better. Honestly I’d say he’s not fit to sweep the floors of the building. Thanks for ruining my day.",1,1
"First, the positive. Convenient location and a friendly and accommodating  housekeeping staff that promptly responded to a couple of routine requests. Otherwise, not so good. The Queen bed sloped sharply on both sides towards the middle; the bathroom was in major need of retileing and the lines at lobby checkout and check-in were longer than the line outside ""Hello, Dolly."" (Okay, that's an exaggeration). Overall, not a good value.",2,1
"I am a Wyndham Rewards member and paid $50.00 for an early  check-in. She told me that she would give me an upgrade, but instead the room was tiny. I asked for another room and they gave me a slightly better room, but not up to my expectations. I am very disappointed because the last time I visited my room was great.",2,1
"I paid $650 for 1 night in a family suite and the room was smaller than a regular room. They had the heater at 79 degrees, did when you walked in the room felt muggy and moldy. I called to get my kids sofa bed made, it took over 2 hours for house keeping to come. I had to call and complain 2 times. I was so disappointed. We were excited to eat at the new banker restaurant with the new volt area just opened 3 weeks ago. However, the food was way over priced and nothing great we paid $725 for 2 adults and 2 children. At time of check out we were asked if we enjoyed the free breakfast that we were never told about. When I said ""no I paid $80 for soggy waffles and disgusting boxed eggs"" they didn't care. Unnecessary Lines for everything. I will never stay there again!",1,1
"I was without WI-FI service for a six-day trip, even though I spent almost three hours on the phone with Tech services.  The WI-FI at Starbuck's across the street worked fine.  This hotel is in need of serious HELP.  The Housekeeping staff was wonderful, but otherwise, I'd look elsewhere.",2,1
"Hotel is a great location however staff at reception pretty unhelpful and not interested if complaints. Rooms are very small and basic no facilities to make a drink, no fridge, decor tired. Biggest complaint was on running a bath filthy brown scummy water, which did not clear!! Reported to reception they were not interested! Toiletries ok but no shower gel. Hotel dies have some beautiful Art Deco features",2,1
"This summer I stayed at this hotel with a friend and our children. It was a fantastic combo package that include tickets to the Empire State Bldg and free breakfasts. We were on the 34th floor with a great view. Loved every minute of it. Two weeks ago I brought my husband and son back to enjoy the Christmas season in NYC. At check-in my husband was told that we were being given an ""upgraded"" room seeing as though we were returning guests....terrific. We were put on the 8th floor with a view of a brick wall in a small room with an extremely small bathroom. The bowl sink looked nice but the water drained slowly and the bowl was so shallow that it very quickly could have overflowed. The shower was awkwardly built so that you had to stand in the shower completely to be able to reach",2,1

The staff on reception are shoddily dressed , the carpets grubby , the rooms tiny ( and we were upgraded ) the beds small with cheap , thin bedding.

Very disappointed in the negligence of hygiene, in addition to the poor customer service. Please proceed with caution.",1,1

"Just checked out, room was a strange shape and so the furniture didn’t actually fit properly in the room making it a bit awkward. Bathroom was very small and while I know it’s going for an Art Deco vibe, the place really seems dated. We could hear a crying baby most of the first night we were staying there. Not a very friendly staff, people sort of look past you when they speak. Ate at the diner several times for convenience. Food was good, service is terrible! Can’t beat the convenience to Penn Station and MSG. I’d probably look around a bit more, especially since it’s not the cheapest place in the neighborhood.",2,1
"I stayed here a few night with my boyfriend! I can tell you it was noisy, in a way that you really don't want to. Yes we heard the couple next door.. it has a beautiful view the higher up you get, but with the amount of hotels in the city I would pick another hotel.",2,1
"I came for a conference at the Javits center and the hotel was located just 4 blocks away which was great. The ""standard room"" was clean but was very small and had old, outdated interior and fixtures, and was in a creepy back hallway,, not  all what I expected based on the website pictures. The mattress was quite uncomfortable. The security here was good. There is no coffee maker in the room. I called three times to have one sent to my room and it never made it. I finally went to the front desk and the check in staff had one sent up. If location is important, it will work. Overall, not worth the amount I paid for the hotel.",2,1
"My experience at the Wyndham New Yorker was fraught with disappointment. I understand that rooms are small and that is accurate. But Construction outside my room (on the 26th floor, I mean outside my window) for 8 hours was a bit much. Then my electrical outlets went out on one of the two walls and another inconvenience. Then the shower would go from scalding to cold within minutes and without touching the valves. I tried to change rooms, but they only offered two double beds in an updated room. My wife and I enjoy sleeping in the same bed, so that was not an option. This may not be everyone's experience, just mine and absolutely factual.",2,1
First stay booked a twin room but this had not been done had no option but accept it as no rooms available told about the extra charge which had been placed deviously unbeknown to us in the booking paperwork. A ploy now being used more and more by American hotels and you cannot have it removed. Second stay twin room. The foyer is wonderful and that is where it all ends. Upper floor corridors showing their age dingey. The rooms aren't the best and bathrooms are in dire need of refurbishment. The hotel was booked by our travel company we relied on them to provide an acceptable hotel. Their turnover of guests is high and it is always busy. In this environment management are not particularly bothered as they have plenty of bucks coming in. Basically a lot of one nighters. Basically,1,1
"This hotel has a great location and is right opposite Madison sq garden and penn station ...10 minute walk from Times square and lots of shopping close by . The staff at the New yorker are hit and miss - Rachel on reception desk [on the right] is a delight and its very security concious ....we have stayed here 3 times as we come each year but after our recent stay last month we wont be staying here again . After booking i emailed to request a room with 2 beds [no reply to the email] when we arrived after 12 hour journey we were given a room with 1 bed which was designed for 1 disabled person and had no bedside table , no view and was grubby with black peeling grout around the bath and dirty bathroom floor and a musty smell . When I immediately asked to be moved I was told there",1,1
"Ended up paying for two rooms instead of one due to staff confusion and their customer service keeps responding with the same cut-paste response every time.  Also, watch out for ""Double Queen Bed"" room description, that actually means ""Single Queen Bed"". Rooms are renovated but the hallways are old and smelly. Felt bad bringing my mom here. :(",1,1
"I stayed here for a night, room quality is so bad I slept 2-3 hours and went to work at 4:30 am and slep there",1,1
"We stayed for a weekend me and my two girlfriends for a fun girls trip. Booking with three of us we were given a room with one queen size bed and told there was nothing they could do to accommodate us. The older lady at the front desk wanted nothing to do with us and was very, very mean to us. Our room was not cleaned the entire time and room service does NOT answer. Also when we first arrived our rooms were not ready so feeling like we needed to refresh and change after our flight we got ready in the bathroom downstairs of the hotel. Another rude worker came in and said “girls you’re scaring away the guests from using the bathrooms” first of all what does that even mean?! How RUDE!! We are the guests!! Ugh. Not to mention the hotel hallways and room looks like something out of",2,1
"The hotel is very old and quite interesting. There are renovated rooms, but we stayed in an older room. The beds were super comfy. The view was of the Empire State Building.  The bathroom was tiny as was the closet, but at least there was an ironing board and iron. One floor length mirror was helpful for getting ready to go out.  The diner downstairs was open 24/7, but the food was mediocre.  The bar and restaurant off of the lobby wasn't ever too busy with super cheap drinks in our opinion.  There was work being done right next door to our room so it was quite noisy for several hours, but not too bothersome. If you must wait for your friends in the hotel lobby, it was always super busy without a spot to sit at all so we waiting outside as the weather was nice.",2,1
Room was small. Sink in small bathroom drained slow. Had to call security 5 times because of noise in room next door. Was charged 10.00 a day for a facility charge. Was not told of this. Ask what it was for a nobody knew. 300.00 a night was too much for this hotel.WILL not stay here again.,2,1
"This hotel needs an update and needs to add some amenities.  Our room was small, with nowhere to even charge a cell phone except on the floor or hanging over the toilet; they could at least invest in a charging cube placed in a convenient spot.  The bathroom  -- old fixtures, no room to store anything.  No coffee or tea maker in the room; and no coffee or tea available in the lobby -- except in the morning when the Tick Tock Diner located in the building staffs a counter in the hotel lobby -- and it's not complimentary.  Housekeeping was very good, but the lobby staff were less than helpful.  The lobby is attractive, the meeting room that our group used was okay but minimal, the hallways were shabby and depressing.  My overall rating would be -- if it were an available rating --",2,1
"I've probably stayed in 20 hotels in NYC.  This was a last minute find on Hotels Tonight.   I'll avoid it next time.   For first-time NYC visitors, it might be fine.   Our room was the smallest I've ever had in the city.  Service was so-so.   Lobby was always packed with bus loads.",2,1
"One would think that a hotel with such a name would positively represent the city, perhaps it does, the part that is over priced.  I don't mind a small room but mine is claustrophobic and I was alone. The bed had a distinct middle and it is as bare as any budget hotel. It can take 5 mins to get on and off the evelator. The tick tock diner has slow and rude service and provides unappetizing yet expensive breakfasts.  The bar is nice enough and certainly necessary after anytime spent in the facility. And speaking of such, it is under constant repair, and they even charge a ""facility fee of $29 a night, I guess that is for the nice towels? Good location but there are plenty of better choices in the area.",2,1
"Location is great and price is very convenient, but this is more like a 2 stars or maybe 3 stars at most. It is old, dirty and under renovation. Personnel is rude. At 6:30 pm they had not made my room.",1,1
"The two main things you should know is this is in an incredible location. It's right by Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Javits Center, and Macy's Herald Square. That's a huge draw for travelers. It's also a gorgeous hotel, especially in the art deco lobby. That said, there are huge problems with this hotel. Housekeeping was very subpar and they once left someone's food in my room. There were chunks of tile and ceramic missing from the shower/tub. I paid for a room with a view and got a room with a fantastic view...of the room across from it. I have stayed at plenty of hotels and am used to hearing noise in the rooms next to me, but this had the thinnest walls I've ever heard. I had a good experience here as a kid, but I will never stay here again. The front of house staff",2,1
"This is my first ever review. It was booked based on a recommendation and we were really disappointed with the service. Check in was at 4, we checked our bags at lunchtime and arrived back at 5 to it still not ready. It was suggested we wait in another family member's room and it would be ready at 6 and given a breakfast coupon. 6.20 and still no word so I called reception to be told they had to check with housekeeping and call me straight back. We had travelled from Ireland and waiting in my mothers room who at this stage was really tired and we wanted to get out of the way. I called again in 20 minutes to be told same thing. I got annnoyed at this stage and was assured it was the Manager I was speaking to and she would get back to me. At 7pm we left the room to go down to",1,1
"The location is close to Penn Station so it is possible to get there from other main line stations and the airport without any problem.  There is also a tube line that runs the length of Manhattan. Although the location is good, the hotel is in need of decoration and repair, the whole place looks tired.  The bedrooms are small and dated and all furnishing has seen better days. Checking in can take a while, there is always a huge line. On the brighter side the bed was comfortable and there was plenty of hot water and towels. The  gym was good and not crowded.",2,1
"Big old building. It should have lots of charm--not here.  Postage sized pillows.  Postage sized room.  No glasses in bath.  No shelf in bath to put your stuff on while getting ready.  Substandard bar--looks like a Denny's diner.  But this hotel costs $1,100 for two nights!   Lame.",2,1
"We arrived on a Friday evening at 2200hrs after a long train journey from Toronto. We were tired & hungry. The receptionist was not at all helpful & just 'went through the motions' - demanding our passport & credit card details, issuing our room key & pointing to a space saying 'Elevator that way!' The corridors & lifts were shabby & not very clean & our room was little more than a shoe box in size with a shower over the bath which was difficult to control! As we left, 2 days later, we were asked if we had enjoyed our stay. When we explained our problems we were told we should have asked for a different room. Why? We were tired & hungry & couldn't they have provided a better room anyway? Or do they magically provide better rooms on demand!",1,1
"This was our second visit to New York and we were very disappointed with this hotel, we arrived at the hotel to be advised that we would have to pay a resort fee of over 70 dollars for the three days, I asked what the money was for but was given no explanation, the receptionist just stated its compulsory. We were given a room on the 33rd floor it was tiny, it had no view and the décor certainly requires to be updated. The bathroom was stark and not very clean, rust on all the door hinges. Toilet roll holder on a wall about 6 feet from the toilet. I know we should have asked to be  moved but we didn't think we would be successful. The only thing in its favour is its central. Not my choice and I don't think that I would stay again, and I wouldn't recommend to my friends or family.",2,1
"I booked 2 rooms, a 2 bedroom double and a queen room. On check in we are advised the beds are not standard beds they are ""small doubles and small queens""  Advised we are being upgraded to a suite - given the dirtiest run down room I've ever seen. Paint peeling, 1 bed has a big dip in it because it's worn out, the other you can feel the springs. Bathroom tiny and no where to put any personal items. No coffee or tea making facilities, fridge groans and then in the middle of the room there is a table with 6 chairs. Walls paper thin. View is a brick wall. Has balcony but it doesn't look safe.  Will be requesting another room -  This hotel is in serious need of repair. I don't believe they should be able to sell the room we are in.",1,1
"No free Wifi In the room as we were   promised. We cheked in yesterday (Saturday 7th Oct) and were negativly suprised that there is NO free Wifi in the room we booked (or anywhere else in the hotel!) We where told by hotels.com, the room that we wished to book included free WifiI. I called hotels.com twice to be sure! Free Wifi was a priority when choosing hotel.  Its such a disapointment and not what we expected. we will for sure not pay $ 54,95 for 5 days, which is completely overprised.  The staff is nice but in this matter (not very understanding) they advised us to use the free Wifi at the nearest Starbucks. Well, we will for sure not be spending much time at the Belvedere Hotel the next 6 days we have booked.",1,1
I stayed in a Queen size room for tonight’s and have to say I was disappointed.  Walking in the hotel it is truly impressive and I really only stayed here because of it being a historical landmark and the pictures looked great.  The room was really nice in appearance but the sheets were super cheap almost like wrapping yourself in cardboard.  The price wasn’t cheap so I was surprised  how uncomfortable the bed and bedding were.  The room was clean but the plastic toilet set had really strange and deep scratches on it.  The sink fixtures were worn and looked like it wasn’t cleaned .  The positive about the room the shower was amazing and had some of the best water pressure Ever.  If your looking for a short stay and can get it at a cheap price it’s not a bad place.  Overall the,2,1
"With high expectations, we arrived to a 2 night stay at the new Yorker just to find out this hotel is far from being a place you would want to stay in new York. It’s noisy both from inside (constrictions where being made on the floor above us and we called operator, they promised a manager will call us and guess what, no one called) and outside (windows are very thin). The serve from the stuff was lame, slow and very cold and unappreciative and the decor of the hotel, the lobby, the halls and the room are from the 60’s or something. Rooms are with discussing rugs and flees are everywhere. We wouldn’t believe what we saw. It looked like nobody saw the ugliness that going on there. Stay away from this hotel",1,1
"Had a terrible stay. Clogged sink drains, poor sink tap design leading to water splashing all around the bathroom, extremely small bathrooms, and worst of all, water leaking out of the bath area on to the bathroom floor!! Had to use bath towels to absorb the water. Had to switch through 3 different rooms in a 3-night stay. Given the 4 star rating this hotel has, i think it deserves a 0 star review, given even 2 or 3 star hotels fare better in comparison. Would suggest going for other much better hotels in the area available at a similar price point",2,1
"This has the potential to be a really great hotel but our room was dingy, basic and in need of a revamp (and this was an upgrade on the initial room we were given). The food in the attached diner was unappetising and badly presented but very expensive. Would definitely choose a different hotel next time.",2,1
"Advertised as ""metro room"" with a queen bed.  The room was smaller than a cruise ship interior cabin, had no drawers and minuscule shelf space in the bathroom.  No place to put suitcases or other people. Staff was very helpful and location was great.  Being from Idaho I thought the prices were outrageous, but again the location was outstanding for a tourist.  The safe didn't work and took a day to get fixed, but they gave us 2 coupons for breakfast.",2,1
"Our room was supposed to be on the VIP floor(according to the check in agent). Our shower leaked all over. The floor for 2 days and the toilet was broken.  While someone came to fix it , it was 2 days after our check in. When I asked housekeeping to come clean the floor because I just had rotator cuff surgery and was afraid of falling, they cleaned the floor but refused to come back to clean the room.",1,1
"We spent 4 days there, for one of our best friend's big birthday celebration.  We waited long time to check into our room.  The rooms were SUPER SMALL!  The lobby was so crowded and very unfriendly UNSAFE.  One of the hotel guests broke my luggage, and I had to discuss with the hotel security to get them to hold her accountable for her careless behaviour.  Evidently, this hotel is indifferent to guests' safety or behaviours.  Only saving grace the doormen were always helpful, and two on-site restaurants were very good, and it is just across stress from the Union Station of Amtrak.",2,1
"Having stayed in this hotel in Mid town New York three times in the last  three weeks in three different rooms. This hotel charges $ 380 dollars per night including taxes on average depending on during the week or weekend. All three rooms are on average 16 feet square with a small bathroom.for this amount of money you would expect a mini bar fridge and tea / coffee making facilities ,well they do not offer. if you do stay here do not fall for the free gift after you check inn . this is for time share at The Windolm Club a time share company within the parent company,who will take you across New York to their new development and you spend at least two hours with a slick high powered selling team promoting their time share options worldwide.

"Stay here for one night for anniversary trip. About one week before the stay, I get in touch with the General Manager, Ann Peterson and Barry Rauch, Director of Operations to see if they can do anything such as an upgrade to a better view room. No reply from either of them. Even if the hotel is full or reject the request, they still should reply to the email.   When we get there, the lobby is very busy and we check-in to the hotel. The receptionist is OK not much going on. There is a special check-in for Wyndham Rewards but it seems that it is always close when I check-in and check-out. She just checks us in and gives us the key. The room is located at 27th floor. The room is very small like most reviewer mention and very old but it seems clean. The sit on the toilet bowl is",1,1
"Arrived around 19:30 local times after what felt like a week travelling. Queued to get out room key and then was greeted by the receptionist, really not the greeting I was expecting, very little greet at all just a simple 'welcome'. I proceeded to explain that it was my wife and I 10 year anniversary and we had chosen their hotel for our stay (no response) the receptionist proceeded to talk with her colleague. After getting our keys we were collared over to join club Wyndham - thanks for the offer but honestly I'd been travelling for hours on end, wasn't exactly the right time for that.  We booked through a travel agent online and it was made clear on the booking that it was our 10th plus I contacted the hotel before we arrived - on to that, so I tweet at the hotel, waits a day",1,1
"Have just arrived after a 12 hour journey for a 3 day stay which has been booked since March. Checked into room oh my god disgusting!! It's no bigger than a broom cupboard, bathroom grubby and grimey. Don't even want to walk on the carpet,no tea or coffee making facilities, only upon request and they do NOT have any fresh milk at all in the hotel only powdered was directed to go to drugstore. See duty manager may be able to change rooms tommorow for an extra charge but can't promise, admitted its definitely not 4 star but it's the location you are paying for!!  My sisters room believe it or not, if it's possible is an even smaller broom cupboard than mine!! The room next door flush their toilet and it sounds like it's in room, very noisy , am definitely looking for somewhere",1,1
"The hotel is in a good location. very close to the penn and bus station. Walk a few blocks up, and you will be on times sq. The employees do a great job. The only problem I had was the building, and my room. The AC blows out out moldy or a musty smell. It was not only my room. I noticed it was in the fitness room and the lobby. I was told, try to change the room, but that wouldn't have changed anything, if it was through out the building. The fact is... its a very old building. With a very old duct system that needs changing. Thank god I didn't use the AC, because maybe I would have arrived home sick. I will not be returning, regardless of the location........",2,1
"Ok, so it's in a good position for Macy's/Penn Station. And that's the positive. The hotel is tired beyond belief. Painted tiles in the bathrooms. Upkeep of the hotel leaves a lot to be desired...but I guess the staff are just polishing a turd!!! Tiny rooms, and I know the rooms in NYC are never that big. You can here the TV/music coming from the room next door. Drab corridors. No tea/coffee makers in the room. Seriously this hotel needs major investment. It's Art Deco style isn't for me and I think the last time it was painted was in the Art Deco period.",2,1
"Booked this hotel through Thomas Cook in Deal Kent. This trip to NYC was supposed to be a birthday present for my partners 65th birthday But ""That"" was a mistake to start with as the agent recommended this hotel to us but she had never stayed there, yes it's central to all attractions and right next to Penn Station and Maddison Square gardens but after you admire the outside of the building you expect great things, and to be honest the main foyer to the hotel is full of Art Deco beauty but that's where it finished. The front of house staff were rude and arrogant also we were not told we would be stung with a $220 compulsory bill before they would give us our keys, this was to cover cleaning the room, use of conference facilities, wifi and use of the gym. Why the hell do I want",1,1
"Of all of the hotels in NYC, I would stay somewhere else. The room we were in was very small. The ceiling in the hallway is maybe 7' tall, but seemed lower and, the hallway to our room was narrow with a lot of turns.    Valet was quick. The location is ok, depending on what you are in the area for and where you need to go. Walking to Times Square for example, is approximately a  20 minute walk.   The restaurant downstairs of the hotel is great and very busy, at least when I was there.",2,1
"This hotel knows that you will only visit once and therefore seeks every opportunity to extract additional cash: beware the ""facility fee"" charge slipped under your door sometime during the middle of the night...questioning this unexpected charge, you will be blandly told that it is all made quite clear in the ""paperwork"", don't expect them to mention it at check in though. Then there are the queues...queues to check in, queues to check out, store your bags (for a fee, of course), queues to collect your bags, speak to the polite but oh so indifferent staff, queues are the New Yorker way. However, room, facilities fine but, worth the hassle? Not sure...",2,1
"When we checked in we were given a room on the 34th floor, it was the smallest room I've ever seen, not even enough room to manoeuvre a suitcase across the room. The entire room is in desperate need of an update. We complained at the front desk and they gave us a new room on the 19th floor. This room was bigger but still had the same dated furniture. The bathroom was terrible, there was no room to put any toiletries and the shower was poor. Not worth the money",2,1
"Unfortunately I was not pleased with the quality of this hotel.  The lobby was filled with a cigarette smoke like scent and while I sat and waited for my room for hours I spoke with a very drunk woman and another (not drunk) woman who was "" killing time waiting for a bus to Philadelphia."" The check in process was overwhelming, with a long line that lead to three visibly stressed front desk agents. Check in time was 4pm and as an 11am arrival, they made sure that I checked in at 401pm. It felt like a line at the meat market that never ended.  Keep in mind that this property is right next to the train station so the transient traffic is unreal. When I finally got my room key I was told that I was upgraded to a double  room with a balcony. Well, the excitement vanished when I",2,1
Returning from Europe I needed Hotel close to Penn Station- this seemed to be ideal - I prepaid in full - however on check I had to pay an additional $23 for a faculties fee - mandatory whether you use or not!  The customer service was poor and I was placed in a room on the 22nd floor in a corner - not an ideal location for a single traveling alone!,2,1
"The location is good - not far from Times Square.  However we queued to check in and were then 'greeted' by a very abrupt receptionist. They were busy but still no need for such a 'lack of welcome' We went to our room - much of the hotel has been refurbished apparently - not our room, it was shabby and very small. The bathroom tiny - we stored toiletries on the floor!  On day 2 of a 3 night stay our Tv broke down , the coffee machine didn't work and our room key was blocked. We were eventually moved to a different room, which was apparently an executive room it was much better had been refurbished but not much bigger!  We have stayed in New York previously and don't expect large rooms but...  We wouldn't stay there again.",2,1
"The best part of this hotel is the location . Other than that, it's worse than a Motel 6. Not clean at all. If you're looking for comfort and nice amenities, this is NOT the hotel for you. However, if you want to be in walking distance if shopping, food and Times Square, you maybe willing to look over a less than comfortable hotel stay. Not my cup of tea, will never stay again.",1,1
"To begin, the location is pretty good because of the proximity to the Empire State Building and Penn Station (lots of subways go by this place). However, staying next to the busiest corner of the city makes it impossible to open the window at any time because of the noise and the lights. If you're looking for some quiet time when back home at night, you might like to find a place above the 59th St. or south (Soho, West Village, Tribeca, Brooklyn). I'm generally not very sensitive to noise of any kind, yet I haven't experienced something that much overwhelming so far. You have to know that 34th St. (where the hotel sits) is one of the busiest street in the whole city, day and night. Moreover, I don't think it would be appropriate to call it ""cleaning"" but hey, that's what it's",2,1
"super tiny rooms, no space for bags. and bathroom is so old. shower is terrible, there is no normal running water, its a spurt of hot and a spurt of cold.",2,1
The area is very busy and with that comes noise...inside the hotel the staff are varied...some dont speak even when addressed...others are ok. The lobby is nice but its like stepping into a wind tunnel with various doors open Hotel was built in 1929 the exterior is lovely the rooms need attention..walls are paper thin and you can hear conversations and bathroom usage from adjoining rooms  If you want to be in the thick of things this is the place for you,2,1
"Basically our travel agent sold us this hotel as one of the most exclusive hotels in NY. The lobby looks awesome but then you get into the reception desk and you find quite rude employes. We were lucky to beeing treating with Jessica, she told all everything was paid for and that a deposit of $45 per night will be kept for security reasons. We agreed as that is standart. We got into the room after beeing waiting for an elevator for 5 minutes and the room was small but we thought it was clean.  On our 3rd day here the hot water stoped working so we phoned to let reception know. I phoned 2 times and they said a person was coming to check what was going on. I am still waiting for that person to come.  We pointed out that the bath was dirty and we had breakfast vouchers and a",1,1
"Stopped here a few weeks ago. The 1st room we were given smelt really strong of cigarettes, was not clean and was very small and dingy (I'm not a big fattie by the way, nether is my other half). Asked for a change of room, which I was given but not much better. At least it didn't smell and was slightly larger. Still wasn't very clean, the sheets were grey through age and bobbley. Only 2 of the 5 lifts to the upper floors were working, so long wait for lifts. Also long wait to check in, about 20mins in a queue. Staff only interested if they can ""up sell"", as soon as they realise they are not going to get you to book a broadway show with them and earn some commission from you they or quite rude and don't want to help! I would never stay here again. I have travelled a lot and this",1,1
"This room is so small that my son and I can not walk past each other without bumping into one another.  We were on a cruise a month ago and it's hard to believe but that room was larger than this shoebox.  Unfortunately we have 2 more nights here.  The common areas are sweltering hot.  Especially the elevators.  Elevators are not easy to get and when you do get one you will be smushed up against 20 other sweaty bodies.  Also, whatever you pay for this room when you book, forget it, you will be hit with a facilities fee of up to $35 a night.  Which is an absolute ripoff as we haven't been able to access wifi at all which is supposedly one of the items covered under this fee.  Avoid this hotel.  It's a joke.",1,1
"There is no coffee in the room, elevators are limited, almost always full, and had to squeeze in Everytime I had to go down or up. Ice machine is not on every floor, and going up or down in elevator is a nightmare",2,1
"I was scratching myself almost from the beginning of our holiday In Wyndham Hotel. I thought that it maybe was a mosquito bite, But then at the last day when I was packing my things I found a lice crawling into my luggage. I told the hotel about my experience, cuz I now knew why I had been scrathing all my holiday staying there. They told me that They would Get someone to look at it and then e-mail me, But I haven't heard from Them! See the pics In the comments.",1,1
"Of cause it is understandable that hotels in capitals or cultural centers of the world are tremendously expensive and thus when we look for accommodation we try to fit price, location and quality in some reasonable margin. This is exactly what I did sometime back when I first time traveled to USA. I picked New Yorker first for its location - which is convenient but for active travellers, who can walk through NY city center in 6 hours as I did, the location wasn’t that drastically important after all. The price,  I remember, was average, buy when I arrived they took quite big deposit and almost the same amount at the cost of my 7 days stay. This didn’t help me in budgeting my stay for next week, thanks god I did have some funds additionally to not starve there to death. It was",2,1
"rooms looked much better in photos. In actually they are old, poorly lit and dirty.  We found hair in the bath tub, a clogged sink, a lumpy bed upon our arrival. The front desk service is a hit or miss. Housekeeping is lazy.  The bathrooms are old with chipping and stained bath tubs (i've never experienced this before). Shower pressure is great but the shower curtain can't handle it.  The hotel is miserly about lighting in the rooms and it's all white dim lighting at night.  They were also terrible about honoring a complimentary breakfast included with our stay add per our booking confirmation - even though we had it IN written. Considering it was a long stay, we therefore spent a lot on breakfasts out.  Lastly the hotel does not have any  plates and provide only plastic glasses",1,1
So gross. We stayed here 6-28-17 to 7-2-17. I got back to the room on Friday July 1st and before I got in bed I decided to flip my pillows and I found a bed bug!!! It was almost midnight and it took 40 minutes to get someone to come up to get our stuff and into a new room. Never staying here again.,1,1
"My partner and I stayed at the New Yorker for three nights in late June. The location of the hotel is very convenient for Penn Station and Midtown, and easy access to the rest of Manhattan as a result. The hotel building is an art deco wonder, and the hotel exterior and lobby are very evocative of that era. We had a great view of midtown from our room on the 27th floor. However, the room itself was in poor condition. On entering, the room reeked of stale cigarette smoke and as we pulled back the curtains there was a lot of dust. The room decor and bathroom fittings were very dated and the air conditioning was noisy.  As other reviewers have said, there was often a long wait for the elevators.  My main gripe with this hotel is the excessive 'resort' fees. $29 per night (plus",2,1
"Not for business people. The elevators are a nightmare, the rooms are old and not well insulated so there is a lot of noise from all around. There was a smell around I didn't like at all. I couldn't relax for a minute. The location is its only advantage.",2,1
"Rooms are the size  of a shoebox no safety box no mini bar. The bathtub and bathroom walls had hair stuck in them, I complained but still were left there after they did the room. Every employee except for the security people I dealt with were unfriendly. Walls are thin and you can hear your neighbors.  Also I must have called the operator on 5 different occasions,  and there was no answer.  I asked for directions at the  information desk and was treated pretty rudely. Checkout was unfriendly also. The hotel was not cheap  , I was expecting at least a 2 star place. Wyndham seriously needs to review  this property  and better train employees.",2,1
"While the employees were good to deal with the overall experince was not a good one.  Upon arrival of my room it seemed as if i was placed in the smallest room that was soaking up all the noise in the area.  Not to mention the rooms around me.  The bathroom was very small, no space to spin around in there. After sitting in the room for about 20 minutes with all the noise I went to the front desk and expressed my dissatisfaction.  The manager on duty was able to change the room to one that seemed to be recently upgraded, although you could see that it was just a minor face lift to the room I had before. The money paid for the room wasn't worth it at all not even half the amount would have been worth it.",2,1
"I won't recommend the New Yorker, mainly due to the horrible, no good, very bad attitude of the people working in the reception area, beside other stuff. Here's my list of grievances:  1- Noise levels: the noise from the street is not blocked by the windows. Horns, police, ambulances and fire engines can be heard at the 28th floor at the same level as if you were on the street. The windows are not sound proof at all. 2- The building is old. But there are charming old and just old. The rooms at the New Yorker are the second type. Awkward floor plans, subcompact bathrooms and a strange closet are the norm. If someone is using the bathroom in the room besides yours, you can hear the pipes making strange and ghastly sound on your room. 3- The people at the reception: this is the",2,1
"Stayed for three nights at the Wyndham New Yorker, 481 8th Ave., New York. Booked on Expedia. When we arrived at the hotel we each where charged a Facility Fee of $29.00 plus tax of $2.57 per day. I asked what this was for and mentioned I was not notified of this additional fee when booking. The staff informed me that it covered use of Internet, Gym, and any phone calls made. I explained we will not need use of the Internet, Gym, or phone calls in the room. However this didn't matter and the fee was mandatory. I checked on line to see if the fee was noted when I booked and they did not note fee anywhere.   Also, this hotel is not a 4 star hotel. The rooms are small, staff not very polite, food is served from a cheap diner style restaurant, and the whole hotel has a dark, brown,",1,1
"This hotel looks like it has not been painted, remodeled or updated since 1960 or earlier. Aside from the fact the rooms are tiny and expensive the rooms are so outdated in every way. The bathrooms, furnishings, paint and everything else are so old and cramped. There are much nicer hotels for the same price in the same vicinity.  I do not recommend this hotel. I am surprised Wyndham puts its name on this property.",2,1
We booked our room online but they charged us extra 29$ per night. Our room was small and noisy. It was my first and last staying in that hotel . The location was good . Their price is not reasonable and I am not satisfied at all.,2,1
Having stayed in many hotels in NYC this was definitely not up to the scratch of the other ones!   Check in was quick and efficient. Staff were friendly on the desk and we got to our room via the old and creaky lifts! The room itself was tiny. I know this can normal in NYC but it was very very small. There was just enough room for a bed and a chest of drawers with a TV on the top. We did have a lovely view of the Empire State from our window but that was the only selling point.   The other disappointing factor was when we were checking out we got charged $2 per bag to leave them at the hotel in their secure room! In all the hotels we have stayed at we have never had to pay to leave luggage. As we had not been notified of this charge we only had $20 bills with us and the staff,2,1
After you've paid online the hotel adds a resort fee surchage - $29 a night extra.  You may see it in the fine print but this is an unethical and sneaky way to soak the customer.  I hope there is a class action on this business.  Definitely a very bsd deal for a place that is tattered and is most definitely NOT A RESORT.,2,1
Just back from New York and spent 4 nights at this hotel. As it was our first time visiting we wanted something quite central which it was. It's a 30 min walk to Central Park and not far from Times Square and Macy's. So the points definitely go for location. The not so positive aspects of the hotel is the rooms. Walking into the hotel reception you get a positive feeling as it's nice but upstairs it's very disappointing. We were on the 21st floor with a view of the Empire State Building which was good. The room itself was tiny and had a tiny bathroom you could not display anything. The wardrobe was small and there was hardly any room to move about in and it was really dated and looked like it needed a good clean. I would say it was probably a 2 or  pushing it a 3 star at most.,2,1
"We were extremely disappointed with the attitude of the receptionist on arrival at the New Yorker and, sadly, the experience didn't improve much after that. Our credit card was not so much requested as demanded and, when I queried the amount that would be held by the hotel, was simply told it was hotel policy in case I incurred extras while staying and anyway ""your company will be paying for it"". As it was, this was a personal holiday not charged to any company and apart from the internet charge of $10 there was nothing else to pay. A $49 charge was excessive, especially as it took more than a week to refund it. Once we got to the room there were no facilities for making a drink, simply the option to ask housekeeping to provide something but no explanation about whether that",2,1
"We picked this property because it is so close to Penn Station.  And that is a nice advantage.  But it doesn't offset the fact that this is a very outdated property with teeny tiny rooms.  Our room literally felt like a closet.  We could barely get around each other in the space around the bed.  We were only in town for one night and were so busy all day that we barely had time to be in the room except for sleeping, so it turned out to be fine.  But if we were there for even one additional day, we would not have been able to take it.  And even for one night, we'd never book here again.  We'd rather have a short cab ride and stay in a nice place going forward.",2,1
"If going to stay in this  hotel avoid room # 2201 it's exclusive entrance but it not make sleep all night due of too much noise, coming from the wall ,we complain to the management but no one cares. June 3-6-2017",1,1
"My stay at The New Yorker has been the worst stay at any hotel I have ever experienced. When you get to the hotel the Lobby is very busy and very nice. The buzz gives you a real feel of the city. The hotel is on a central location with easy transport connections. This is where the beauty of the hotel ends. Firstly, I was told the rate of the room was $159 plus tax, my total bill came too $260. When I tried to pay cash, I was told the hotel does not accept cash. Even though you are given that option when making a reservation. I was given a room on the 21st floor. When you come out of the elevator you are met with an old musky smell and a very dirty brown carpet. Nothing like the decor that you are presented with when you first enter the hotel. On getting to the room we were met",2,1
"Room very small.  Bathroom is so outdated and in dire need of a makeover.   All renovation was in the lobby to impress, but once you got to the room gosh beware.  Will never stay there again.  Hotel staff was friendly enough though.  Restaurant adjourning hotel makes it very convenient.",1,1
"The first star is for the Nespresso coffee.  The next is for proximity to times Square.  The bad things? Oh man, where do I start!  The room walls are flimsy. You can hear everything and everyone whispering in the corridor, or banging someone upstairs, or just laughing.  The bathrooms have no locks! You can't lock from inside.  Plus the bathrooms have no ventilation. So all the smells waft gently into the main room. The thermostat was built in 1930s and  has stayed that way since then.  Too hit, or too cold and zero air circulation.  No coffee machine jn room.  No water spouts on the corridor and they want us to drink tap water from a smelly bathroom.  Too small toilets.  The elevator creaks all the way up and down.  The room carpets are carried over from 30s. The only claim to",2,1
"First and foremost, I would never write a horrible review for a business unless I am utterly and beyond expressions dissatisfied. My husband and I decided to take a long over due day or two to ourselves to enjoy a stress free possible couple of days, as we have 3 small children, both work, and are both students. We decided to book this hotel based on its reviews that we thought were pretty decent. We check in Friday May 19th 2017, leave our things and decide to go nightlife exploring. Upon our return around 2:30am, after getting ready to get into bed I remove the decorative runner placed at the foot of the bed and find a horrendous looking striped brown colored stain on the sheet covering the comforter. I called the front desk to request new linens, the operator told me she",1,1
"My experience in the New Yorker has been deplorable. It is a dirty old fashioned hotel that does not deserve a single night on. The stairs used to accede the bedrooms smell horribly (attached photo of the condition of the stairs) and it is definitively not a friendly place. The security guards are quite impertinent and unwilling to help. I'll never recommend it to anyone, since it is definitely the opposite of what I expect in a hotel.",1,1
"Difficult to recommend this hotel, to be honest. Check in process is about the least efficient I've seen.  Anywhere. Ever.  I experienced a line 20-25 people long, with no particular urgency on the part of staff.   Rooms are tiny, but functional.  Noise is a problem, not from the city outside, but from the hallway.  Expect to hear every conversation that takes place outside your door.   The location is near Penn Station, but not much else, frankly.  So while the price may be right, you'll likely be happier elsewhere.",2,1
"Small room. We got dirty sheets. And I discovered bites, bedbugs.. Terrible service at check in, the person behind the desk aswered the telephone, and talked for 5 minitues while we just stood there waiting..  Will not stay here again.",2,1
The poor service from this hotel actually began a few weeks before. An email I sent asking for some Amtrak advice went unanswered - no big deal.  But on arrival things quickly went downhill. The first room we were allocated was a tiny corner room where both aspects managed to look onto brick walls. The WC was defective (flushed constantly) so we asked for another room. This was even smaller and again the only window looked directly against a brick wall. Staff finally agreed to a room on an upper floor (36th) which was acceptable but why was this not allocated first? Could it be that room allocations are prejudiced against those who book through travel companies?   However :- - the AC was noisy so we turned it off at night. During the first night we both woke up cold and there,1,1
"Was bitten by bed bugs on first night.  Having not experienced this before, didn't realize what it was until return trip home.  The room we received was very small and dirty with tissues and used bandages left on the floor from the previous guest; seems that there were 50+ years of dirt and cigarette smoke accumulated in the carpet and crevices, that no amount of vacuuming would eliminate.  Requested that Housekeeping clean room after first night and she stripped all bedding, explaining that room had not been properly cleaned or prepared following last guest's stay. We booked through a discount hotel site and upon check-in were told that a resort fee would be charged.  $145 for a 3 night stay to cover Wi-Fi, phone and fitness center access, in addition to our $695 prepaid cost",1,1
"Arrived in the evening and the room was not available. After more than 1 hour was not ready yet. Finally got the room, but it was a room for 1 person instead of 2. There was only one set of towels and although asked at the reception the additional towel, it was not delivered. We also had cold water and we had to change room again. It was the worst experience in a hotel i ever had.",1,1
"I reserved 2 nights recently *and prepaid* so that after arriving via red-eye in NY at 7am, I would get to hotel at 8am and sleep 3 hours before my noon meeting.  I called the day ahead to ensure there was a room for me when I arrived at 8.  When I arrived ... no room.  They said 30 minutes, but it was more like an hour, to get a single room clean enough for me to sleep.  They did eventually comp me the night, but only after I made a fuss -- the default was I just had no room when I got there.",1,1
"For the price you pay of almost $300 a night, you don't get much of a room. I originally booked a room with 2 double beds and it said it was 400 square feet. But when the Bon Jovi concert was postponed for a week, and it was Easter weekend,  they had no large rooms left so for almost the same price we got a room with only one bed and a foot of space on each side of the bed. They did not hide the fact that it was only 100 square feet. The bathroom is very small with a small sink that you cannot put anything on. There were 2 small tables with a small TV on the wall. No chair and no refrigerator. But if all you need is a bed and a shower you will be fine.  The people there were nice enough and security was good as you have to show your key to get on the elevators.  Just not worth",2,1
"This is the worst hotel in this price bracket I've stayed in.   We booked a suite with a view.  Initial impressions - the room was a good size but quite run down and with a tiny bathroom (the cupboard in the room was bigger).  Second impression - loud noise from building works in the rooms directly underneath us.  We spent over 2 hours trying to change rooms - not what's needed after an international flight.   Reception staff told us on different occasions that no building works were scheduled (despite the fact that we could see workmen on the terrace below, and could hear loud drilling, banging and clanging).  We were then told that the building works had been stopped - they had not.   Staff ignored our questions about whether the works would carry on through our stay.   We",1,1
"I booked via an online agency. When I checked in, I was told that in addition to the advertised room rate, I would be required to pay an additional non-optional $29 per night ""facility fee"", to cover usage of the in-room telephone, the business center and the fitness center, even though I did not wish to make use of these facilities. When I subsequently checked the booking details, I did notice the fee buried in the fine print, but it was not prominently displayed when I booked. I would advise other travellers to check carefully before booking whether the hotel is going to levy this fee. As a result of this experience, I won't be returning to this hotel.",2,1
"Most obscenely small room I've ever seen. Travelled to NYC numerous times, and people always say rooms are small, but this place is next level small. Feels like you're in a college dorm, but without the RA and the booze.",2,1
"Just returned from a 4 night stay. The hotel lobby was Art Deco & impressive but our room left a lot to be desired. We had a twin double bed on the 22nd floor. The room was tiny only just big enough for one double and not at all like the rooms pictured on their website, badly in need of renovation. There was also some outside work going on as there were ropes outside our window but we were out all day so it didn't bother us. Should really have complained & asked to be moved but I'm not one to cause a fuss.  It was easy to get around from there, one block from Penn Station and 10 minute walk to Times Square.",2,1
"The Good: Location, location, location. The Challenges: The newly remodeled rooms (which we were told were on floor 7 & 8) were (we were told)150 sq ft.,  but seemed smaller. The closet was about 8 inches deep so shirts, jackets, etc. couldn't even fit except at an angle that prevented the closet door from shutting. Imagine a bathroom where you can't shut the door unless you lean up against the small sink! The hotel is under construction so we heard jack hammers through one of the 3 nights we were there - they didn't work over night on the weekend - but bring earplugs!  We also had problems with billing. While we did have 6 rooms (family) when it came to charging appropriately at the hotel, we had to go through several different clerks, at different times. We also experienced an",2,1
We stay for a week Our room was increadible small .The queen bed  looks even smaller we asked to upgrade the front desk informed us that there are not king beds in the hotel .The hotel needs immediate refurbishment .Room service is via a pizza restaurant and tic toc restaurant next to the lobby ...The only good was the location .Overvalued 100%,2,1
"My husband booked a weekend getaway for a concert at MSG so he chose The New Yorker based on location.  We arrived at 6pm on a Friday night and waited at the desk for 45 min to check in only to be told that the room type he booked was not available....at 6pm??  OK, so they gave us another room with two double beds as we had no time to wait around for the original room.  The room was clean, but beware, those ""double"" beds are tiny!  I'm 5'5 and my feet were at the end of the bed.  We were determined not to let it ruin our evening, but come on.  For what you pay for a hotel in NYC, there were other options which we will choose next time.",2,1
"This hotel is really showing it's age. The check in lines are long and Mr. & Mrs Johnny didn't get the room type we reserved. Also the toilet leaked all over the floor whenever you flushed it. You could barely turn around in the bathroom. The coffee maker in the room didn't work properly. For what they charge, not worth it.",1,1
"Clean enough. But the room was freezing--we couldn't get the windows closed, the shower was difficult to adjust between boiling or freezing, the check-out line was long and slow, and only 2 elevators seemed to be working from all floors above 20.   The location isn't bad; especially if you are arriving in Penn Station. But I wouldn't stay here again.",2,1
Good location - across the road from Penn station.  If you are a first time NYC visitor it's close to a lot.  Room I stayed in was very small and very dated. Walls were dirty. Whilst many rooms in NYC are small - this room was particularly so.,2,1
"Bed room takes on a whole new meaning...tiny room.  Tiny bathroom...ok it is NYC, but it was the smallest room I have ever stayed at in the city.  That would have been ok, but the walls were so thin that I could hear the guy in the next room shave....at 4:30 am.  Never again...",2,1
"I booked a suite for the weekend and was told if available I would be able to get 2 bathrooms. The front desk host told me the room was two bathrooms and it was not. She had me come back down, wait 3 hours, only to check me into another room with 1 bathroom. She had no idea which rooms had 1 bathroom or 2.  This hotel is unorganized and delayed my trip by 3-4 hours. I would of had a much better experience had they of known what rooms had 2 bathrooms and which did not. Renting a suite as big as we did would of been nice to have 2 bathrooms. Also, the hotel needs major updates. The double suite had a bathroom so small you could not physically fit 2 small girls in there. However there was a walk in closet? Use of space is poor and needs major updates.

This in NY and so many places to stay just because she was having a bad day she took it out on us. Very unprofessional and very surprised she is in the hospitality service. Will say Calvin was very nice. Bad experiences always stick and are far more shared.",1,1
"Booked this hotel via Hotel.com as I was looking for a 4 star centrally located. This is NOT a 4 star hotel. We were very disappointed when we got there. The room and bathroom needed urgent updating. The carpets are tired and wore, the bathroom had mold and cracked tiles. We didn't feel comfortable or clean at all. The corridors are dark and feel dirty. And on top of the all of this there is a compulsory charge of $29.00/night for the use of the Gym, Business Centre and Wifi. Looking at the guests I would assume that most of the guests were tourists so why do we need to pay for a business center and gym if we don't use it?? This is probably the worst review I have ever written on TripAdvisor.",1,1
"On line it looked like they refurbished room.  Nope, 2120 is not at all refurbished.  The construction noise outside ALL night kept me awake. One of my biggest meetings in my career and I can barely function due to NO sleep. Our Company has 100s of people traveling and this property will be marked with do not stay. I asked from desk for a move to a refurbished room and I would pay more, ""sorry sold out""... Never again, DO NOT stay here. My great NYC view...",2,1

Rooms small, dated with sub par amenities.....and bathroom not adequately clean.  Poor check in service with a bad attitude.  Not to even a mediocre standard, just say no.",2,1
"My husband and I booked this hotel through Priceline as a last minute deal on a 4 star hotel. The hotel looked fine in the lobby. Trouble started when we were told there would be a $31 facilities fee for the wifi, the workout room, and business center. This wiped out any savings over comparable hotels. Seriously? We were checking in at 8, heading out to dinner, and leaving first thing in the morning. Could the fee be waived? ""No, everyone pays the fee."" Thanks for your consideration.  It got worse when they said there is not a king bed on property, only 1 queen bed.  This would be ok had it been a normal queen, as that's what we sleep in every night, but it was short, hard, sheets scratchy and narrower than usual. Not possible for ywo normal sized adults to sleep in.  The room",2,1
"Was supposed to stay five nights at this hotel, but after the first night found another hotel for the remaining four nights.  The rooms are dingy and small.  My room filled up with cigarette smoke which persisted most of the night.  In the morning there was no hot water in the shower no matter how long I ran it for.  Mercifully the water pressure was so poor I didn't get that wet anyway.  The location is good and the bed was small but comfortable.  If you are lucky with the location of your room, you get a good view of the Empire State Building.",1,1
"Stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel has a mandatory fee of 25 dolars per day to use wifi...ok... when I did the check out I asked to pay this amount in cash, I was helped by Samiha or Samira, cant really remember exactly. For my surprised I was also charged at my credit card with the same amount. Never coming back here",1,1
"All that is good about this hotel is that it is very convenient to most places: underground, Times Square, Empire State Building etc.  The only down side as other reviews have pointed out are the size of most of the rooms.  Our original room on arrival was so small you didn't even have a side table and I had to crawl over my hubby to get into bed.  The shower had been skewed out and was totally defunct and had been that way for a long time.  We asked if it could be fixed on the 1st day, 1st evening 2nd day, 2nd evening, getting the picture!  In the end on returning at 10:30pm one evening we went again to one of the 2 desks (no one tells you if it is the right one), just keep telling you they will deal with it, and one of the managers where there and moved us straight away.",2,1
"Ok, there are flowers in the lobby, but that, my friends is the closest this hellhole gets to being a four star hotel. We chose this hotel because it was very close to where we have to be in the morning. We got there at 5, they said our room wasn't ready yet but they had one on the executive floor, so we said great. The view is of a dumpster between two buildings, the key has already stopped working and we had to go get a new one, when I flushed the toilet, my husband starting laughing his head off... he said it sounded like an airplane was taking off behind his head. The beds are tiny doubles, and it sounds like the person above me is relentlessly pushing a very large office desk on a cement floor from one side of the room to the other just about every five minutes, just as I'm",1,1
"Don't be fooled by the fancy entrance to this hotel, it's cheap, but I wouldn't stay there again, the rooms are way too small and the beds sleep barely 2 people. The mattresses are like rocks and extra firm, the outlets are very inconvenienced and not very many to go around unless you like cramming your hand behind the mattress and headboard . The bathroom is so tiny, and I felt claustrophobic, the shower head was more like a fire hose or a power washer, the hot and cold water was bipolar. Not the worst hotel but I've had better. If you plan on having more than two people in the room, stay elsewhere.",1,1
"I tried to like this place, as I like to give all establishments I visit a fair chance. I usually do not comment on hospitality service, as I like to think of myself as someone who's not very demanding-- I'm usually and easily pleased, and I don't ask for much, if at all. I only note when I feel that there has been an indelible deficiency. Perhaps they're overworked or understaffed that particular night (11 January), but I felt that the staff at the front desk at the time that I checked in (around 9.30pm on a busy evening) did not provide me with a particularly warm welcome, as they seemed impatient. They were certainly not impolite (and neither was I), but I felt uncomfortably rushed for no reason, as if I was a nuisance instead of a guest.   My room was rather roomy and",2,1
"Room next to us kept slamming door and talking on a speaker-phone at an unreasonable volume,  Called front desk 3 times - told Security would resolve.  NO-SHOW and yet, I was charged $144.13 for a horrible experience.  Plus, we waited for 3 hours before getting our room.  Room 3028 was our room and the room of the rude woman was 3026.

"My wife and I travel often and have stayed at numerous Wyndam hotels.  We generally have had great experiences.  We stayed at the the New Yorker on a short trip to the city to the City to see a Broadway play and see a few sites.  Checked in at noon, but the room wasn't ready until 3.  Room was small and dated, but had a classic feel.  Slept fine, but there was a problem in the morning.  Sink didn't drain and you couldn't control the temperature of the shower.  Totally bumbed us out.  Had to take cold showers and had to brush our teeth with a full sink. When I booked the room on the Wyndam site, I was surprised to see a $34 ""activity fee"" added to the room.  I don't mind paying for a nice room, but this hotel is really old and substandard.   I reported the plumbing issues to the",1,1

Upon arrival we had a lengthy wait to be checked in and were then greeted by rude staff - not exactly what you expect at a supposed 4 star hotel. During check in, I had to hand over my credit card for a fee of $22 for our 4 night stay, when I asked what I was being charged for I was told this was a fee was to cover both of us for using WiFi and the phone. I've no idea why this hotel advertises that it has free wifi when it clearly doesn't - false advertisement must play a big role in how this hotel manages to get bookings.    Before we booked this trip we checked out photos of the room online and we thought they looked fine! Nothing extravagant or overly fancy but nice - we couldn't have",1,1
"Since some time they charge you a so called ""Ressort Fee"". For 29 $ you can use their Fitness-Room (i never do), you can make international calls (i use modern ways of communiction - so I never use) and you get access to their Wifi. What I don't understand is, why they do write everywhere, that they have free Wifi. So additional 29 $ if you stay a longer time you quickly have quite a lot money to pay for things you don't use or are supposed to be free. This is an absolute no go.   Although I really like the location of the hotel in the middle of Manhattan. Their rooms are clean but sometimes just a little small for what you pay. If there wouldn't be the Ressort fee, I would recomend this hotel to others. But with the Ressort fee, I don't",1,1
"Front desk staff are RUDE,  they just don't care. They have charged me for a service  that I did not have. Three members of staff who each told me that I would not be charged yet on check out I was charged and had to go through the exchange with a very rude member of staff who clearly lacked any customer service skills, to get the bill amended BUT guess what I was still charged on my cc card and now waiting for a refund which I know will not come. Then I have just discovered that they have taken an additional $80 for something I know nothing about this is THEFT!.  I upgraded my original room which was the size of a rabbit hutch to a room on the 37th which was the size of a very small garden shed!  so disappointing. The wardrobe was the smallest and worst design I have seen in",1,1

But when I checked in, I was told there will be ""facility charge"" for using the internet, phone, business center and fitness center. When I raised the question about the charges, the front desk woman responded with arrogance and rudeness. I declined the service and didn't use any of the facilities nor the wifi but was still charged for it at check out time. I heard the same complaint from other customer while I was checking in. Apparently, this hotel has mis-led other customers with the false promotion practice too. I have stayed in other Wyndham hotels before and hadn't been charged for this fee. If the hotel charge this fee then they should not advertise free WiFi. I will",2,1
"Very tired hotel: rooms are very dingy and in need of massive upgrade. When I was there last month, I was upgraded to a big room. However, even this above average room needed a refurb. Finally, my bathroom was infested with roaches - yuck!!  Finally, they sneakily charge a facility fee of $30 + tax on a daily basis and I only found out about this fee at the time of check-in. Not cool!",2,1
"We booked with the breakfast but this was a joke, only a bad quality filter caffe, one juice and a Croissant, if you want to have more you have to pay. In one morning a drog addicted come to our table to ask for food an nobody did nothing! Internet suppose to be for free but they charged us for this without to know. At home we discovered another 135 Dollars charge on the credit card, just like that, no idea for what. The room was very small with old furniture. In a windy night you can't really sleep, the windows are very old an making strong sounds. This Hotel is a 2 Star Hotel in Europe, for sure not a 4 Stars hotel. The Air conditionar  was very noisy, hard to sleep.",1,1
"I just checked into the New Yorker Wyndham that is supposedly a 4* hotel but looks like a 3* hotel and provides services of a 2* hotel. To use the wifi, the gym, and to be entitled to ""free"" international and domestic calls, the hotel imposes a MANDATORY resort fee of $29+tax. What?!?!?! Who needs free international and domestic calls these days??? This is upselling to the superlative degree! I am a frequent NYC visitor and stayed at many hotels in Manhattan and the Wyndham New Yorker is nowhere close to being a 4*. The carpets on the room floors are dingy, my room and the bathroom are so tiny, and definitely looks old. NEVER AGAIN especially with that resort fee. This hotel is nowhere near a resort! Rip off, beware!",1,1
"Me and my girlfriend stayed here for the weekend and it was just a bad experience. I really don't ask for much in a hotel, I'm very low maintenance and easy to please, so when I say this place sucked take my word for it. When checking in, we waited about 20 minutes for a receptionist. We were charged an extra $30.00 per day for hotel amenities  ( international calling/gym...which we didn't use once), and then given the wrong room. After calling we got moved to the right room, which was insanely small. The room was bare with nothing but a tiny t.v, the bathroom was even a disappointment. In the shower it took fifteen minutes of messing with the knobs to get it to a bare-able temperature, then fluctuated from freezing to scalding the entire duration. If I had to find something",1,1
"The hotel is well located in Manhattan  The best thing I liked was that I was provided with a Keurig machine and coffee when I asked for coffee. I was not impressed with the rest of the service. I called to ask for a shower cap and a shaving razor, but they never showed up. I called after waiting for 15 minutes, and they still didn't show up. After 1 hour, I gave up. There was hair in the plastic cups in the bathroom- see photo, and hair on the towel. Housekeeping should tie up their hair. The rooms are very small and not soundproof at all. I heard the full conversation of the lady on the phone next door.  There is no space in the bathroom to put a makeup bag or any toiletries, or to hang your clothes.",2,1
"The New Yorker is perfectly situated for those arriving or departing out of Penn Station as it is a short block away. It is also conveniently located to Times Square and other major sites. The hotel staff is professional, polite, and helpful. You can tell they do their utmost best to make an aging property like this one shine. Unfortunately, once you get past the lovely lobby, the hotel is a scary mess. Hallways are straight out of a horror movie. Rooms are tiny (though this is typical in NYC) and rather dingy and dark. Won't be booking here again.",2,1
"Very historic hotel in a great location.  Rooms are TINY, two of us can literally hold hands and touch the walls.  Bathroom is so far as to be non functional.  Our window was extremely drafty (and this was in the middle of a blizzard). The hotel didn't do anything at all to rectify this even though we asked twice.  Poor internet and they charge $90 for incidentals up front.  Bad management - stay away (but go check out the history).",2,1
"3 night stay for husband's 50th birthday.  Paid addt'l $200 for ""Romance Package"". Didn't receive anything that was promised until the next day. Hotel smells moldy. Staff less than helpful. Would not recommend.",1,1
"Let's just say this is a hotel for party animals. My boyfriend who had just travelled 18 hours from Kuwait and I stayed here dec 26th on the 24th floor which was a disaster. First of all, the room was tiny and dingy. Every corner you peeked in on the outside had a hidden room. We were kept awake all night by party animals especially a couple who was fighting next door. It was so bad where I had to call the front desk multiple times since I thought someone was dying. This noise went on for a few hours until the police finally came to escort the couple from the hotel. No sleep and even with such inconvenience, the only thing we were given was an extended check out at 4pm and 2 breakfast coupons valued at 9.99 each. We were promised by Michael Simms who's the member service manager",2,1
"I have to say that the Experience we had on this hotel was really bad, we expected a completely different service, the room was way too small, when we did the check in the lines were so long and they took so much time just to give us our room The location and the cleaness are the best things of the hotel. So if you are coming to the New Yorker, you better think it twice, because the relation between price of staying here and the true experience you will receive will never worth it",1,1
"Ok so... just horrible service all around. There wasn't one time it wasn't bad. They booked us twice and we spent hours transferring around departments to get refunded the superfluous charge. The night of, they gave away the room with a view we paid for, so we had a sucky room the first night with no apology but a $10 voucher to the diner (our view-room cost a bit more than that thank you). Every interaction with the staff, whether via phone or in person was shockingly rude, curt, and put off. I'm talking like basic hospitality common sense was totally absent. Oh yeah one time we were stuck in the lobby waiting for our bags. It was Christmas and the lobby was packed. There was no where to sit down and my mom was tired, so she sat in one of the two chairs in front of the ""Wyndham",1,1
"Understaffed, dirty room, worn and torn furniture, unfunctional internet service, rude staff, excuse given at almost every station ""it's the holiday and we are full"". Long lines at the front desk throughout our stay, room reserved not available. The bottom line is that Wyndham should remove their name from this property.",1,1
"This hotel is dirty, old and run down. The rooms are tiny even for New York standards and the Bathroom as horrible it was tiny with flaky paint!!! There was no safe in the room which made us worried about things being stolen as there ware always people coming and going out of the hotel.  When in the room the windows were single glazed so the room was noisy from outside traffic and the rooms seems to have little sound proofing also.   DO NOT STAY HERE !!",1,1
"The check in process was horrendous. It took 45 minutes standing in line. The service in both restaurants in the hotel was awful. The staff was rude at both restaurants...one waiter even began taking the menu out of my hand while I was still ordering. Everything was busy with it being close to Christmas, however that is not an excuse; there should have been more staff on hand (the hotel was not prepared at all). I have never in my life seen guestrooms as small as the ones in this hotel (photos online are incredibly misleading). It said they had been redone yet it was the oldest looking bathroom and room I have ever stayed in. The whole property just looked old. The water in shower was not easy to work and would not get cool causing my daughter to get burnt. The pillows on the",1,1
"Stayed here 5 nights on night number one me and my friend got sick after having a shower, the hotel provide drinking cups inside the bathroom assuming the water is drinkable no signs no nothing advising otherwise, no bottled water provided no mini fridge the water is thick brown dirty dirty water!! 4/5 nights of our holiday that we paid $1500 for to stay at this hotel we wer sick in bed absolutely disgusting after complaining to staff nothing was done they don't really care TBH! Rooms are small beds uncomfortable staff very rude not worth the money at all   Still awaiting the mangers response",1,1
"The lobby staff was terribly unorganized, not very patient with guests and at some times just rude. When management was questioned about why things were such a mess and disorganized blame was placed on others, no one would take responsibility for anything.",2,1
"We stayed at the Wyndham for one day do to the fact that we decided to go to NYC a day early and our other hotel had no availability. For starters they canceled our reservation out of error and when I called to correct the situation I happen to be online and noticed a lower rate. When I mentioned it to the front desk she simply told me she couldn't give me the rate online and if I wanted it to book it myself. No apology nothing. The hallway on our floor was extremely dark and smelled of urine. Our room was clean but extremely dark and out dated, not to mention the front desk told us the room had two queen beds and it actually had two full beds. I personally would not recommend this hotel.",2,1
"It is a cheap hotel, at least it was for us. We paid about $150 per night.let me start of with the check in, the line was nearly out the door. After you make that insanely long line good luck waiting for the elevator which can take up to 10-15 minutes. When you finally arrive to your room you'll notice a bathroom that is so old the paint is chipping of the tub and all over. The mattress feels 30 years old, hard and uncomfortable. And the pillows hard and small. Wifi might as well be non existent because it is so slow.   On the brighter side, the location is perfect. A block away from the train station and a few blocks away from Macy's. Housekeeping did a good job cleaning the room. They also have a great diner downstairs that has a delicious breakfast. If they would remodel the",2,1
"This was such a horrible experience . We came here for our baby moon. The pictures on the website showed images of a beautiful suite so I booked my suite for about 600 dollars a night. When we arrived the room looked nothing like the pictures. The room had a 1950s bathroom, was old, had no cable and did not have the amenities as deceptively depicted on their website.  I went to the front desk for assistance . They tried their best to place me in a better room however the rooms that were shown on the internet were unavailable . I was so dissapointed I called corporate for further assistance however they were absolutely useless I will never ever stay at a Wyndham hotel in my life. Poor business strategy overall on their part because they lose potential life long customers willing",1,1
"Pros: The location is great for visiting NYC.  Very convenient for train travel to/from Penn Station, and there's an A/C/E subway entrance just a few steps from the entrance.  Con 1: Be prepared to pay an extra $30/night (hidden in the fine print on this site as a ""resort fee"" and called a ""facility fee"" by the front desk) for WiFi and an exercise room, even if you have no need for them.  It's unethical for hotels to advertise a prepaid price and then require you to pay another 10% per night when you show up.  To the manager: Include ALL fees in the advertised price.  Con 2: The walls are very thin and the room wasn't in great shape (peeling paint, etc.)  I was woken up one night by a neighbor throwing up in his bathroom, the other night by young kids screaming for a half hour,",2,1
"We were extremely disappointed with the lack of sound proofing. Doors were opening and closing all night, people hanging out in the hallways and you could hear our neighbor when they would move the hangers in their closet. You could hear every toilet flush all around us. We heard every bit of ice that was dispensed in the ice maker in the hallway. We did call the front desk about the noise in the hallway and they sent security. But it was two nights of no sleep. We actually got accustomed to fire trucks and police sirens outside.",2,1
"Lobby is lovely.....guestrooms not so much. Our room rate $319 a night before taxes and fees bringing you closer to  $400. Tub was peeling, tile in bathroom cracked, chipped and years of gunk in the grout and edges of the floor. Beds were new and comfortable but the overall room was SUPER tired. You can see the potential here but they've got a lonnnnnng way to go.",2,1
"If you enjoy staying in a run down room that looks nothing like the rooms on their website. Ours was 9' x 12."" If you enjoy views of the side of another tall building...if you enjoy sleeping in a small bed (we were told we would have a queen size bed but I think we had a smaller bed). If you don't mind not having a mini fridge, a microwave oven or a coffeemaker in your room...if you don't mind putting up with a toilet that never flushes and having the maintenance guy come to our room every evening. If you don't mind all of these things, then the Wyndham New Yorker is the hotel for you.",1,1
"During check in, any info was shared about the hotel and its facilities from the frontdesk. And while I was checking out, the hotel charged 70 $ to me for the unused hotel facilities like international phone call and fast internet.I wanted to see the details because I am sure that I have never used phone or internet at the hotel; but there were no details attached because only being a hotel guest is enough for charging this amount for 2 days.It is not fair and the frontdesk is not professional about hosting. Furthermore I forgot my phone charger at the bathroom but they did not give it back or they did not replace it with the New one.They are not guestfriendly people unfortunately.",2,1
"Pros - great location, one block from Penn station. Cons - the hotel is very, very tired and in need of a major facelift. The rooms are tiny, even by NYC standards and the noise insulation is non-existent - you can hear conversations in neighbouring rooms and the plumbing is so noisy that if anyone on your floor uses a shower or flushes a toilet, it sounds like they are in your room! Bathrooms are very small and basic with paint peeling off the walls. I couldn't recommend this hotel to friends or family, it is budget in feel but prices aren't reflective of that.",2,1
Hotel is in a great location. I choose it for that reason. Close to LIRR to get in and it of Manhattan with ease. Not too impressed with the room we had (metro double). Washroom especially was in desperate need of updates. Very worn down and grungy. Awoken all three mornings by the room beside us when they showered. Turning the faucets on and off and having to adjust them non stop while showering emitted a high pitch squeal which I'm sure disturbed them when we showered as ours did the same. The tv in the room was ridiculously small and the daily hotel charge of $29 is outrangeous for what you're getting at this hotel which is nothing at all. I wouldn't go out of my way to suggest this hotel to others but if you're not going to be spending much time in the rooms than I'd,2,1
"I was booked this through priceline assured that it was a 4 star hotel quality. It was not. The hallways look like they hadn't been updated in 50 years. The room has been updated but some parts were still ""old"". The bathtub would be good example.  When I checked in I was assured that everything has already been paid for so I was surprised to find a bill under my door for a ""facility fee"" 29 + tax each night.  When I went to complain the manager told me he was sorry but the person that checked me in should not have said that. If you want a 2.5 star hotel in a good location then you should consider this hotel as long as you are OK with the ""surprise fees"".",2,1
"Thank you to the lovely receptionist that have me a corner room with a awesome view of the Empire State Building because it was my birthday....but that came with a cost.  Careful what you wish for.  Even on the 24th floor each night (2) sounded as if I were on the 3rd floor with the windows open.  Traffic, sirens, and surprisingly at 3:30 a.m.  ,...construction.  2 nights with little sleep.  Bathroom: awful.  Tub..clogged...bed...meh.  Sorry New Yorker but it's time for a serious makeover.",2,1
We stayed for 4 nights and was disappointed with the state of our bathroom. There was rusty bits on our tiles and the floor tiles were scuffed and chipped. The taps were covered in limescale and the room was very dated.  The staff at the lift area were extremely rude. When asking for our room cards to gain access they shouted YES and made me feel like a criminal.,2,1
"The location is fantastic and the building is historic, but I'd prefer a little less ""history"" in the plumbing. I suffered through a cold shower and brown water in my sink on one of the two days I stayed. The room is small, which I expect in midtown, so I wasn't too grumpy about that. The room could've used a few more power outlets though. This building certainly shows its age in every manner of speaking.",2,1
"Very disappointed.  4 Adults - we opted for an extra bathroom so help with getting ready - what a joke.  The one bathroom shower was horrible.  The pressure out of the shower head was so bad that I had to get on my hands and knees and rinse the conditioner out of my hair under the tub faucet.  Why the tub faucet had great pressure and the shower faucet did not, is unknown.  Also, room 2001 with the extra bathroom sits behind 2 elevators.   Needless to say - none of us got a very good nites sleep.I expected a hotel tax from NYC and NYS ($36.23) but did not expect a $29 facility Fee and then get taxed on that too. AND - $2.00 Occupancy Tax; NYS Hotel unit Fee -$1.50. Then you get the regular hotel and sales tax AND a Non-room tax by both NYC and NYS - really????? I thought I was",2,1
"The whole experience was totally underwhelming. My husband had convinced me that moving to the 'iconic' New Yorker for our last few nights would be a great move. Turns out that at least half the hotel is accommodating students and our floor was just above. We had noise of students banging on our floor (their ceiling), student mess clearly visible from the window in the floors underneath and students using the hotel facilities. The decor was outdated and the room was small. The management were polite but didn't go out of their way to do anything special. It was a far cry from the Empire Hotel which we had stayed at just before the New Yorker. The Empire Hotel in contrast was stylish with wonderful staff and an excellent location. The reasonable location of the New Yorker did not",2,1
"After booking our holiday we looked forward too after all we were going to New York,on arrival we were greeted by the reception who informed us that we had to give them our card details for them to hold $180 of our hard earned money.after we were booked in we were told about wifi in our rooms and a password was giving to us for the wifi in the lobby,not once were we told this was chargeable until the morning of our check out we got a nice surprise under our room door a bill of $98.50 for wifi.i think it's a disgrace that the hotel your staying in as a guest charges you for wifi,this was taking off the money that they were holding but that's another story.the money they take from you if you have anything else left that is after there facility fees and taxes we get the rest of our",1,1
"The staff was great: The room service, the bell hops, the doormen, the registration desk. First i was in room 2201. 3 closets, 2 bathrooms....very luxurious. But next to the elevator. By the 4th night (Friday) i felt i was in the middle of a train station all night with trains going on the tracks and reversing and once in a while just as I drifted off to sleep a big ground-shaking thump. So I called down and was told I'd be moved the next day, and I was relieved since my wife was coming in from out-of-state. Well, we ended up in Room 2238. Small, but that's okay. But the shower was four sprinkles with very little control over water temperature and the sink filled up with water the minute you ran the water (it was stopped up.) Two sub-standard rooms for a convention deal at $300",1,1
"The hotel looked good on line but is definitely not a 4star. This hotel needs some upgrading!. On entering the hotel the lobby was beautiful but as we entered the elevator I realized how tired the building was. The room was very small with no coffee maker, no fridge and the bathroom!!!!! The bathroom!!! The smallest toilet I have ever seen and the flooring was dark green and definitely needed replacing with dirt stuck in the corners and a broken towel rack. Because there was no fan in the bathroom the paint was peeling from the ceiling. To make matters worse I was handed a bill at the end of my three night stay for 38$ per night for taxes and amenities. What AMENITIES???? This is the last time I will be visiting any Wyndham.",2,1
"Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights, everything went wrong from the moment we walked through the door. We ordered a twin room, only to find out that we had one double bed. We complained and so the manager found us a twin room even though the receptionist said there wasn't any. We moved rooms at just after midnight, only to enter an icy cold room and damp bed linen. We just got in bed as we were exhausted from a 12 hour train journey. We woke up the next morning still freezing and the curtains were blowing as the windows were not properly sealed. We tried turning the heater up but nothing happened. We phone down and asked someone to come up and fix it but no one ever came. Would not recommend it to anyone.",2,1
"Well maintained Art Deco hotel. Queen room on 27th floor was larger and better laid out than many higher price red venues. Booked a week in advance for $285. Taxes pushed daily rate to $360/d.  Tick tick dinner off the lobby was pedestrian, would opt for Dunkin' Donuts or Starbucks for next breakfast.",1,1
My wife spent good money on a room with a view but we were stuck in the middle looking at a brick wall and another room. Ladies at front check in basically said nothing can be done. Very small room and old hotel. Location is very close to msg and Penn station.,2,1
"Hotel looked very nice from the reviews and photos, but the room was small and smelled of cleaning product.  Reserved a room above the 19th floor but was given one lower down.  Also they charged an additional ""resort / service fee"" of an additional $75/night!  Perhaps you can argue it away, but they should be ashamed of themselves for that practice.",2,1
"Went to New York celebrate my wife birthday, I choose to stay at this hotel. The first impression was ok.. busy lines waiting for checking and other line for check out. I arrived early, so my room wasn't available, we have to go out around to come back. When we come back we got the room in a high floor, it was very hard to find the room  on the floor it's very confused also the room was so small..I asked if I could change, front desk said they were full. The hotel in general it's an old building but some parts need to improvement as soon as possible.. I reported to the housekeeper  my sink in the bathroom was stuck and also when you using faucet  from the sink you get wet everywhere... so be careful! .. I called more than 5 times to requested shampoo and extra sets to take a",2,1
"Booked a Queen room and when we opened the door the bed was very small with barely enough room to walk around it.  I went to front desk and was told that beds in the hotel were a little small compared to what we have at home.  Upon looking a little further, the desk agent found out that they had put us in a room with full bed.  They moved us to a queen room in a part of the hotel that has not yet been remodeled. Bed was better but still a very small room. I tried to call for a roll away bed but could not get through to housekeeping or the front desk - both rang busy. I tried repeatedly.  Finally I went to front desk to ask for a roll away.  We went out to dinner and still no roll away. At 11:30 I got through to the front desk and was told that they were really busy with 50 roll",1,1
"Why does this hotel get good reviews? The Pros are obvious -- location. The Cons are too many to list. The lobby may be fancy, the hotel ""historic"", but it is a dump. The rooms are small, and I mean Japanese small. The rooms and halls are dark and dingy. The woodwork and doors are nearly 100 years old and have the paint chips to prove it. The bath fixtures are old and nasty. Paint was peeling in many places in the room. The TV was in such a strange position it was nearly impossible to watch. Maybe to the many many Euro visitors this is an acceptable hotel, but by American standards it is an overpriced flop house. If you are a Wyndham fan, choose the Wingate just a few blocks away.",2,1
"The hotel is dated, the rooms are extremely small, old carpet, one bedside table only, bathrooms too old, and worst of all it is extremely noisy. I know the location close to Madison Square Gardens and theatres is a busy one, but new Windows could certainly make a difference.  The Art Deco style of the Lobby etc is not enough to cover for all the deficiencies. A lot needs to be done Very nice personel at the reception",2,1
"When I visited the New Yorker by Wyndham I was expecting a very nice hotel, I was sorely disappointed. The room was small and cramped with the decor that haven't been updated for decades. The room service was delivery from the Resturant downstairs and the food was garbage. The parking was $60/ day valet & $40/day self parking... I understand that NYC is expensive but do you really have to rip people all the way off in broad daylight??  The employees were very helpful except for the doorman on the day before of my arrival, he was MIA and had to hunt him down to get my car parked. Next time I'll look a little harder for a better place to stay.",2,1
"Bites on back, chest, forehead.  Took off the pillowcase, the pillow looks like it is original from when the hotel went up before WWII.  Tired, small, room.  Stay away. The history is interesting, but this is well past it's prime.",1,1
"Booked through Expedia  and was given a crappy room. Check in reported that t we did not have a request for a view but not an option through Expedia. Checked in on time and on the 33 floor. Room was probably 12 x 12, and was in ok condition. Bathroom very outdated. No view of anything and looking at a brick wall. Asked to move and put in same room several floors down, Newly renovated but same shoebox. Staff very nice and suggested that we speak to them in the morning and they would try to accommodate us with a better view and larger room. Good location. Bed very uncomfortable with a dent in the middle. No king size beds at this hotel. I would NOT return to this hotel.",2,1
"Hotel is a great location, staff were very friendly and helpful  All went down hill when we entered our room- for what we paid never been in hotel with a room so small - glad it was only one night  Will not stay here when we return to New York in a weeks time",2,1

I stayed here last week. I got the email for upgrading my room for extra few bucks. THE EMAIL CLEARLY STATES that the upgraded room will be having Stunning NYC views of the Empire State Building or the Hudson River.    After i paid extra bucks for the upgrade..I got the room on 27th floor. But the room has no view of Empire state building nor of Hudson river..I could have stayed in the ordinary room without any view. The view I got from my room was just of an apartment building..In fact we got the room facing opposite to Empire state building..No way we can get the view of it from my room...Was very disappointing..Wasted my money on a upgrade which was no where an upgrade..My family was totally disappointed with the room. They didnt even had the drinking water in the room..nor a,2,1
"We paid  more than our usual for a three night visit and got the suite overlooking the Hudson.   They didn't tell us our two windows would be totally blocked with scaffolding,  broom, tarps, cement debris. My husband waited in line at the front desk to try and change our room.   They kept putting him off to come back later.   We came back after a tour the second day and everyone in the hotel was out on the side walk due to a elevator fire.   The security was very good.  You had to show your room key to get to the elevators.  The suite was nice, full dining room table, couch and chairs,  two tvs,  a wet bar.  But the bathroom was very tiny and cramped.  They never changed our room after all the waiting in line.  They finally gave us $20 off per night and took off the facility",2,1
The front desk people are very rude and unaccommodating.  I booked a queen size bed and they gave me a full size one instead.  The room was very tiny and the bathroom looked like it hasn't ever been updated.  Adjusting the water to a normal luke warm temperature was a 20 minute ordeal.  It did not work properly!!!! The only great thing about this hotel is it's location.  It's right next to Penn Station and Time Square.,2,1
"tired and shabby.  Staff on reception were pleasant and the cleaner was pleasant.  Thats about it.  Bathroom in big need of a refit.   The sort of hotel you don't want to walk around in bare feet. Half the things in the room don't work.  Lamp doesnt work, we can't turn the aircon down or off, the phone doesnt work - which is a shame as we are paying a supplement for international calls!",1,1
"Only for this hotel is in a great location it has nothing going for it!!! It had the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in!!!! I was so disappointed. When you walk in to the hotel the lobby is beautiful however that is not carried up to the rooms. To make things worse when we were checking out we were handed a bill despite our trip being paid in full in advance. The receptionist argued with me about it for 15 mins even though I gave him the booking voucher that I had received from our travel agent. I then spent 10 mins waiting to speak to a manager only to be told that they didn't have time to speak to me and that they'd 'clear' the bill. I was so cross! We stayed in 9 hotels during our trip and I never encountered rudeness like it, it really put a dampener on our trip.",2,1
"Very old,very rude staff..they must do a rennovation..old bathroom and very very small as the room! The staff was very unhelpfull, only 1 , 2 person was good..we needed to print some tickets and they didn't help us..they said that all printers are not working(????). Unfortunatelly new york was our last destination and this hotel was very dissappointed!!",1,1
"I know your building is about 100 years old, but do your rooms need to look like they have never been renovated all that time???  The pros:  Amazing location Historic building  The cons: Tiny rooms Rooms are extremely outdated Rooms are extremely worn out Employees at the front desk are not pleasant  Bathroom is extremely worn out, broke floor, tub looks rusty a little not comfortable for showering.",2,1

"Please be advised that this hotel is partially being used as a homeless shelter and therefore the halls an elevators can be shared with dangerous, loud people. In addition to that, the area around Penn Station is the worst in Manhattan as one will clearly see upon arrival. The check in area is a mix of tourists and homeless residents and their shady visitors. We rode the elevator up to our room with homeless people who were barefoot. Another commenter mentioned that it looked like welfare people were staying at the hotel and he/she is correct. A call to the local police station (or a good Google search) can help advise in choosing a better hotel.",1,1
"We are a family of four from Trivandrum,India but flew from Dubai to the US for holidays. We had the misfortune of staying in this shack for a night. Was the only negative part of an otherwise fun time in Manhattan. The whole place was shady, staff were rude illegals! There was a tiny 2 feet wide corridor to the room. No brerakfast. No wifi. They even charged extra $24 for facilities which we did not ask for. That was compulsory and that was the rules. Was never written before booking. Thankfully I won that dispute with a little help from my Bank.  People stay away from this hotel - you dont need to waste your time there or spend time to write a bad review in TA.",2,1
"The location of this hotel is great, close to many of the main attractions in Manhattan. First impressions when you enter the lobby are ""Wow"" as the decor is very retro but tastefully done. This is the only wow factor though! The hotel itself is quite old - you can see this from the poor standard of the bathrooms. The tiles look like they've been on the walls since the hotel was built. Grime has built up around the bath & taps and the room just smelt fusty.  Bed was comfy but bedroom was small, dark & pokey. Decor of bedroom questionable as work work has clearly been damaged and dinted over the years and had just been painted over. Very poor finish. Carpets looked dark & dirty and bedding smelt a bit fusty like it hadn't been aired enough.  What annoyed me most was lack of",2,1
"Well, it was our first time in NY, a business trip and we took out kids (infant and 7y.) Not used to this type of buildings... We booked a suite, to our surprise a very tight room, very small bathrooms not modern, more like public restrooms. A friend in another room saw a rat in his room. Not the best place... Small lobby. It has a nice burgers restaurant we went. The building has its history and a small museum. The place is noisy but I guess its the city... The thing we most liked was the view, the Empire State right in front!",2,1
"Book this hotel if you're looking for a good location in Manhattan, it's a close walk from Times Square and Broadway shows... And that's about it. If you book through Expedia be prepared to pay an extra $30 per person per night the moment you arrive as a 'facilities fee', which gives you access to the wifi, business center and gym. You have to pay it even if you're not gonna use any of these. The staff look disinterested and never seem to be wanting to help. I asked for very simple things like getting an extra set of bedsheets (they never arrived to the room), wanted to pick up a package that arrived in the mail (mail room was closed) and wanted a receipt for the $300 I paid for the facility fee (never happened). To finish it up, they charge you $2 per piece for looking after",2,1
"Worst NY Hotel stay ever. I was promised an early check in and a view. For this, I had to upgrade and pay an extra fee each night. Since we didn't get the early check in, and had tickets to a show at 2:45, we had to preregister where we were told that we would automatically get the room we wanted. When we returned at 7:00, there was no view and the room upgrade that we were supposed to get was either not done at all, or the worst ever. The top of the line executive rooms are so small that a dresser won't fit into the room and so there is none, I'm not sure that it wasn't a full instead of a queen sized bed and bathroom is VERY small with no water pressure. When I complained, I was told the manager would return my call and the upgrade fee would be returned. Not only was the fee",1,1
"felt very disappointed when going in to room,and sick when we saw the bathroom,must be like it was in the 1920's when it was built,shower head not working spitting water at you,toilet and bath very low to floor,bath made out of some sort of moulded plastic very odd,but sink clean beds clean.",2,1
"Upon arrival the hotel looks great from the outside, but initial appearances can be deceiving, as you get to the rooms they are tiny, old, outdated, and juts not up to 4-star standards, featuring cheap furniture and fittings, uncomfortable matress, dirty old carpets, and an old bathroom without a door lock! The quality of the room could have been overlooked if we payed the price that was initially given (I payed in advance) aside from the actual hotel price you have to pay for a $29 + tax hotel facility fee per night for services you might not even need and that were represented as included when booking! Very dishonest to force you to pay for something you don't need without any prior advice! We are very unhappy and disappointed, you would be better off paying a cheaper price",2,1
Very poor service. I reached hotel around 9:30 PM and got my room ready at 11:30 PM. I called them in advance and requested that I have 2 kids and please provide double beds in room but they gave only 1 queen size bed. When requested to provide pull over bed first they gave very small sofa which is even not good for 3 years kids. Had hard time to get extra bed to sleep full family. They charged $63 for 2 nights as service charge and don't have any facility. Only good thing with this hotel is location.,2,1
"Hotel is in a convenient location, next to subway.  However, rooms are extremely small and somewhat outdated.  Sink did not drain and called to have fixed but was not.  Also, no hot water from sink.  My room also was not cleaned for two days and was told that I had put a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door but did not.  I called and filed a complaint with the manager and was told that they had over 1,000 rooms to clean and were doing the best they could.  Lastly, there is no refrigerator in the room and elevators were out of order one day and had to use service elevators that were not air conditioned.   I will seek out another hotel to stay at during my next excursion to NYC.",2,1
Very poor rooms Not at all spacious and very congested.  The bathroom is also extremely small even though we booked a room for 4 people with 2 double beds. There is hardly any space to walk in the room. Not a good experience at all except that the hotel is located at a very prime location. There is no hospitality and even the receptionists didnt talk to us properly.,1,1
"This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel and now I know that it wasn't a one time issue.  We arrived in NYC early and tried to check in around 10:30- there was no line at that time but we were told we couldn't be checked in at that time and to come back.  Came back around 4:30 or so and waited 30 minutes, in line, to check in.  UNACCEPTABLE.  The same thing happened on my first stay as well. Got to the counter and was given a Half Hearted ""sorry"".  Then!  When we were checking out we need to check our bags because our train was leaving later...I was told that it would be $4 when we check them and then an additional $4 when we picked them up.  I have stayed in many hotels in Manhattan (our daughter attends college there) and have never, including my first stay with the",2,1
I booked another hotel but this one was cheaper or So I thought!!! Turns out my bill included a facility fee and when I questioned the desk attendant she was rude and said this is non negotiable. I said ok but the facility fee says we used the gym and phone etc and we didn't she said its a fee everyone pays. Needless to say I wont be staying again,2,1
"Very small ""metro"" room for the price. Bathroom needs to be updated!!!! Since the hotel was on 34st it was very noisy the ENTIRE night.",1,1
"My thoughts -  Pros - cheap, decent size room, friendly staff, very close to Penn Station which is why we booked it.  Cons - very tired decor. Rooms looked 1950's! In desperate need of a refurb. Lobby was ok but that was it. Cafe/restaurant that is linked to the hotel was very downmarket. I went in for an early morning coffee and there was a homeless person sleeping at one of the tables.   I wouldn't choose to stay here for a longer stay as the position is too busy and touristy. There are much nicer areas to base yourself at if you are visiting the city.",2,1
I arrived at the hotel after 5 hours of flying and all I wanted to do was to receive a nice welcome. But what I got was a non-impressive space to stay the night. The bathroom was quite small and the door didn't close well. The room as well was really small and for four people staying in one room it was a nightmare. The food from the restaurant was good though and some people at the hotel speak Spanish which was good because I'm Mexican and my family doesn't know a lot of English so that helped a lot. But still they can achieve greater things to live up to the expectations that they themselves set.,2,1
"Very Disappointed! Was supposed to be a queen size bed room- lucky if it was a double; was supposed to include wi-go then added to cost; towel were tiny; toilet paper was on floor- no holder- tiny room, bare minimum amenities in room as well.  We will not return. We did call downstairs to question them wondering whether we were in the right room - and they said yes . Never again. Terry Moskowitz",1,1
"This hotel is run down, dirty and no better than a 2 star even by NYC standards.   Upon checkin the hotel stated there is a $29.99 plus Tax ($2.57) per day per room fee for wifi, health club and phone calls.  I do not use any of these services and it was not disclosed via Priceline and their fees.  This seems to be the new scam in NYC hotel circles.    I have used priceline for 15 years and have spent well over $50,000  on their site in in this time.  After 75 minutes on the phone they were unable to resolve the issue.  I was willing to purchase more expensive rooms via express deals  and provide priceline with the confirmation number and they were unable to help.  Looks like I will never use Priceline again.",2,1
"Stayed at the New Yorker Hotel for 3 days. Checking in lasted 20 min. Than we had to leave the luggage at the luggage room of the hotel...another queue of 15min.. In total it costed is 35min just to check in... See foto of queue...  Staff are working under pressure. Service without a smile. Didn't feel welcome at all. Rooms are mediocre.   Location is brilliant. Despite this, will never come back and definitely will not recommend this hotel to anyone.",1,1
"Just returned from three weeks touring USA. Stayed in five hotels in all. This was the worst one we stayed in we hated it. It's huge which means big queues for everything. Check in queue took 25 minutes just to reach the desk which was a nightmare when you've been travelling and you have little ones. Checkout I had to queue again for 15 minutes as I needed to speak to someone about the facility fee charged, 31 dollars for one night stay. They said it included phone calls in your room, use of business centre, wifi access and fitness facility. Nowhere else I stayed made charges like this they gave these facilities except phone calls in your room for free! When I tried to use the business centre and phone calls in room neither worked. They did waive the fee for me in the end when I",1,1
"I purchased 4 rooms for two nights at the Wyndham New Yorker, 481 8th Ave., New York on Priceline.  When we arrived at the hotel we each where charged a Facility Fee of $29.00 plus tax of $2.57 per day.  I inquired what this was for and explained I was not notified of this additional fee when booking.  The desk clerk informed me that it covered use of Internet, Gym, and any phone calls made in the rooms.  I explained we will not need use of the Internet, Gym, or phone calls in the room.  Didn’t matter fee was mandatory. I checked on line to see if the fee was noted when I booked just in case I missed it and they did not note fee in Express Deals.    But, if I booked it under the list view they did note the fee and charged you for it.   Because I booked it under express deals I",1,1
"The location of the hotel was great- right next to Penn station and a few blocks away from Times Square. The lobby was beatitude and the staff was very friendly. However, once I got up the the floor where my room was, I was quite disappointed. The hotel was a dark brown color palette and it seemed sort of dirty. The room was very tiny and my view was of the side of the building. That would be fine except for the noise was unbearable. I was unable to sleep for both nights I was there. The location was great, but I don't think I will be staying there again.",2,1
I can deal with small rooms I can even deal with the noise but I cannot deal with BLACK MOLD in the bathroom.  I was so disappointed in this hotel.  The employees were great but the hotel itself.... sucked.  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.  Stay at the spend a little more and stay at the Marriott.,1,1
"Stayed one night earlier in the year, and boy was I glad I was there for only a night. Stayed at this hotel as I was stopping over from DC to catch a flight to Asia and thought it would be good to stay near Penn Station. Got a good rate for the room. Despite moderating my expectations, found the corridors Old and gloomy; rooms also dark and creepy. Hotel seems to enforce the 3pm check in time strictly - don't think the receptionist bothered to check if there were available rooms when I checked in at 1 pm after a 3.5 h train ride from DC. Extremely noisy rooms - sounds of water running through the pipes are incredibly loud, as are noise of doors closing, all starting from 6 am on the date of my departure.Not surprising given the number of guests staying in a hotel of this size.",2,1
"The only thing good about this hotel is the location.  It is near and within walking distance to many sites in town. This I the second time in two years I have stayed at this hotel.  From the exterior and lobby the hotel has a great old fashion look.  The room are very small. I estimate that they are about 1/3 the size of most hotel rooms I have stayed at.  The TV was not working correctly and several channels were fuzzy or unwatchable.  Ice was also hard to find. Ice was only on even numbered floors.  I could not detect any room service, but there are several cheap eat places near the hotel.",2,1
"We stayed for one week, they charged me with extra fees like parking when I never requested and I never had a car in NY, then I did a reservation with the $119.00 special they offer in internet, but the charged me more at the end because it was a weekend. I expected a better information before you get this hotel. Now, I must deal with back charges from my bank and deal with this problem.",1,1
"The hotel is well located on 8th Avenue, a short walk to Times Square. There is a restaurant and bar in the hotel and a 24 hour diner. The gym is sensational for a hotel and the staff are excellent. Rooms are very small, don't pay extra for a view as all you see is the building next door.",1,1
"Where do I start?  We had a ""renovated"" room.  If that was a ""renovated"" room then I would hate to see a non ""renovated"" room.  The bathrooms are very small - I'm talking 5x7.  I know this is NY but this was ridiculous.  Every other hotel that I have stayed in NY had larger bathrooms.  The A/C did not work properly the first night and we had to switch rooms on the second day.  (Our first night price was reduced by half price).  They also have an attendant by the elevator that you must show your room card every time upon entering the elevators.  I thought this was a very cheesy gesture.   I have never stayed at any hotel where you have to show your room key.   Last time I was in NY, I stayed at the Waldorf - Do you think you have to show your room card there??  Not hardly.  The",1,1
"I one time read a post from a hotel in Costa Rica I was considering. It stated that in Costa Rica 4 star hotels are different and can be considerably more rustic than 4 star hotels in other part of the world. I am now a few days removed from my stay at the Wyndham New Yorker and am still pondering if the Wyndham New Yorker considers itself on the same spectrum as Costa Rican hotels. Let me begin by stating that this hotel charges a $22 fee upon check in, in addition to what you pay to spend the night, for honestly no reason. They state it is for wifi and gym, etc, but frankly charging for wifi is very 2008 and not conducive to what modern hotels should provide its guest. The most appalling thing about this $22 ""hotel fee"" is that upon check out, if you would like to walk around",2,1

The front desk gentleman was Rude when I mention it. I will never stay here again. They were charging $149/single Metro room and they charged me $189 on top of NOT GIVING The FREE night. You decide if this is cheating or what?  Location is good..",1,1
"We had the misfortune to stay here for 3 nights over July 4 weekend. The room was a size of a closet, the mattress was rickety and gave us a back-ache. The sink would not drain, the furnishings & plumbing was a throwback to the fifties. No coffee-maker, no bottled-water, plastic cups, watered-down toiletries. The prices were outrageous and behavior of the staff was condescending, unfriendly and often in-correct information was passed out. No idea who rated this hotel so highly - we had a choice of several surrounding places but we relied on previous ratings. Wyndham needs to spend money to upgrade the physical facilities and hire better staff.",2,1
"The room we stayed in was tiny (not enough space to lay down a large suitcase), dingy and so outdated. I couldn't walk barefoot, disgusted how soiled with dirt the carpet was. And the bathroom...UGH! No proper exhaust and space to put your toiletries. Bed was lumpy and so uncomfortable. Small TV, no mini ref nor coffee maker. Don't get lured with the low promotional rates posted with third party agencies since there are additional hotel charges.The only redeeming factor is the location if you want to be in the garment district and Korea town. The metro (Penn station) is only a minute walk and about a block from Madison Square Garden and about 3 blocks to the Empire State. They offer valet parking but you have to allot wait time of about 15-20 minutes before you get your car.",2,1

This is by far the worst place I have ever stayed ! To think they have some how gotten a 4 star rating is incredulous ! This place is a DUMP ! And they have the nerve to try to scam the poor souls who have unwittingly booked a room at this hotel of horrors with extra charges !! Literally the bathrooms have holes in the walls where the rats must live ! In this disgusting flea bag hotel they supply no coffee maker or fridge but tell you at check in that they will gladly supply one if asked. They don't mention its at an additional expense. Stay away.

"Why is there a facility fee aka resort fee for what use to be called amenities? We were charged $31.57 for each night's stay at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel. We were informed the fee was for the fitness room, wifi, and unlimited use of the in room phone. Weren't these called amenities a few years ago? People use to book a room based on what the facility had to offer or not offer therefore each facility would try to offer services that possible guests would like. Now like the airlines, hotels are adding fees for services that were standard - i.e. an in room phone for an emergency or for an order of room service. I wonder why is this even part of the nightly rental? Why doesn't the hotel just increase the room per night rental rather than add this ""resort"" fee?  Wyndham New Yorker",2,1
"Chose this hotel due to location and price was reasonable. I stayed in an suite, room was clean and ok size for 4 people. Bathroom really needed an upgrade.  However, the front desk and management really let down my stay. We arrived from a very long flight to the front desk telling us our room had been cancelled and really that was it! Asked to speak to management and they said no its not cancelled but the payment was declined even thought I prepaid! After a very long discussion I gave them another card until I could call my bank and see what happened. Hotel offered us a better room but in fact it was the room I booked.

The rooms and bathrooms are so small (even by New York standards), the furniture so clumsy and outdated, it just doesn't make sense to me, and I have stayed in numerous NYC hotels of that ranking.  The location is very good (directly across from Penn Station) and I have no problem with the service or the people who work there.   Because I feared getting a postage-stamp room, I called a day before check-in and talked with an extremely pleasant manager, requesting a paid or complimentary upgrade to a larger room.

"I stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker Hotel one week 8-15 may 2016. We were 2 persons at holyday. I reserved it through Hotel.com to a fair price.   Unfortunately the price for internet at $ 27.50 per day came on top when I arrived to the hotel.  And it was not optional. It made me angry, and the price was no longer so fair. The location was good, in uptown part NY.  But the room was small and old, and with a dirty window - without a view. The hotel is built in 1930 an have a glory history, which describes in the basement, where there is a small exhibition.

"Had a forgettable one night stay earlier this week. I selected the hotel for its proximity to Penn Station and its price. The location is ideal. The hotel itself is dated - the lobby area is very nice but the halls were dreary and tired-looking. My room (a std. queen) was tiny and very basic. I did not try either restaurant and did not use the meeting/ event space.  Two reasons for my ""poor"" rating. First, the hotel tacks on a $29/night facility fee that is not in the advertised rate, supposedly to cover wifi, the business center and fitness center - amenities that are free in many places and should be free everywhere. Second, the only amenity that I actually wanted to use was the business center, to print airline boarding passes - unfortunately the internet was 'down' that",2,1
"I chose this hotel because it's very close to the Penn station and nice accessibility.  However, the front desk of this hotel disappointed me. Our stay was redemption with upgrade for an executive double room; she tried to charge additional for internet and amenities. I showed the confirmation then she said ""okay."" Moreover, we paid additional fees for the room but got only a regular double.  I asked her again ""it supposed to be an executive room located from the 19th floor and above, I believe?"" She replied ""no."" My mom was so tired and I just gave up.",1,1
"After reading glowing reviews for this supposedly 4-star art deco wonder, I stayed here for two nights. What a disappointment! The Wyndham New Yorker is simply awful. Dirty, old, musty, yellowed with age, inelegantly decorated, and not updated in decades.   I was given a room on the 20th floor, which on the face of it, altitude-wise, was great. But as I stepped off the elevator and traversed a couple hallways to my room, could not help noting the distress and filth along the marble base boards. My room was small, the bathroom tiny, and like the rest of floor, old, depressingly decorated (yellows and browns in my room). The door frames and moldings had so many layers of paint from cheap makeovers, they had acquired a distorted, misshapen, pimply aspect. The standalone porcelain",1,1
My mother who is Diamond member booked my husband and baby and I here for the weekend trying to do something nice. She confirmed multiple times including last night that we had the NY View Queen Suite. It even showed up online last night that was the room we were confirmed in. Unfortunately we got here and the reservation was changed to a double room. The management were rude and condescending kept telling me they were taking care of things. I am still waiting on Stephen the Concierge Manager to finish taking care of the things we were promised.   we did finally get the fridge it we were promised it only took numerous calls.  And after those calls They did replace the spoiled milk. Barry the operations manager told me he had no intention of trying at all to solve the issue.,1,1

We arrived at the hotel around 3:30 and there was an extremely long line to check in. A gentleman behind us mentioned that he had stayed here before and seen similar lines even at 9 p.m. so this was not unusual. When we finally arrived to the front, the woman at the desk was extremely rude. She rushed through everything she was telling me without looking at me once, so it was hard to understand her mutterings. I realized I agreed to the dreaded hotel fee everyone on TripAdvisor mentioned without the desk agent even mentioning that she was charging my card. She then, under her breath,",1,1
"Huge lobby that tends to be over crowded due to the immense amount of people that the hotel can host. We stayed in a double bedroom, on the 21st floor, very very small without fridge, cold due to bad windows that can't keep the wind out and as a result it becomes cold over night. As we got in to the room we noticed it is not properly cleaned, it is dusty and not hoovered. The airco works fine but is loud. The shower drips constantly which can be irritating over night when one wants to sleep. Plastic glasses and no bottle opener, no fridge too but there is no place for it as room is too small. Decoration is out dated and dark, maybe to prevent from seeing how dirty it can get. Housekeeping is not very efficient. Room had a safe, it's own ironing board and iron, which i could say",2,1
"This hotel has several pluses none of which are related to rooms:  • great location literally across from Penn station • historical exterior • impressive lobby  We got one of the old rooms which was in urgent need of refurbishment and in its current state can only be described as horrendous. It was small, noisy, dark and dirty with a décor straight from the 1970s. The bathroom was equally bad and tired with old uneven tiles painted over by green paint.  And the final insult was their ""resort fee"" which is basically a $27 mandatory charge per day for Internet access.  Avoid this dump, there are lots of better hotels in Manhattan.",2,1
"Rooms are really small. Two people can not walk by each other. The hotel is old and run down. Service is the worst I ever experienced! The hotel is run down.

At 3pm I came back they told me the do not disturb sign was on the door I told them it was not, either way, the room is not done and we have no toilet paper. he said we will send it right up and clean your room at 9 pm still nothing! No one would answer the front desk phone. I went down and talked to JB or GB he was rude and ignorant.

I'm all for retro style but these rooms and corridors are just grim! It saddens me to walk into such a tired dreary room. The windows are drafty too. The paint peeling off the bathroom which is tiny. Nowhere to rest the hairdryer except on the toilet seat. In this day I expect much better from an alleged four star in New York.,2,1
On Priceline this hotel was advertised as a four-star hotel.  I would rated this hotel between a two or three star.  Although I received a great price it was run down and did not meet my standards.  I personally would not stay here again.,2,1

"Great location and great deli restaurants in the lobby. However, the hotel is OLD, dirty (as in ragged carpet, scuffs on all the walls, etc) and loud. Once they give this place a face lift it will be fantastic - and expensive. There were a few floors on my side of the hotel that were school dorms - weird. I think some of those kids were on my floor as well because it was LOUD. If you get a good price and really don't care about your hotel then stay here for the food and location. If you are the least bit of a hotel snob, then stay somewhere else!",2,1

We didn't use any of the facilities that they charge for. You have to pay it regardless. Unless you're up at daft o'clock you'll struggle to get in elevators,  in mornings especially. We had breakfast in tick tock every morning and it was adequate enough and friendly. Struggled to understand receptionist when we checked in as her English was poor. Grudged every cent of facilities fee",2,1
I stayed here with my teenage daughter as her first trip to NY!  Someone had recommended this hotel to me however I was really disappointed:(  The hotel is out dated and over priced for what it provided!  The only thing it has going for it is that it is in an ideal location!,1,1

Found that once we'd booked and came to pay for the room once arrived there were 'hidden charges' which we were not informed about upon quote and booking confirmation had been received.

Sent an email upon check out and still had no response nor refund. Not impressed and wouldn't return!",2,1

On my previous stay in the city, I stayed in the Wellington Hotel which was rated less than the Wyndham New Yorker in all departments so I thought this hotel was going to be the real deal; how wrong was I?   Upon arriving we asked for an upgrade if there was anything available (at a fee of course, we were obviously wanting to pay for it). We were rudely told no and that there was nothing for the duration of our stay and when we asked if they had any king beds we were also rudely and aggressively told that they don't do king beds, only queen.

It is not easy to order room service - a menu is not provided in the room, nor the number required to dial, so you have to go through the front desk each time. The food from the Diner is good, however on the final day of my stay I waited over an hour for my meal because the member of staff who took my order had written my room number down incorrectly and when it finally arrived it came with the incorrect bill.

I haven't received my refund on the deposit or the second charge for my room they say 5 business days but I have no clue what's going to happen with that and I don't know if they are going to reimburse the overdraft fees I encured due to there mess up!

"Great central location and clean modern accommodation. Hotel had lovely interior design features nodding to the 1930's architecture. However we were stuck in a backroom with a view of walls and abandoned debris. We asked if we could swap rooms but were told this would not be a possibility. There was only a coffee machine in our room, no tea available. The coffee machine had no instructions and when I explained that I couldn't use it at reception, she asked me what I would like her to do about that!!! Rude. On top of this, the room was noisy at night with some air conditioning unit whirring or something- even if all controls were switched off. And there was only one thin duvet and it got cold at night. I didn/t get much sleep. Also we wanted to be able to access the skyline",2,1
"It is such a terrible experience for me and my family as we have missing items after our stay at this hotel.   First one bracelet went missing which I left at my night stand. I thought I simply dropped somewhere did not think someone would steal it as I also have iPads charging in the room. But it would be too obvious to make an iPad or a bag disappear.  Then the day we are checking out my mom noticed one of her watches went missing then I started to think maybe this is too much for a coincidence reoccurring again.   I was going to make a complaint but my mom wanted to check her bag once again. As we could not find it, we simply called the hotel. I spoke to an agent from lost and found but the issue is there is nothing you can do.  I will never ever step into this hotel or let",1,1
"We arrived early and stored our luggage until we could check in. The guy at the front desk told us to come back and check in at 2pm. When we came back, we were told that we had to wait half an hour for a room to be serviced. We did... But no room. We kept being told it would be ready shortly and waited an hour and 45 minutes, not checking in until 3:45. Staff were completely unapologetic despite wasting our time. We don't mind if check in is at 4pm, but don't tell us it's earlier and keep us waiting.   When we went to check out, a piece of paper had appeared under our door indicating they had charged us $27 for a processing fee each night we had stayed. When we asked what it was for, we were told it was Internet. So even though it says free wi fi, it's not. They actually charge",1,1
"Worse hotel I have been with.  Very old rooms. Waited 45 minutes to check in and check out.  They charge 2$ for every bag you want to store while you are waiting for your room. No hotel I have ever went to, charged me for stored luggage.  That was the reason I even bother writing a review.  Stay away from this hotel. You can find better in the same area at the same prices.",1,1
"Very very much people stay at this hotel. Long que when check in. The room was very small. WiFi works really bad. Room was not silent from the streetsound. When check out they debit a facility fee of 50 USD. I dont find any facilitys at all. On top floor they say it was a sky lounge. It was closed saturday and sundays. Hotel dont have any relaxing area at all. No, the pictures dont say the thruth. When go back i will never stay at this hotel again.",1,1
Nice location but hotel looks quite dated. Rooms nice but very small. There are a lot of hidden charges that they add onto your bill such as a service fee for internet and other things which really should be included in the price. Fees such as this seem to me to be more of a scam. Wait time to get to the check in desk also took a long time with not enough people on.,2,1
"At first I thought it would be great to stay here for the ""iconic"" reason but bad idea. It's in such horrible conditions!! I stayed on the 34th floor to avoid street noise but everything can be heard because the windows are thin. The rooms are literally 10'x10' and paint cracked every where!! Then people are obviously smoking because it's coming through my vents!! My allergies are on level extremely high!! I'm so annoyed with the long lines for the front desk. I wanted to complain there but didn't want to wait at the line so I'm here venting!! The $25 ""resort fee"" is ridiculous!! The internet barely works and who makes calls anymore on regular phones?!!! Ridiculous to charge $250 a night without the taxes. Basically $300 a night now.  I do have to say the staff were nice. Just",1,1
"I paid a good amount for a Queen Executive.  I didn't think it was worth it at all. The room was small compared with what I usually get for how much I paid. The bed was uncomfortable. The pillows felt as if they were inflated. The sheets were itchy. The bathroom sink was so small, there was water splashing everywhere. And finally, the hallway outside our room did not quiet down until 4 or 5 in morning.",1,1
Very busy hotel with ridiculous security. They are not friendly or pleasant and can be difficult when you want to enter the elevators. God help you if you do not meet their profiling standards. They will stop you and make you wish you were staying somewhere else which you will do after you stay there just once. I learn from my mistakes.....Do you?,1,1
"I've stayed in many hotels in New York, and never felt less excited about one than this Wyndham New Yorker. it's a factory, not a hotel. I am with a group so it wasn't up to me wehre to stay but I wish I wasn't here. The city has sooo many cooler places even at this price. Yes, the Lobby is nice, and it's close to Madison Square Garden, but they hassle you for your key every time you go to your room like British school masters.. I don't know what they think they are preventing.. hotel security used to be smart, intuative, now they hassle everyone, three guys block your way to your room at times, always at least one making you show them a white piece of paper or key.. it's just dumb.  It's hack like a TSA inspection and not why people come to new york. why not use the money spent",2,1
"Tiny room had neither coffee or ice close by . Room generally old and not attractive. ""Facility Fee"" merely added 25% to advertised low rate, quite misleading. Location is good for MSG, Times Sq Spend a bit more and enjoy your stay somewhere else!",1,1
We stayed in room 2550 for 1 night and could not believe how shabby the room was. For starters the bed was hard there was no coffee or tea making facilities which is a basic necessities in 2016. The bathroom is In Need of desperate repair as you can't take a bath without water leaking the seal around the bath is mouldy and had pubic hair around it and needs re-tiling there is no shabby chic about this hotel. Very disappointed tourists.,2,1
"The hotel and staff were great, both the location and the service.  The room was clean and well maintained.  However on the final day we received a bill for around $130 for 'facilities' which completely put a downer on the whole experience.  $130 for essentially using the internet for 5 days, as we did not use the gym or other facilities (which we were not offered or informed about).    Without this the experience would have been brilliant.",1,1
Decent location but don't be fooled by low room rates. You pay a $25 charge every day for the privilege of being in the hotel! So whatever your rate is add $25 a night min! Staff on the desk are rude and blunt. Not very helpful.  Rooms are small but clean. Gym is ok and Internet in the rooms but at $25 each day plus your room rate there are better places to stay for business and vacation as a regular visitor here,2,1
"Beware about staying at this property. They add new charges on top of a prepaid reservation. The clerk at the front desk has obviously dealt with many people like me who were surprised at the charge, so it is clear the company knows its marketing strategy involves deception and nevertheless stands by it. Also, after checking in, checking my reservation documents and such, and then calling the front dest to discuss, it is impossible to get anyone at the front desk and to get a return phone call.",1,1
I have going to WKC since 2000 and very little has changed EXCEPT the cost. Rooms are tooooooo old & not cleaned well.,2,1
"Pros  Location: Brilliant location. Within walking distance of Times Square and all the flagship stores on Fifth Avenue. Metro right next to hotel. At the same time, the area where the hotel is not Times Square noisy.  Quality of Bathroom Amenities: The soap, shampoo and conditioner are of high quality.  Tick Tock Diner: Loved the hotel diner which is open 24hrs.  Room: Room was small but comfortable. Adequate number of hangars.   Cons:  Hidden ""Facility Fee"": Published fares are non-inclusive of an extra $25/day ""facility fee."" Given there are no facilities in the hotel, when I asked what this fee is for, I was informed it was for and I quote, ""premium Wi-Fi, domestic/international calling etc."" If the hotel wants to charge for the Wi-Fi, then please don't advertise free Wi-Fi.",2,1
"For simplicity, this is a copy verbatim of the letter I sent to the General Manager after checkout. The management last night wanted to just say ""well, hotels have mice, we try. We moved you half naked at midnight, scared you.. Wasn't disruptive.""  Hello, After a long day in the city I was relaxing after a nice bath. I had not even gotten dressed yet, when I saw a mouse sitting atop my suitcase. This set a course of action in place which disrupted my night, embarrassed me, and made very uncomfortable. I requested first that someone come up as I feared it may have run into my suitcase. I also requested, as all my clothes were in my suitcase, that the person sent be female as I was in my room alone and scantily dressed. I received a call letting me know only men were available at",2,1
"After looking at the hotel website before travelling, lets just say I was hugely disappointed on arrival.  The photos on the website are really quite deceptive.  Walking down the corridors to the room, I already didn't have a good feel about the place.  Despite the sign displayed outisde the hotel advertising a new look for the hotel, I failed to see where there had been any renovations.  The carpets where worn down and grubby looking and the walls were the same.  It was the same once we entered the room and the bathroom was not very clean, dust and hairs were visable.  The place definitely needs updating!  I was quite angry on arrival as my husband had honestly thought he'd booked a decent hotel, to the point that we considered booking another hotel, however we decided to spend",2,1
"The sheets were very scratchy and the pillows were lumpy. The room was very drafty and small. I drove and had the car parked, attendant said allow 45 to 1 hour for pickup. I called in plenty of time and it took them 1 1/2 hours to deliver. They said it would be there in 45 minutes! Car had small scratch on it.",2,1
Not at all what I expect from Wyndham Hotels. Very small room and even smaller bathroom. Upon entering our room I noticed that the smoke alarm was wrapped in plastic. I notified the front desk who sent two security guards who took pictures and said they would send someone to remove it. I removed it myself several hours later before going to sleep. Apparently my smoke free room wasn't for the previous guests.  I was never notified that I would be sharing this hotel with over 100 dogs. It seems the dog show was in town that weekend. I should have been told this when I booked the room and I would have booked somewhere else. Dogs in the lobby dogs in the elevators is not what I expected when paying that kind of money!,2,1
"Stayed here for one night to meet friends for an evening in New York. The hotel is set up for volume and is obviously extremely convenient for Madison Square Garden, so gets a wide variety of clientele from tourists to show-goers to business conference people. Rooms could use some updating but the views from upper floors can be good. Unfortunately the night we were there the people in the next door room were having a major party, with at least half a dozen people clearly getting drunk, screaming and laughing, banging things around, TV volume turned up high, slamming doors. The walls are very thin so we could hear everything.  xThey did not stop until 3.30am and then we could hear them retching and coughing in the morning at 8am. Worst night's sleep I have had for a long time.",2,1
"Aside from not having amenities of common standards to hotel across the country,  THIS hotels methods of unethical operations as ot pertains to erroneous charges to my credit card for room service and restaurant meals that were in fact never had or received to my credit card is despicable.  Needless to say that I will without fail dispute ALL charges made without warrant. I will NEVER recommend THIS hotel to any colleague or individual .  Completely annoyed, Dr. K'jerrel A. Smith, PhD",1,1
"Stayed in the New Yorker hotel  , in shabby old room, with impolite staff, and dogs barking in the room next door at all hours!!! Will not recommend this hotel. Asked for late check out and was told it would be $150  for 5 extra hours! Do yourselves a favour and stay in hostel if you want this kind of room and service! Only rating two due to location  and that was generous! Good luck if you go to this hotel...",2,1
The hotel is dirty and rooms are outdated the staff is really nice and helpful but I would not recommend to another person,1,1
"Very unpleasant. The images placed online are very misleading. The rooms are tiny, bathroom is very old fashioned and lobby needs some major cleaning. Not to mention, my sheets had hair that did not belong to me nor my boyfriend. Seems like the housekeepers aren't doing their jobs very cautiously. I also had an incident in the lobby where as any other guest should go up to their room waiting in the elevator banks an employee,a middle aged African American lady, approached me. She asked me to pull out my state issued id as there were about 10 other people surrounding me. Then she also asked me to show her my hotel room key. This made me feel extremely uncomfortable because she did not asked anyone else for identification but me. Unprofessional much? I called the manager regarding",1,1
"Nothing to recommend. Service was poor and staff was hostile, and the rooms were very shabby. Beds are small, there are few amenities, and nothing is very clean. Internet is slow. There really is nothing good about this place, and the paint was peeling all around the bathroom. For the money, you can do MUCH better.",2,1
It seemed a lot of people like us had paid for internet and free phone calls which is extra and you have to pay it. but until you moaned several times the hotel didnt fix it. The rooms need updating and the windows are very old so you can hear a lot of noise from the city that never sleeps. Cleaners were fantastic and very helpful. I wouldnt stay at the hotel again.,2,1
"Traveled with a student group and the check in desk was a nightmare. The process took 2.5 hours starting at 245 pm and ending after 5! They were so incompetent. I finally had to take the check in for the entire group and then check for my students assigned rooms that stretched over 5 floors for 22 students. The chaperones were on a different floor. The hotel could not understand how that could be a problem. Two days into the trip, one of the girls room found cock roaches in the bed. My room was adequate, but the kids rooms were tiny. It was ok but not a good interaction with staff.",2,1
"I made a reservation with Wyndham for a recent stay but never received any type of confirmation.  I called about 6 weeks before and was repeatedly told that I did not have a reservation at this hotel or any Wyndham hotel in Manhattan.  I gave them my name over and over and spelled it out multiple times, gave them my credit card information, check in and out dates, and still nothing.   I was forced to start my hotel shopping over again and ended up booking the Courtyard by Marriott, which happened to be on the next block.  This was a major inconvenience of my time of having to search prices and locations all over again, but I really had no choice.    When I checked my credit card after the check in date, there was a $614.14 charge from the hotel.  I called the number provided,",1,1
"I am not sure If i just ended up getting a horrible room because I price lined this hotel, but I got a double bed room for four people during New Years. First, the beds were a tad bit bigger than twin beds, smaller than fulls. My husband is a big guy so that it was very uncomfortable. What turned me off most about the hotel room was the bathrooms. They were disgusting. The toilet is a small, 1970's toilet. My husband and our friend joked that only one of their butt cheeks would fit on this. My husband isn't fat by any means, he's a body builder so he's buff. Second thing about the bathrooms, there isn't a space next to the sink (vanity). Its literally just the sink. So you can't put your makeup products/hair products, let alone get ready in the bathroom at all. The bathroom can",1,1
"You expect fees like state taxes, tourism fees (which btw are normally not supposed to be passed on to the customer) etc on your bill. You DON'T expect a 25.00 Plus Tax fee for being a customer.  Disclose this upfront - better yet build it in to your rates.  Furthermore - some people don't use the pool, fitness centre, business centre, etc... and wi-fi should be either included in the rate or charged at a minimal rate of around 10.00 a night. Charging a ""resort"" style fee thats not disclosed in the rate is underhanded and false advertising.  Charging ME for what are basics in a hotel is ridiculous.  To clarify - an advertised rate of 88 a night - turned out to be 130...!! 130!!!?? that's crazy. (that's just their room charges - no food or chosen services added). This hotel's",2,1
"At check-in, we were excited to learn we had received an upgrade.  Upon seeing the room, the excitement vanished.  Small does not begin to describe the room, even by NYC standards.  The mattresses sunk in the middle making it impossible for our family of four to sleep comfortably.  The sink design made it impossible to wash our hands without drenching our clothing.  And, at check-in, the only time our credit card was not in our possession, the card was compromised and used at another NYC hotel, necessitating the deactivation of our credit card while traveling out of town with our family. The hotel was unwilling to offer assistance, aside from one phone call asking for a few details, but no follow up or expression of concern, apology, or understanding for out difficulties.  We",1,1
"I am SHOCKED that this hotel could have so many favorable reviews on TripAdvisor. The hotel prides itself on its Art Deco architecture, but that just means that your bathroom hasn't been renovated since the 1920s. The rooms are extremely small (I've been in larger rooms in Europe) - case in point, I had about 10 inches between the edge of the bed and the media console. As I said before, the bathroom is extremely small, with chipping tiles and almost no counter space (we had a ledge of about 4"" deep to store toiletries). Yes, the location is convenient, but expect more noise as a result (but this is nearly unavoidable in NYC) and panhandlers in the lobby. We also didn't appreciate hassle with having your hotel card looked at every time you enter since there are no card readers in",2,1
"I like the location of the hotel which is why I use it when I'm in NYC but it could be vastly improved. I book via Expedia and am an 'Elite' member which should give preferential treatment and upgrades to hotels that are part of the Expedia  'VIP' booking program (which the New Yorker does). However, when I arrived, the front desk staff had no record of my status and were not at all interested in contacting Expedia to rectify the situation and so gave me an old, dark and basic room little bigger than a prison cell! After spending a while on the phone to Expedia, they corrected their mistake and instructed the hotel to give me the room that I should have had. The better rooms at the hotel are OK but the attitude of the front desk staff leaves a great deal to be desired!",2,1
"i remember staying in New Yorker before it was taken over by Wyndham and ""renovated"" and the stay was much better. Nowadays, walls are paper thin, you hear everything in the hallway and room next door. Terrible experience, would not stay here again.",2,1
Given its handy proximity to the centre of New York I was going to err on the positive when it came to writing this review even though I have stayed in more impressive 2* hotel. So I had planned to emphasise that the fact that the public areas and  room were kept lovely and clean. Some of the staff were friendly and helpful. HOWEVER the additional unexpected charge of the equivalent to £20 PER DAY called a FACILITY FEE totally overshadowed the few positives. I had already pre paid in a package deal for my 5 night stay. I had no extras in the very small basic double room which had no mini bar or drink making facility but on check out got an equivalent to £100 bill. When I questioned this I was told in a very abrupt manner that this was a facility fee for use of the business,1,1
"The hotel lobby is nice, but the rooms, and especially the bathrooms, are badly in need of restoration. The tile in the bathroom in the room where I stayed was painted a sick green color, and the paint was chipping off. Both the room and bathroom were very worn out. The staff is friendly, and service is good. They just need to update the rooms!",2,1
"This hotel really is awful from beginning to end about the only positive thing I can say about it is that the location is good! We've stayed in Manhattan many times and are aware that hotel rooms tend to be small but this was literally a postage stamp size! The receptionist Driss was friendly and tried to appoint us with his best available ""modern"" room on the 29th floor but when we got up there not only was it tiny and smaller than a double bed but there was fake tan stains and hairs on the sheets, when I went down to complain the manager asked could he send someone up to change the sheets and didn't seem shocked at all! I refused and asked for a new room, we were given one on the 34th floor, the corridors were filthy with dirty tissues and an awful smell the room was tiny",1,1
"With this extremely old hotel i had to face issues like horrible garbage smell , extremely small rooms and even worse, careless staff members. I addressed the smell issues twice and they didn't take care of it. Need serious upgrades. Not coming back.",1,1
"Well, not quite sure where to start. I took my wife, 10 year old child and mother in law, paid for a 2 room suite, when I arrived I was told there had been a leak and that I would not be able to stay in my room and I would have to stay in a double room for the first night.. This would of been fine if I was just with my wife, but for our 10 year old child and mother in law of 61 to sleep on a single chair that was apparently a double pull out bed was never going to work. However, after complaining they eventually gave us a room with 2 double beds, with an air condition that sounded like a Boeing 747 engine. So hot and stuffy we remained for the rest of the night. The next morning I asked if I could have the room we booked for. I was then told my bank card was declined and I never",1,1
"I would not stay if I was you. when I got to the room there was a used condom on the floor. when I called to the front desk the manager had an attitude at first. he assured me that he would refund one night for me. that never happened when I called back he said he was going to look into it and call me back, well its been over a week and still no call. the rooms are very small and if you try and have any food delivered to the room you cant. the security at the hotel said u have come down and get it. pick a different hotel and you'll have a better trip.",1,1
"I visited for 2 nights on business, and being my first time in New York was immediately shocked by the tiny size of the room!! It had all the amenities I needed so I was not lacking anything. However, it is the most aged and tired looking hotel I have ever stayed at. I'm not one for quirky charm of the past and if my budget had afforded it - would have stayed somewhere newer and more modern. Regardless, it is a great location and thankfully I only had to sleep there (although it is super loud on the streets all night long even though I was 20 floors up - and the bed was slanted and not comfortable at all lol) my back is against the door in the pic I have included. Looks nice - but it's deceiving! The great part was that I had a short walk to Times Square for some sight seeing",2,1
"Unfortuanetely, my friends and I stayed at this disgusting hotel for my birthday. It seemed great at first, until the morning we were checkin-out. My two friends were both sick (it's December...) and they both had a bad cough. That morning, a man from the front desk knocked on our door and said someone had complained we were smoking....None of us smoke and the room didn't even smell. My friend told him we weren't smoking and he just left. How rude! We were quickly getting ready and suddenly we saw a cockroach crawl across the room. EW!!!! We all screamed so loud. My one friend jumped on the bed, the other jumped in the bathtub, and I jumped on the chair. 3 girls 1 cockroach, real classy. I called housekeeping after waiting for front desk to pick up for sooooo long (fantastic",1,1
"We stayed @ the NYer a few years back & the room had a great view but was very run down (especially the bathroom). When we noticed that Wyndham now runs it & we saw how beautiful the lobby was renovated, we couldn't wait to see our room - nice headboard, sheets & curtains - bed very hard, toilet too low, bathtub/shower old, moldy & a little scary, carpet old, musty smell in the hallway. Great location & friendly, capable staff.",2,1
A recent stay at the New Yorker was a huge disappointment.  No any think like the pictures on their website.  I expected the room to be small as many hotel rooms in NYC are on the small side.  This room looks like the last time it was renovated was just after WW II. The room was out dated and not even a comfortable chair to sit and read not that there was room for one.  It is a convenient location within walking distance of much of the city but not a very comfy or welcoming room to stay in.  Also for a hotel this size there were very few seats in the lobby.  More often then not all the couches and seats were full.  Sixty dollars at night to park.  WOW.,2,1
"We booked this hotel as a base for our holiday in New York. Upon arriving, we were checked in and asked to sign for hidden charges that we had not been told about - this included a $25 a DAY charge to use the services in the hotel. When questioned about this a rude receptionist told us that it would allow us to use the hotel's FREE internet, as well as the fitness studio (which we had no interest in using), the business suite (we were there for a holiday) and a poorly put together exhibition. After much debate, this charge was removed from the bill.  Upon entering the room, we found it to be average in terms of furnishing however, there was no kettle, mini bar or additional facilities in the room.

"I had a bad experience with the hotel rate at The New Yorker Hotel in New York City, a Wyndham Hotel...  I booked this through Expedia.  Two weeks before the trip, I called the hotel to confirm our rooms and the rate.  We had two rooms.  The hotel told me it was $488.00.  I asked if that was for both rooms?  $244.00 per room.  The hotel said yes.  Then we got the bill.....$488.00 per room.   I called Wyndham Hotel Group in Parsippany, NJ and thought I could maybe get a small refund ( not unreasonable)on both rooms to ease the pain but they reused.  I thought this was unfair.",1,1
"We paid £675 for 4 nights here!! All the staff in this hotel are pretty much New York rude!! No one smiles, no ones friendly and no one really wants to help you. Probably the worse hotel customer service we have ever had! Our first room on 29th floor (corridor was dirty and needed a huge make over) I think it was, was totally impractical, it was so small you had no where to put luggage & we had two suit cases! You have you place them buy the TV or somewhere & constantly walk round them! It had a horrible colour scheme so dark it was an 80 year old room!!! It kinda had half a view nothing wow. I complained and thank god the moved us to the newly refurbished 7th floor the room was 100% better white clean walls and great shower. Room for the bags inside the wardrobe but it was tiny",1,1
"While this place has art deco charm when you first enter the lobby, entering the room loses that charm right away.  Small even for NYC, it doesn't seem like this place has been updated in decades.",2,1
"When you pay this much for a hotel you expect absolute top service. When we arrived the staff at reception were nonchalant, rather than welcoming. We were also surprised with a $25 fee Per night fee for use of facilities (which includes the business centre and gym both of which we have no intention of using on a holiday) and were told it was mandatory. There is no tea/coffee making facilities in the room and we only discovered on the last night that you are able to ask for a coffee maker to be sent to your room - I only discovered this as I was feeling unwell and asked for hot water - it took 45 minutes for the machine to be delivered to the room. Water pressure in shower is poor and water gets colder as the day goes by. Despite all this the location is fantastic, the beds are",2,1
"While the New Yorker has a good location, the rest of the experience doesn't live up to Wyndham's supposed 4-star rating for this hotel (though inflated star ratings seem to be common throughout the chain). The front desk staff here is only efficient, but not friendly, and long lines pervade check-in and bag check. The rooms are smaller than one would expect, even for a hotel in New York, and the furnishings are low-quality and sometimes in disrepair.",2,1
"Recently stayed at Wyndham New Yorker, the bedroom was extremely small and because there was a heavy desk against the window, the curtain would only pull halfway across.  The view seemed to be of other rooms which I could see into when the lights were on so I had to move the desk in order to block their view into my room.  The bed was very comfortable although the room itself was small and extremely cold at night.  I did ask for another blanket which was supplied immediately on request.  The bathroom was very cramped and dated. Luckily I was the sole occupant as I doubt you could get two into the room at the same time.  Location was good, the staff were friendly and the TickTock restaurant was excellent.  Sometimes there was a queue for breakfast but the food and service was",2,1
"VERY RUDE receptionist helped us when we checked in.If we did not already pay in full we would have left and gone to another hotel.Felt very unwelcome.Average rooms, old mouldy bathrooms.Definitely NOT a 4 star hotel.There is no coffee/tea facilities in the room.No bar fridge.Very dissapointed.",2,1
"My stay at the New Yorker was extremely good, the location perfect and all staff so friendly.  HOWEVER, more than a week after check out, this hotel has still failed to re-debit my account with over £1500!   I have paid for my stay, had to endure multiple conversations with clueless financial staff members and with still no resolution! I have paid for this room and with no prior warning I am now facing financial repercussions!  I chose this hotel because it was affordable and a great location! Only 50% of this I can now say to be true!  £1500 short at Christmas is NOT acceptable. Be warned!!",2,1
"Over priced- dirty, old rooms, mouldy bathroom, cold rooms, drafty windows, smelly bathroom, charges for 'service' 27 dollars a day, rude staff, small toiletries. Be aware price on booking.com will be vastly inflated when you check out (4 types of taxes, and service charge). I have stayed elsewhere in New York ie the kimpton hotels and have not felt ripped off like here. Do not book!!!!",1,1
"You can't deny the charm of the building, but rooms are so run down small and antiquated it really should be maximum a 2 or 3 star property. Staff is great but they can't help the state of the building. At almost $375 it's absolute horrible value for money even for NYC.",2,1
"This is my first review ever, about anything, but I strongly feel I have to share this experience with other potential hotel customers so that at the very least, they are not sourly surprised like we were. First, I'd like to say that the hotel's location in Midtown Manhattan is very good and it is a historic hotel with a very nice Lobby. Stayed at this hotel because it is a Wyndham hotel and I had never had a bad experience like this one, under the Wyndham flag. There is a musky smell once you get off the elevator that really turns you off as you are led to your minuscule room. My family (13yr son, 16yr daugther, wife and myself) literally had to take turns and coordinate ourselves to move about the room.  This room is aprox. 10'x11' with two full sized beds, counter for TV set",1,1
"Recently stayed at the New Yorker Hotel in November 2015 for 3 days on a business trip. The guest in the room next to mine was smoking during my entire stay and the smoke was permeating into my room.  I have Reactive Airway Disease and cigarette smoke is a trigger.  I phoned guest services daily and reported this.  They sent security up and I was informed they could smell the smoke however, there is nothing they could do unless they are ""caught"" smoking.  I stopped at the front desk on several occasions and again no attempt to correct the problem.  I was only able to stay in my room to sleep and had to leave the room and complete my computer and administrative work elsewhere.  The day I was departing I left 5 hours prior to my flight   because I could not tolerate the smoke.  I",1,1
"Staying at the Wyndham New Yorker for 4 nights, room is very very small with no amenities.  No fridge, no coffee, plastic beakers and room very cold.  The Tick Tock restaurant which is attached to the hotel offers very good food but the service is indifferent bordering on surly, but a tip of 20 per cent is still expected.",2,1
"Room was very dated and  the bathroom was awful. Shower was hot or cold, no in between. For $300+ per night I expect a decent shower.",2,1
The only good about this hotel is the location. When you view the pictures of the rooms & hotel it looks great but in person it's a major disappointment. The room is very small and tight as well as the bathroom you barley have any room to do your business the tv is small the prices are high. The hotel charges an additional 27 nightly because of their self proclaimed great wifi and other b.s amenities. This place nickels & dimes their customers you get charged a 2 dollar fee just to leave your luggage for a few hours after check out. If you have money to blow this is the place to stay.,2,1
"Yes, the price is good but the hotel is awful. It's a good example of ""you get what you pay for.""  I called in advance and was told I could possibly check in early so I took a chance figuring I'd check my luggage if I couldn't then come back later. I arrived at noon on a Saturday. The lobby was mobbed. The line to check looked like more than 20 people. The line to check luggage looked even longer like more than 40 people. I waited about 15-20 minutes in the check-in line and made it to the desk. I was informed I could not check in early. I didn't have time to wait in the luggage check-in line so I left with my luggage.  I returned at 10:30pm and checked in without delay. I went to the elevator and while there were many cars they were very slow to arrive. There were more people",1,1
"This hotel is in a prime location opposite Madison square garden, with views of the Empire State, but that's all it had going for it.  We booked a room for us and our adult son, but the only bathroom in the room was in our bedroom!  He didn't want to come into our room neither did we want him to.  The staff were very reasonable and moved us into a room with 2 bathrooms.  We were assured that the 2nd bed would be made up, as it was a sofa bed, but on 3 occasions we had to pull this out and make it ourselves.  One morning we woke up to a mess where a rodent of some kind had chewed through a carrier bag and packaging and eaten chocolate that we had bought as a gift.   The manager was supposed to call us up that day as we didn't want to wait in, but this never happened.  When we",2,1
"First of all, this hotel or Wyndham just need to disappear.  Checked in on a Saturday.  Had reserved the room for 4 nights.  Lobby was big but nothing really going for it.  The front desk gave me a room on the 27th floor.  I thought to myself great I will have a decent view.  Not only did I not get a decfent view, I got a loset sized room with barely space for one of us leet alone two people in there.  There was peeling paint everywhere.  Old gross doors you were afraid to open because you were not sure what you will find behind the walls.  I always check the bathrooms before I make myself comfortable so you can guess what I found had me horrified.  Black spots all over the nasty old white time, peeling paint, and gualk from the tiles.  Oh god it was vile.  You think I stepped",1,1
"Suffice it to say that the Wyndham NewYorker Hotel is an iconic building in Manhattan for decades - however the Wyndham renovation project does NOT do the building justice at all.   Lipstick switch more so than real renovation, the Wyndham project is an absolutely bust in my opinion. From the paranoid and illogical customer service (day managers included), to the thick smokey smelling hallways, to the extra small quarters (old hotels typically offer much larger rooms), this hotel stay disappoints on many levels.  While I was attending the DMFS conference, the conference facilities are cramped, only partially renovated (lipstick on a pig) and inadequate for the needs of the paying sponsors.  Wyndham Hotels and Resorts should stick to secondary markets with their Walmart quality",2,1
"This was the worst hotel room, in size and appearance, we have ever stayed in for the last 50 years. The hotel nickeled and dimed every movement, even charging $2.00 to store one small piece of luggage.  It ruined our 50th wedding anniversary travels to all the special places in our life from California to New York.",1,1
"The hotel is in a convenient location for getting around the sights of New York and accessing public transport, even if the neighbourhood itself isn't the most appealing.  The hotel is rather run down and the rooms fairly small, albeit that is reflected in the price (generally cheaper than other central NY hotels).  All this would probably have given a 3 star rating. However about a week after I returned I checked my credit card statement to find they had taken a $60 charge from my account (which I had not authorised). Bizarrely the charge was dated a couple of days after we had checked out and was for valet parking (we didn't take a car). There was no mention of the charge at check out.  The money was refunded (or 'adjusted' to use their words) after some email correspondence,",1,1
"Ok, so it's New York. Everything is expensive, as is this hotel.  But firstly, the check in desk, should people really have to wait 30 mins plus just to get to the reception desk. And then be told it was too early to check in, so 75 bucks or else. Not prepared to wait another 30 mins later in the day, I stump up, looking forward to the room with the view of the Hudson River, or the Empire State Building that I paid for.  I get scaffold and the building next door. So, later on I go down an complain, apparently it has been the bain of their life this year, people being promised such rooms.  Don't advertise them on you websit then .... So no room available that night, but pack up everything in the morning, and the cases will be in the room when you get back at 6.00. We get back at",2,1
"I was very disappointed in the conditions of my room. Upon arrival, I waited 15 minutes in the check in line and there was only one person at the counter. I arrived at my room and the door had been propped open and the room was dark. Needless to say, that was a bit concerning. I had my husband stay on the phone with me while I checked the room. Once I assured him that no one was in the room, I closed the door and took off my shoes, only to find that the floor was damp. I requested a new room, which was better but still underwhelming. The tv didn't work, one of my towels had hair on it (gross) and so on. I would not recommend this hotel and would not stay there again.",2,1
"Hotel looks grand, rooms are clean but generally run down. The rooms were very cramp to the extent that my luggage had to be carried in. No bedroom slippers provided. No drinking water too. Beds were small and not very comfortable. Location is not ideal as it is around 15 streets from bus terminal and times sq.   All these I could tolerate. However the hotel staff were not very polite. There was a day where I slept in till 9am. The housekeeping came, opened the door, and shouted at me saying ""for goodness sake, hang the do not disturb sign outside!"" Continued making a lot of noise to show her unhappiness. That same day, I checked out and paid for $2 per piece of luggage to be kept in the luggage room. I returned to the hotel to freshen up before my flight and requested to know",1,1
"Only had 2 nights for a business trip, however I wouldn't stay here again. Very dated building and scruffy interior and rooms. Great location but just not comfortable at all, tiny tiny rooms (and I travel alot) overall very disappointing.",2,1
"Here is my absolute disgust at the experience I had while staying at the Wyndham New Yorker in October 2015.  Prior to my arrival I was sent a text message with a link to an online check-in facility, where I followed the instructions, and yet, when I arrived, I still had to wait in line for 20 minutes to check in. What was the online process for ?  I had ordered a room with a ""Metro view"", and I paid extra for it. When I got into the room, I was shocked to see that it was a tiny, maybe 10'x10' room, staring into an alley. What happened to the Metro view ?  When I inquired downstairs with the manager, I was directed to another room, maybe 11'x11', and again, staring into some far-flung corner of Manhattan. I went back downstairs and complained that this was the same problem I",1,1
Went purely on some reviews I had read and pictures... And all I can say is other than the location this is simply a roof for the night nothing special at all!! Hotel lobby is beautiful... The rest seems like a rundown motel! Bathroom looks like it's from the 30s and the room which was supposed to be a deluxe is like a box!! Would not stay again,2,1
"This place is just terrible, terrible, terrible.  The bathroom was full of rust, mold, and some weird green gunk leaking out of the toilet handle.  The pics somehow make this place look decent, which is a stretch in and of itself.  The bathroom was seriously gross.   There is no refrigerator in the room and barely room to lay down your things.  The AC had a mind of its own, just decided to go on and off as it pleased.  The housekeeping would keep coming in the room even though I left the note on the door to not be disturbed.  I would not recommend my worst enemy stay at this dump.   Yes the location is in midtown which is convenient, but hey this is New York, almost everywhere is convenient.",2,1
"I can't imagine how anyone would give this hotel 5 stars, or even 4.  This would be near the bottom of all the places we've stayed in NYC.  Staff was extremely rude at check-in, basically yelling at us because the door to the room they initially put us in was broken (refusing to move us to another room, etc.).  They gave us some free vouchers for continental breakfast at the diner, but we regretted using those; sometimes free still isn't cheap enough, especially in a city like New York where there is so much good food to be had. The only real positive is the location, very convenient if you are arriving or departing by train.  The 'Art Deco' lobby is fine but the upper floors of the hotel look dirty and poorly maintained.  A 2-star hotel masquerading as 4-star.  You can do so",2,1
"A friend and me stayed at the New Yorker as we wanted to be in the city.  To start with we didn't get the rooms we asked for and were asked to move to other rooms.  the attitude of all the staff was terrible.  The room was fine, however early towards 5am we woke up with someone trying to open our door and after continuosly trying for sometime he peed on our door with his pee flowing into the room.  We called the front desk and told them and they said they would send security.  No security showed up at all.  The guy however was from the opposite room.  This was one of my most disgusting experiences.",2,1
"Well, to start the food was amazing.. I really must say they pay attention to detail..our room was extremely clean, we were very satisfied with our service..felt like a King and Queen, I really do suggest that you try this place..I""m sure you will be satisfied",2,1
"Our experience in the New Yorker Hotel: disapointing.  Having seen the pictures of the Art Deco hotel, we were waiting for these kinds of hotel that give you unforgetables memories. I think that New Yorker used to such a hotel, but not anymore.  In the hotel now, it seems that the strictly miminum is done.First at all, personal is simply unpleasant. At the check'in, we've the deep impression to be nothing else that a reservation number, no smile and no welcome. Regarding to the price of the room (small and sad) and the history of the building, this is simply inaceptable.  As an example: keeping our luggage need additional fees (2$ by item). I clearly consider that such a service shall be part of the service offered by an hotel of this standard, there is also no basic equipment",1,1
"Caution, the management sticks you in areas that have not been remodeled and they STINK! Our bathroom walls were dirty with various forms of DNA of unknown origin and the fixtures appeared to have been there since the hotel was built in 1929. At first we were placed in room 3207 and that was like a trip to the twilight zone of weird funk.  Our second room was room 856 which was better but the shower wasn't working, which when combined with the first bad room gave me a really BAD impression. It took them 5 hours  The cleaning staff clearly doesn't pay attention to detail, just look for the dust in the bathroom, cigarette burn on the toilet lid, and the fixtures aren't wiped down properly as demonstrated by the water stains.  Room 3207 was ghastly and I would recommend firing the",1,1
"If you stay at the New Yorker, they charge you an additional $25 facilities fee that is not included in your room fee.  It is nonsense.",2,1
"The hotel is very old and has a lot of history, but sadly, they are not keeping it in shape. The room I stayed in was on the 37th floor, which provides a nice view, but sadly the windows didn't close completely, so their was a constant chilly breeze in the room and I had to put the AC on warming running all the time.  The rooms are very small, but that is common in New York, but there wasn't even at water cooker or coffee machine in the rooms, which is normally standard, especially at this price range. It was impossible to get the shower on a constant temperature and sometimes there was no hot water at all.  The staff was friendly, but there were long waiting time for everything, especially the reception was constantly understaffed and waiting times of 20 to 30 minutes. Also",2,1
"The hotel employees went out of their way to be extraordinarily rude and belligerent. I observed hotel staff assault at least two other guests--believe me, if one even touched me I would own that building right now. I can't imagine what kind of training the administration is providing, Could not recommend less.",1,1
"Tiny room was vintage (in a bad way) and really worn out looking.  The whole bathroom -- tiles, sink, tub were covered with old peeling epoxy finish. Constant thumping noise 24/7 from elevator.  Long lines at check in.  Computer problems at check out.  And, a $25 per night facility fee..who are they kidding?",1,1
"First of all, the room you reserve online (pictured) is NOT the room you'll get. Paid ahead of trip for 3 nights - when we arrived, we had a room right off the elevators!  AND not bigger than a 12' X 12'.  You opened the door and took one step in and landed on the bed!  On the other side of the bed was the window that overlooked the next building's brick wall - not the metro view of the empire state building as advertised!  Everything was old - no space to open suitcase, no coffee maker etc... we went to ask for an upgrade; they said they would give us a room with two beds only that it wasn't available on the first night.  So when we went down the following morning, they said they would make sure housekeeping gets to the room quickly.... 4 hours later, because they couldn't",2,1
"I stayed at this hotel from Thursday (9/17/15) to Tuesday (9/22/15) for a business trip.   My stay at this hotel was adequate until Saturday (9/19). I woke to find a small black thing in my bed, but I honestly tried to block it out of my mind. I didn’t think anything of it until Monday morning (9/20), when I went to work and started itching all over my legs. My coworkers and I found bite marks in groups of three all over. I immediately called the hotel to speak to a manager, I emailed pictures of the bite marks per the manager’s request, and I asked that my room be inspected at once since I had to stay there for two more days. The manager instructed me to come to the desk as soon as I returned to the hotel from work; they would be happy to move me into a new room.   I returned",1,1
"I've stayed here a few times happily. While rooms are a bit small, that's not unusual for New York. Everything is clean, staff is friendly, and above all it's right next to Penn Station which is ideal for me. But this time I was rankled by having a mandatory ""Facility Charge"" of $25 per night added to the room. Effectively this is a sneaky way of increasing the room rate. While it's not much it makes me less keen to stay in this, or other Wyndham hotels, in the future.",2,1
"We had a Rocky Horror convention this weekend. We had no con block which the hotel i think didn't think it is a nessasity for this kind of a con.  The rooms were too small. You couldn't move in the room. The Wifi was wanky all the time. The lobby wifi was o.k but the wifi for the rooms. So bad.  The price was too high for this kind of a hotel, although the pope was in town. You would expect that if you are paying that much you will be getting something more than that.",2,1
"This was my fourth trip to New York. We don't book rooms for luxury as you're not in them for any length of time in New York, however upon check in we were told that we had been upgraded for free to a room with a view and a queen sized bed. When we got to the room we were sorely disappointed. It was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in. We checked online to see if any of the advertised photographs were reflective of this room or the size of the room and they weren't. There were hardly any plugs in the room and so you had to do your ironing in the bathroom, however the ironing board didn't fit in the bathroom so you had to block the doorway to the bathroom with it. The shower ran hot and cold, no matter how often you changed the dials you would freeze one minute and be",2,1
"Enter the room and first thing you notice is multiple layers of paint, old door knobs, dusty aluminum windows from the 80s renovation efforts, ancient hardware in bathroom, sink that doesn't drain quick enough and starts to fill up rather quickly, shower tub is painted over, several dark spots in the bathroom where anything can crawl out, I mean common!!! Can imagine what the food prep area would be like. I originally booked for 9 nights but promptly checked out after the first night.",1,1
"We are here for three days. We would have moved the moment we got to our room--which was slightly smaller than my suitcase--if we had not convinced them to upgrade us to a suite. The suite is definitely larger and it has a view--but it is just as depressing. If they spent $70M on renovations, I'm not seeing it. We will never stay here again. It may be cheaper than other NYC options, but tired and tattered is not why you come to NYC.",2,1
"I stayed here for work. The rate was over $300 per night. The room was small and it had been a long while since it had been pained etc. The paint had scratches everywhere. There was no coffee or tea in the room. The shower was old, and sprayed water on one of the windows. I had to call twice for a toothbrush to be brought up to the room.  The fitness room was excellent. The location is good too.",2,1
"Spent 3 days in NY. The price was not indicative in the quality of the room.  The room was small. The bathroom was dated, the bathtub was small. The door frame of the bathroom was rotting at the base. The paint of all the doors was in a very poor state.  Nothing else needs to be said.",2,1
Paid for an upgrade but the double bed just fitted into the room. While it was clean & the bed just confortable enough. I wouldn't stay there again. The room was on the 8th floor. There was a large air conditioner just below us which was noisy all night. Slept with my Bose noise cancelling head phones on. The foyer is nice.,2,1
"On the positive side, this hotel has a very unique Art Deco ambiance which is very attractive when viewed at a distance.  In reality, it is evident that many of the Art Deco features have been ""preserved"" as is (i.e.: broken) rather than restored, largely in an effort to save money. Wear and tear is evident beyond what would be expected of a hotel in the price range. Art Deco ""features"" include antiquated bathroom fixtures and showers that take a long time to deliver adequate hot water at times outside of ""normal"" shower times (i.e.: if you are arriving from a long flight or leaving for an early flight and want a shower not in the morning hours, be prepared to wait a few minutes for hot water).  The beds were adequately clean, but were of a low grade of mattress that was",1,1

"We booked a family trip to celebrate our daughters 21st & sons 18th Birthdays . We booked two separate rooms , which in turn have given two very different opinions of a rather  disappointing  stay at the Wyndham !     The Girls room .. The overwhelming smell of damp hit me as I opened the door , probably caused by the wet carpet ! The bathroom had a mind of its own , the shower watered the  whole room ( not its not a fancy wet room ) the shower .. Started / stopped went from hot/ cold without having so much as to touch a button !  The air conditioning unit was noisy & smelly  but don't worry that was only when it worked !!!  We had no plugs near a mirror ( remember this is the girls room ) but we were rather inventive , & plugged it into a walled TV unit 😳.. On the plus side",1,1
"We booked this hotel through American Sky under their recommendation. This our first and probably only visit to NYC and we wanted it to be good, we were excited at the prospect of visiting this amazing city and the rich history of this Art Deco hotel would enrich the trip.  We spent our days walking everywhere, taking in the sights and sounds of this city, on the list were the usual tourist sights including the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, grand Central Terminal and walked the length of Central Park taking in the MMoA and the Guggenheim.  The hotel was central enough for us to manage all of these sights fairly easily on foot.  We had booked in for four nights in a standard room but we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a refurbished room on the 8th floor.  This",2,1

As a finale to our trip stateside I had booked a night in a view room and requested both on booking and shortly before arrival by email an Empire State view I appreciate requests cannot always be honoured but politeness can be expected. We queued to check in and were greeted by Jose who demanded a credit card for payment of extra charges, I said we had paid the full cost ahead, he demanded to see our booking documents which after some searching I managed to find and these confirmed that the rate included 'all taxes fees and local charges' despite this Jose sneered that it did not include 'resort fees' which were for wifi business services and fitness (",1,1

Service fees for unwanted services that are apparently ""mandatory"" they tell you that your room has a queen sized bed when it is not and the staff at reception have a serious attitude problem.

I have just had a bill slipped through my door for $89.27.   My girlfriend and I watched a pay-per-view movie at the cost of $7.61, the rest was what that call a ""facility fee""......

However they seem to be charging us for facilities that we have not used. A gym, a business centre a phone charge",1,1
This is a pleasant hotel with nicely refurbished rooms - however my experience was blighted by the allocation of incorrect rooms that the hotel could not rectify and billing errors (in the hotels favour!). I also needed to contact the hotel post departure regards some lost property but this proved very expensive as the website advertised email address for guest services does not work :( I had pre-booked 3 rooms with a view but two out of the three didn't get such a room at check in. The hotel front desk told us to leave our bags packed and the next day we would be moved to the right class of room. On our return that night we found the bags still sitting in the old room as the planned move hadn't been effected. We were then given three room keys to review them as rooms with a,2,1

The room was nothing like the photos, not enough room to swing a cat in there. Shower changed temperature frequently and TV worked when it wanted to. Service was poor, I enquires about cancelling my room one night in and they did not have any interest into why. I then checked out a day early which was acknowledged but again why I was checking out was of no interest! I would not recommend staying here at all, it wouldn't be so bad if you got what you expected but I cannot stress enough that the room j stayed in was on none of the photos on any website. Considering this place is part of a chain is a joke and I would never step foot in",1,1

The bathroom was dingy – in need of an urgent refurbish and a good clean.   The tiles had been painted over and the paint, together with the paint on the door was peeling.   The website and brochure boasted an in-room coffee maker – this was not in the room on our arrival – it had to be requested from reception.    Our room was not serviced until well into the afternoon – very inconvenient when you have been shopping all day.  We have stayed in New York on a number of occasions at various hotels – all of which were superior to the Wyndham New Yorker.    The only plus is the hotel’s location.",2,1
"Book thru Expedia 4* Mystery Hotel Offer recently for 2 rooms for 3 nights for New York, expecting nothing less of a proper 4* accommodation and allocated this terrible cubicle Hotel called; The Wyndham New Yorker.  The hotel allocated is way below whats been advertised! The rooms are 80ft2, bathroom at 30ft2, closet 6ft2 and you squeeze around like idiots! There are no coffee/tea making facility or fridge in the room, and even if they do put them in, there is not enough space for them. At $155 + Charges + Taxes per night, costing us around USD1100 (3 nights). Terrible experience and something that we have not experience for a long time. Expedia mystery hotel booking and listing of 4* hotels is a shame! The Wyndham New Yorker is way below as advertised (4*) and I feel cheated",1,1
"Really good Manhattan location, literally a 5/7 minute walk to Times Square so a good base for anyone to stay when in NYC but the rooms are shockingly bad!  They are so small and claustrophobic and not even clean, the carpet was disgusting!  The bathroom was as big as a wardrobe and that is no exaggeration!  Even the shower was horrible, not clean!  The view from the hotel room was a concrete wall, so no view!  This hotel needs a serious upgrade to this century!  The value for money on this was shocking but I guess all NYC hotels are expensive!  I stayed at the Westin which is a couple of blocks closer to Times Sq after staying here and omg what a difference it was, I would never stay here again or recommend it to anyone!",2,1

"This is an old hotel, little bit out-dated but with reasonable but small chambers. Beds were OK, bathrooms out fashion but clean. Service of staff is low. WiFi is limited and requires submitting an e-mail adresss for each device. Each time you enter the hotel you have to show your room key (feeling like a criminal while paying considarable room fees). Luggage storage after check out is charged with $ 2 per item (what about guest service as is usual in most hotels ??). Concierge does not arrange a taxi for transfer to the airport (only willing to call expensive private car service).",1,1
"I am really not happy with this hotel. We've just had our 4th night (out of 7) and we're just finding more negative points. Not happy about the bathroom, very small and dirty - hairs everywhere, rooms are very noisy and don't find the majority of staff to be helpful at all. I read all the negative reviews but decided to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt because it was good value, but really disappointed so far. The diner is also really overpriced. I wouldn't stay here again.",2,1
"Noise, small rooms (yes, even for NYC) and tiny bathrooms make this a 2 star room at best.  I can only assume that due to the reasonable rates this hotel attracts unseasoned travelers because no others would rate this star more than 3 at most.  We stayed with a group attending the New York Now show and not one of us our of three rooms could come up with any positives for our rooms. There was not room for more than one person per room to walk, this includes the metro queen double and the metro queen rooms. The bathrooms were very small and out dated with what seemed like original features.

"The location is close to Times Square however it is also close to the main bus depot, Penn subway and Madison station which makes it a very busy part of the city with a lot of homeless people begging. Regarding the hotel there is scaffolding outside with loud and vibrateing drilling going on from 10am until 5pm so no sleep during the day.  At night the rooms are so close and and the walls so thin you can hear the people in the rooms next to you on both sides use the bathrooms . The plumbing is very noisy.  I was unfortunate to be beside airline staff who banged doors and shouted until 4.30 am for the whole 5 nights I stayed there.  The rooms are small with no tea and coffe making facilities. There is a small coffee kiosk in the lobby which closes at 6pm. The Concierge staff were",2,1
"I stayed here with my sister, her now husband and my partner for 1 week. The rooms are typically small, couldn't expect any more in such a central location. But the location was the only good thing about this hotel in my opinion. My sister and her husband were eloping and getting married in Central Park. It wasn't a huge affair but my partner tried to get the bellboys to order a car for us to bring us and they said they'd get us one when we came down to the lobby. When we arrived down (in a big wedding dress) I asked someone to call us a car they said they couldn't and didn't even give us an excuse as to why not. Just shrugged at us. We were inevitaby late as most brides are so we just went outside and had to hail a cab ourselves.  I felt this was very bad customer service. A",2,1
"This hotel desperately needs updating.  I'm sure it's expensive to do, but the Wyndham should not put its name on this old monstrosity.  Location is great -- 1/2 block from Penn Station.  The lobby is still lovely.  Receptionist was very friendly.  Then we got on the elevator....  It went up to the 21st floor, stopped, but the door wouldn't open.  This is a full elevator in mid-July, and the heat was unbearable.  Finally someone hit ""1""  and we went back down to the lobby.  Elevator doors still wouldn't open.  After going back up and down another round, the doors opened.  We all ran out the door.  The room was small but adequate.  The bathroom is in dire need of an update.  The air vent over the bed leaked, but fortunately only onto the floor.  Mildew smell soon to follow!  We",2,1
"We booked through Booking.com and initially thought that the price was reasonable but then you add the following  New York Sales Tax at 8.875%,  New York City Hotel Tax at 5.875% Occupancy Tax of $2.00 per day,  oh and I almost forgot a $27 charge per day for amenities, this amounted to an additional cost per room per night of $78. not to be sneezed at!!!!  We were initially put into a room on the 26th floor and boy you could not even swing a cat  it was so small, and we were paying $346 a night(last minute change to booking) luckily we had an issue with the room safe and I asked to get another room, within 5 minutes we were moved to the 28th floor and the room was almost twice the size of the initial room that we were given. WHY IS THIS I ASK????  Then on the second day when we",2,1
"This was the last stop of our honeymoon and we were really disappointed. The staff were particularly miserable on arrival and immediately hit us with a $75 early check in fee. The room was the size of a postage stamp despite being a 'queen' room, and in desperate need of a refurb. The banging outside and inside in the morning was also annoying. Saving grace was the good location but wouldn't stay there again. Better options available for the price.",2,1
Sink didn't drain  Shower had poor water pressure and was like warm at best Disappointing stay,1,1
"Overall the hotel was OK, However the room was less than fine. I was staying for 4 nights and the wardrobe was so so small that nothing would fit in. Couple that with the bathroom that a child would have difficulty fitting in, that sums up the stay.",2,1
"The trip was disappointing.   The Hotel was clean, but the rooms are very old and dingy.   The bathroom was dated and the tiles had paint / chipping that looked bad.   The carpet looked like it needed to be replaced.   The rooms really need an update.",2,1
"I've stayed here often, and hoped that when Wyndham took over it would mean good things. Mostly nothing has really changed except that now you are hit with a mandatory resort charge when you show up. What do you get for that=crappy internet, and nothing more. So, if you want to spend $25-$30 per night more than you had planned, go for a better place. We checked out after the first night and did just that.",2,1
"Firstly, some good things about the hotel..  > Easy access to The TicToc diner (which is part of the hotel but is a separate company)  > Its location - next door to Penn Station, Madison Square Gardens and very close to Macy’s and the Empire State Building  > The staff - they were mostly helpful and the cleaning ladies were friendly and did a fine job each day   And now for the bad  The Rooms  Paid extra for a room with view of the Hudson or the Empire State Building and if I twisted my neck to a 95 degree angle with my face pressed against the windows than yes I could just about see the Hudson. Furthermore, the bed was positioned in front of the window which meant you spent your room time looking at a plain old tired wall rather than the NYC skyline.  The room itself was",1,1
"I usually don't do reviews. But I couldn't resist myself this time around. Checked in to this hotel for almost a week. For 3 out of 7 days, there was drilling activity going outside my room. That too in the morning !! I went can complained every single day. Finally on the third day I also noticed that there was someone right outside my window. So not only was my head bursting, now I had no privacy. Personally i have no issues if the hotel wants to do maintenance work, but why would you put your customers right next to the construction location when you know there is going to be noise ? Is that good customer service ?",1,1

I booked a double room in Wyndham from 21-Jul-15 to 23-Jul-15 via Otel.com and the confirmation number i received is (Conf#25232519). Before my visit to New York, i called this hotel and confirmed that it is going to be a double room. But when I went to check-in, they said they will give single room only. They suggested to take a roll over bed and charged for that too inspite of not allocating double room.  My advice to people who is looking for Wyndham is, not to book via Otel.com type of sites, but directly with Wyndham. I am disappointed with the way these agents and the hotel allocated my room.",2,1
"Stayed for 2 nights here in this hotel over the Christmas. It is definitely not a 4 star hotel with the level of service and facilities! Rooms are extremely dirty, staff not helpful at all and there is no customer service! However, the location is great and the main reasons I booked it.",2,1
"In typical New York fashion, this is one of those hotels that the property owners can only do so much with what they have.  Every person I interacted with during my four night stay was attentive and friendly, and the Lobby is very impressive, but once you get past that velvet rope and up the elevators the story starts to change.  The hallways are dark and dingy.  The red carpeting  is faded and the hallway lighting is dim enough to remind me of The Shining.    Once in my room I was frustrated to find that there was only 1 electrical outlet available, and that it was incorporated with the desklamp.  For me to use it, I needed to move the nightstand out from the wall and then move the lamp to the nightstand - because, you know, that's easy... But, there were two electrical outlets",2,1

"Well where do you begin, had a lovely holiday on the QM 2 cruise line we then had the mis fortune of staying at this horrible hotel. The staff are rude we waited nearly 3 hours for our room only to be put in a room the size of a shoe box. When we phoned down the manager was rude and did not care. Please only stay at this hotel as a last resort and I mean last resort",1,1
"The New Yorker on Eighth Avenue in the thirties was built around 1930, contemporary with the Empire State Building which in scale it resembles, filling the better part of a city block. Nicola Tesla lived in rooms there for a span of years. Wyndham's has taken over the place and work seems to be underway on refurbishment at least on the exterior. It is a vast-feeling place with an enormous lobby that makes a very grand impression on arriving guests. The coffee shop just off this lobby is a New York classic with Art Deco furnishings. My wife and I stayed there one night on a stop over and for that purpose our room was adequate. But travelers used to the comfort and amenities of more recently-built hotels may find rooms of the type we had disappointing. Ours was as small a one as",2,1
Possible bed bug infestation and mold BEWARE (see photos):  After being bitten in the middle of the night while laying on the mattress (which left several bites on my thigh) I frantically decided to pull back the mattress cover and try to figure out what bit me. I've never had this happen so I googled bed bugs and its symptoms. I pulled back the fitted sheet and observed old urine stains on the mattress pad cover which I also found disgusting. I then unzipped the mattress cover to see if there were residue from past bedbugs and observed tiny black residue throughout the mattress similar to black pepper grains. I also observed mold residue on the headboard. I called the front desk to report this at approximately 3 a.m after almost 2 hours of receiving the run around and very,1,1
"We have stayed at a Wyndham Hotels in other American cities and felt they were great value with good service - can't say the same for the New Yorker. Although we know to expect smaller than average rooms in a New York hotel - this space was tight, barely room for one to turn around in the bathroom. Also had the surliest front desk staff we've ever experienced. In addition they add a mandatory $25/day charge for ""facility fees "" - that means internet - we haven't even stayed in a hotel in the last 5 years that still charges for internet, let alone $25/day. There's lots of hotels in great locations and in this price range in New York - definitely would not recommend this one.",2,1
"We were impressed by the lobby but when we went to our room it was very small for three of us and our luggage. That is two double beds in what I might say would be a one double bed room. We had to jump around three open suitcases all the time (not forgetting we had travelled from NZ for a 8 night stay here -just over three weeks altogether in US) I must agree with other travellers it is very convenient in the heart of the city so close to a lot of amenities and attractions. We walked most of the area close by down to Times Square, Rockefeller Centre etc also a grocery store just across the road. New York was magic and exciting but very crowded and dirty with trash everywhere and the streets and pavement broken up. Fine by us thou, I'm just saying, and not surprising with the",1,1
"It was our belated honeymoon, we stayed in the hotel for !2 weeks! Check in was okay. They have said they will give us a nice room.  To me it was not nice at all, the room was very small, the carpet very dirty. They did not have slippers, when I asked at the reception, they did not even looked at me to answer. So I had to buy slippers. After that I did not even try to communicate with them. I think it is their job to take care of the guests not a favor, but this is how it felt. We were thankfully not all the day in the room so we basically used it to sleep and shower. By the way the walls are so thin that I could hear the guests in the room next to us taking a shower. SO the management should really consider to train the front office team to be more professional and show them",2,1
We stayed here for 5 nights. When we arrived the room we were booked into had wallpaper peeling of the wall and the grout in the bathroom was black.  Reception seemed surprised that this was an issue! ! So after 2 hours we had a new room - it seems most of the rooms are tired and not well maintained. Staff were rude and unhelpful. We had family staying at the Stalybridge and fairfield and it was much better. The shower was pathetic aswell. Do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else.,1,1
"This hotel is on 34th St., within walking distance of the Empire State Building. The rooms are puny, two people need to plan how to navigate around the bed without bumping on each other. The bathrooms are in serious need of updating and upgrading, they are from the 50s!! The AC jas seen better times, also in need of upgrading.  When I checked out I made sure we had no additional charges. Although the hotel told me there were none, I was charged for two movies at $25 each, directly to my credit card. Double check!  Staff at reception desk are arrogant and borderline rude.",2,1
"A friend and I checked into this hotel today and were greeted somewhat coldly by the guest agent at the check in desk (they get one star for letting us check in two hours early --- I will say that). After proceeding to our room, we were astonished to find that the room looked very different than the regular guest rooms that were pictured on the HotelTonight app where we booked this room. Understanding that this is New York, and hotel rooms are small to begin with, we decided to make it work. It was only for one night, after all.  Before heading out to our dinner reservation, we decided to take a quick rest and pulled back the covers -- only to find what looked like a man's hair on the sheets (neither myself nor my friend are male). I called the front desk immediately and the",2,1
"My wife and I stayed for a weekend in June. The hotel staff gave us room 3810, and told us it was the biggest room in the hotel. It was a large suite, except that the bedroom was right next to the employee elevators, and the elevators were extremely loud all night, it was like a bowling ball dropping all night. The next night we slept on the sofa bed, which was very uncomfortable. We had two bathrooms, both of them were not very clean. There were also flies coming into the rooms from the balcony.",2,1
"We stayed at the New Yorker for the 4th time over Christmas 2014. Our first stay in '09 was superb with a stunning view of the ESB and a good sized room. However when we came back this Christmas we found that it had been taken over by Wyndham. The old bar 'Coopers Tavern"" was gone. It was a cosy little place that was great to come back to after being out all day. Now it has been replaced by a monstrosity called TRATTORIA BIANCA. It is ultra bright with uncomfortable bar stools and generally has the feel of a diner rather than a bar. Also gone is the little souvenir shop downstairs. Always handy to pick up last minute gifts and little toiletries. The change in decor is a modern take on art deco and far too brash. The final straw for us has been the change to the Tick Tock diner.",2,1
"After waiting in an endless line to check in, I was informed of a ""resort fee"" that I did not authorize when I prepaid my reservation. I reached out to the hotel directly with a screenshot of my prepaid reservation that included fees and they basically told me it didn't matter because they were going to charge me anyway.  The room itself was tiny-which I expect for NYC. What I didn't expect was for it to be disgusting. I have a hard time believing there is a cleaning staff. I sent a picture of our bathroom to the hotel directly and they claimed it was ""chipped paint"" not dirt... yeah right. The bathroom was straight up disgusting. Unfortunately, we didn't use the shower until the morning, otherwise i would have demanded a new room. As soon as i saw it i felt sick that i had even",1,1
"I reserved a premium suite with a view of the Empire State Building or the Hudson River above the 38th Floor. When I arrived I was told that no such room was available. The hotel staff charged me the same price and refused to give me any money back. When I made my reservation online the website said it still had three premium suites left. Obviously the hotel staff lied to me and was most likely saving the rooms for some gold rewards customer. The room they gave me had no view, it was on the 26th floor and a smaller suite. What is the point of making a reservation if the hotel staff will not honor it and still charge you full price.",2,1
Small is right. The New Yorker is famous for sure and the location is perfect but from the minute you step inside the rotating doors your disappointment begins. From the rude guest services and I promise I was nice as can be to the lack of recognition of who you are. We were there for a week and they kept asking to see our card to go up the elevator even thou we knew their names. It was just oh so underwhelming. I had purchased an upgraded room on Expedia which promised a view of the Empire State Building and a larger interior. Well we could barely fit in the door as this room somehow managed to squeeze a queen size bed into it and the only view we had was the building next to us. The air conditioner broke and they didn't even offer to move us to a better room. The water had,2,1
We must have been staying in a different hotel to others reviewing it. Our accommodation voucher quoted room with queen size bed. Our first room was so small you could just about get a double bed in. Second room was marginally bigger but still only a double bed. Our third room was much the same size as the second but a different layout had to lay suitcases in entrance/exit as there was no space anywhere else. There were no tea/coffee making facilities in any of the rooms and they all very tired. The location was fine but we honestly could not recommend this hotel.,1,1
"The touted renovation occurred around about a decade ago,mor or less.  This is not a four star hotel.  The bed and pillows smelled of head grease and old sweat.  Everything scaled way back to save expense.  Terrible resentful service.  Okay at 150 a night but NOT for 295!",2,1
"Stayed here for a week in June. Location is great but the only fault I had with the hotel was that On check in $180 was taken from my partners visa debit card, We were never informed that the card was being debited just told they needed to keep a card on file incase of damages etc. We noticed after a couple of days the money was missing from the account so We rang front desk and they said it would be put back in 3-5 working days after check out we are now home 15 days and still no sign of the money even though we have called the hotel numerous times to try and get the money back onto our account they keep saying they will get back to us. They have been no help what so ever in trying to rectify the situation and never again will be returning to stay in the New Yorker.",2,1
"The excellent location is the best feature of this hotel. The hotel is worn out: it needs massive renovation. Old furniture, old mattress, old carpet, old bathroom old style. Shabby towels and sheets. The shower either burned or frozen our backs, ten times during each usage. There was only one electrical outlet in the room: we had mobile phones, computer, iPad, camera battery charger, walk-talkie charger. Can you guess how desperate we were? I would never come back until I hear/read that this old hotel has been fully renovated. I do not recommend this hotel before the renovation.",2,1
"Ok, the good bits. Location is quite good, especially for the Highline Walk, Times Square and underground connections. Breakfast was not included in our rate (even  at around £200 p/n) so best to go outside. We got there at 3pm, after waiting in the check-in queue we were told to come back 20 minutes later, not impressed. The check-in lady was quite rude and offhand. We took our own bags to our room, which was not too bad, and it had an in-room safe. The second morning we complained that the shower was not hot, whilst we were out someone had come into the room and fixed it - we thought. The next morning the water was even colder. They sent a maintenance mad up who adjusted the temp and it was fine after this. Check-out was even more shambolic. Long queues, and to cap it all they",2,1
"I was expecting more from a Wyndhan property. The room was old and dirty. The shower had long black hairs all over the wall when we checked in. I called the front desk and they sent housekeeping to clean it. We left and returned to the room and the hairs were still there. Shelves in the bathroom had layers of dust on them and there was mold between the shower tiles. The hotel staff were friendly but the hotel lacked service features that most hotels have. For instance, if you need to store your bags for an hour after checking out, there is a fee for that.",2,1
"This hotel is so run down it smells rancid.  I would not recommend to anyone.  The only plus is you can walk to the Javitz Center or Penn State. The corridors need to have the carpet removed and disinfected. It was such a disappointment, the pictures on the website are  deceiving, my room was the size of a walk-in closet..",1,1
"Ok, so it's historic.  Nice, right?  No.  The rooms are MICROSCOPIC.  There was a hair in my tub and on my blanket.  There is no where to put your toiletries since there is no shelf in the bathroom.  Just a sink, a tub (which badly needs caulking on the tile), and a toilet not unlike one at a gas station bathroom.  The staff have the famous ""NYC bad attitude"" so don't expect to be cared about.  There wasn't one, single, staff member I encountered that was pleasant with me.    No room service.  No ""store"" in the hotel to even get a cheap bottle of wine or maybe a granola bar..lol..   No, I do not recommend at all.",1,1
How dare they add a $24 a night resort fee! This deserves mention since most hotels don't charge this! This hotel is not a resort or anything close to a resort!  Maybe the Mandarin Oriental is or Penninsula is but this definitely is not a resort! Worth a protest at the least!,2,1
Charges 22 $ more extra each night then the price I was promissed and prepaid on Priceline. The hotel keeps on blaming on Priceline and say It is my responsibility to make Priceline give me the correect endprices. Redicilous and extremely unprofesional.,1,1
"A group of 4 of us where travelling to New York to meet up with friends from over there, so booked a suit here so we could all stay together in Times Square as a thank you to them for showing us around.  I went on the reviews of this hotel and the fact that they had great customer service.  We found the complete opposite!  The computer system went down half way through checking in (payment for bill needed settled in advance before a room key was issued, which I can only assume is due to the amount of complaints they receive, so they do not have to give discount).  The room was ok, nothing special considering that we paid almost £400 a night (2 night stay booked), a it dated.  The problems started when they children in the room above us started jumping off beds in the early hours",1,1

We were put in a tiny room with very old dirty carpet, with no mini fridge and that had a scaffolding outside so we couldn't kept the curtains open. The bathroom hasn't been updated since the 50s. The tub was dirty with a rusty spout and the shower head sprayed the water erratically and the water kept going between cold and burning. There was one shampoo and one soap and we had to ask for more. It took the staff a long time to bring it to our room.   The TV was not HD and the pillows were really small. The bed itself was comfortable but only had one blanket. There were no extra things in the room.  The hotel is located next to Penn station. which is good for public transport.

This time, there were 4 of us and I called the reservations desk to inquire about getting adjoining rooms. I was told that every effort would be made to assure us of getting the rooms we asked for. When we checked in, however, we were told that the property did not have adjoining rooms at all. The registration clerk was less than helpful. To make a long story short, we had rooms on the 30th floor which apparently had been renovated and only open the past week. One of the rooms was ok. The other room was tiny and the shower head had no water pressure and basically just spit water. To add insult to",2,1
Having visited NYC a lot of times I understand that rooms are small and all hotels are expensive. But our room was cupboard sized (hardly any room to walk around the bed) and the bathroom was pretty horrible.  The historic hotel is undergoing a refurbishment programme so is scaffolded outside and rooms are being updated. At check-in we requested a room with a view but were told that as we had paid a (relatively!) low rate and booked through expedia they couldn't guarantee a view and had no refurbished rooms at all available with a view. To be fair we chose a view over a refurbished room (34th floor) and it was amazing. But the double glazing had failed in half the window so was misted up and we could only see through half of it.  The bathroom was pretty nasty with badly painted,2,1

Only view was down a void, looking at the rooms on the other side.  Second morning we asked to be moved to a room with a view and we got one with a glimpse of the Hudson River, In addition, the room was so small that our 2 travel cases took up nearly all the floor space and we had difficulty walking around the room.  The cases would not fit in the wardrobe which was so narrow that standard coat hangers (as supplied by the hotel) only fitted at 45 degrees to the wardrobe.General impression given by front desk staff was that they like to keep the better rooms for Wyndham Hotels Loyalty Club members and anyone else is just",2,1

Answers to your questions were curt and incomplete giving a sense of unwillingness even the customary greetings like "" Have a nice day "" were made to sound like a dismissal . We were intimidated not to ask for advice and help from the reception and concierge and instead seek advice from fellow guest or shops outside the hotel .

Let me be specific:  1. At check-in you are informed there is a mandatory $23 per day ""resort"" charge.  I asked where the beach chairs and palm trees were and was rewarded with a laugh.  The charge is for unlimited use of phone and internet.  The fact that I have a smart phone and need neither was not important.  Basically, expect to pay $23 more than the listed rate.  2.

The check in process was a horrible, I waited nearly 20 mins in the queue. After requested for a higher floor room we were assigned room 2335 which the front desk staff mentioned had a very good view?! Room was extreme small compared to other US hotel I stayed before.

I normally stay at the Marriott at Times Square when attending these events, but decided this trip to stay at the New Yorker so I could walk to the Javits Center.

There were variously 4 to 6 people behind the registration desk, and they were checking in only 3 to 4 people at a time. There were perhaps 6 other hotel staff in the lobby who were doing absolutely nothing. It seemed to take an unusually long time to check in each party.

"I stayed at this hotel for a medical conference.    Positives:  The hotel lobby is tastefully decorated.  The room rate is attractively below average cost for a NYC hotel.  This is a very busy hotel.  Many European visitors.   The Tick Tock diner was standard average diner food.  Convenient to the subway, B&H, Macy's, Penn Station, Madison Sq Garden.  Negatives:  The rooms are tiny.  The rooms are amongst the smallest hotel rooms that I have ever stayed at.  The bathroom is very tight.  The decor is old art deco, and does not look like it has been renovated since the art deco period from decades ago.  The shower fixture dripped and I had to close to the bathroom door to sleep.

This is my fourth time in NYC and have stayed at the Plaza, the Waldorf, and a cute little boutique hotel called the Lucerene.

The one bedroom is very tiny. Upon entering the room the bed is located 1 footstep as you enter. The bathroom was outdated with no vents and poor outside view.

The location was superb and made everything easily accessible - the diner (Tick Tock) is brilliant and the quality of the food was very high as was the service, however our room and bathroom was really disappointing.  For the star rating of the hotel i expected better.  The room was tiny and the bathroom started with some black mould that increased with our stay.  Thankfully we were out so much it didn't affect our time there and I daresay we could have asked tohave been moved - but i would have felt uncomfortable doing that.  Not sure if it's being renovated throughout at the moment - we were the 28th floor - but i would really consider staying somewhere else if you are going to NYC",2,1
"The location of the hotel is fantastic as is the lobby. However the joy ends there unfortunately. We travelled as a family of four and the room was disappointing to say the least. When we were booking the break, we asked our travel agent for 1 double and two single beds.  We arrived to find two 'double' beds which were actually more like two 'single-and-a-half' beds.  We informed the reception and was told they couldn't do anything (I'm very surprised a four star hotel this size doesn't have two single beds). The room was old and tired, the shower couldn't make up its mind to be hot or cold and it just wasn't what we expected overall. Transportation to JFK airport in this hotel is a joke. We booked a car in the morning for 5pm to be told ""oh sorry sir, someone forgot to book",2,1
"This hotel had NO amenities in room. The ""diner"" was terrible and it was the only option for in room dining (for which the front desk not the rooms had menus). The wifi went in and out. My sheets had a huge hole in them and the bathroom reminded me more of an institution than a hotel. The walls were  Paperthin. So much so I could hear the guy next to me sneezing.",1,1
"The only compliment I have for this hotel is it's location, which is within walking distance of most things and right next to a subway station.  As far as the hotel itself goes, I've never stayed somewhere worse. With exception of one Front Counter attendant who checked us in, the staff were all incredibly rude and unhelpful. The hotel needs massive renovations, well beyond what has already been done. Our room was tiny and old, even by NYC standards. The walls are paper-thin, meaning lots of sleep lost due to people in the halls and our neighbouring guests in their rooms, plumbing noise and loud airconditioning units. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone; take your money elsewhere!",1,1
"This was our first time in New York, so I'm not an expert, but I would have expected more from a 4* hotel.  It's a very busy hotel in Midtown Manhattan. We didn't have many queries but we found the staff to be unaccomodating when we wanted to use a restroom upon returning to collect our luggage after check-out.   We stayed on the 19th floor. The rooms are pretty basic. Our beds were comfortable and the room was clean. However, one morning we woke up to find brown water coming from the shower, bath and taps, which was completely off putting.  This problem was  resolved by the afternoon.  I'd have liked there to have been some shower gel in the bathroom, but at least there was shampoo, soap and body lotion.  We didn't have a terrible stay at the New Yorker but we wouldn't return",2,1
"If you are in one of the un-renovaTed rooms your going to be utterly dissapointed. Because of the dollar i had to pay the same amount as they charge for a top notch room but recieved a low level one. It barely fits the bed in it. Severly unclean, didnt have hot water until 15 minutes into the shower. Check in attendant was very rude. People running and yelling through the hallways every night we were there. No view of anything but another building 5 metres away. And my sheets were dirty when i arrived. I do not reccomend you take the risk with this hotel like i did for my honeymoon.",1,1
"I booked this hotel months in advance, and the main reason was because it didn't seem to have over inflated prices over the easter weekend. The hotel is in a pretty good location - right next to a subway station, really close to Macy's and the Empire State Building and in walking distance to a lot of attractions such as Times Square, Rockefeller Center etc. We stayed in a ""Classic City View Queen Room"". My first impression of the room was that it was old, small and noticeably only a double bed. I was really disappointed and even a bit angry because I don't think it is acceptable to advertise a room and charge it as a ""Queen"" if it does not feature a Queen bed. We were staying for 6 nights and although the rooms were already obviously overpriced we decided to ask for an upgrade.",1,1
"I only stayed 1 day and it was horrible...the receptionist was rude. They also do not provided enough information for first time customers,  until you actually get there you find out about extra fees. Also, the water in showers is not hot, its lukewarm. However, the location was great walking distance to the concert we were attending.",2,1
No in room coffee facilities at all!  No water in room No fridge  Booked a king bed and got two small doubles for 8 day 2nd honeymoon.  Bathroom was like a closet Staff in the tick tick cafe were angry all the time we tried it a few times.  Italian restaurant was rushed and average italian - expensive for what it was.  We booked months in advance and paid a good rate and feel we were ripped off,2,1
"We stayed there for 4 nights from 26/03/15..they took a preauthorisation off my card for the balance with an extra $45.00 per night, as of yet this amount of £981.00 is still pending on my bank account and has not yet been returned!  Sour end to what was a fantastic stay",2,1
Me and my wife stayed at the Wyndham New Yorker for our honeymoon. The hotel looked lovely from the inside if you ignore the current scaffolding due to renovations. The first room we where given was tiny it had a double bed and a desk with no room for any other furniture we where however upgraded thanks to Rachel the lovely receptionist who helped us out. We really liked the hotel and some of the views are stunning. That however is where the good ends and now we are home i have found £219 of unauthorised debit charges pending on my account from the same time and date we checked in this payment has been sat in limbo and i am being told i would need to wait till the 17th before the bank can get involved. The only time we gave any card details was for security when we checked in we,2,1
"This hotel is not 4 star. It's not even 3 star, the rooms were very small,bathroom small and old, shower not working properly,no coffee machine in the room.  At the front desk not very cooperative. In the whole visit not impressed at all.  Never going to recommend to anybody.",2,1
"The hotel is old, need a make-over and is substandard. I am wondering how the hotel pretends to be a four-star category?!  The room was smaller than a outhouse (~ 70 sqfeet, 6m² ?!). The carpet had wet stinky spots, which made me to change the room (which was not much better). The window was leaky with lots of cold air coming in during night. There was lot of dust. Breakfast was horrible. Thanks god there is a Starbucks next to the hotel.  Would never ever go there again!",1,1
There was a balcony outside the windows of the room with construction scaffolding in place obstructing all views of the city.  Workers were on the balcony during the day forcing me to keep all the shades draw during the day.  I question how the hotel can give someone a room like that.,2,1
Wifi was free when you come in the hôtel And in the end it is 24 dollars à day  And you don t have to say Anithing And leave the hôtel ! Thank you so Much 😡,2,1
"In a great location, is about the best I can say about this hotel. It's kitty corner from Madison Square Garden and walking distance to Times Square and many other notable places. Despite the showy lobby, it is OLD and needs a ton of work.  Some of the rooms have been re-decorated somewhat. The first room I stayed in had 10 inches between the desk and the end of the bed, one useable wall outlet (behind the bedside table. The other two outlets were from an era I am not familiar with). The bathroom shower head sprayed water everywhere but in the stall and went from very hot to chilly every few minutes. The room was so awful, I asked for a different room the next day. The room was roomier but the bathrooms have not had anything done to them in about 40 years. You can see from the",2,1
"This hotel location is good. Room is clean and nice except for certain things need to be cautious when you book. Rate seems cheaper but there is hidden Facilities fee of USD$23+. Luggage storage is $2 per bag regardless of how small. There is no WiFi in lobby. Once check out, you can't use the restroom at lobby. Need card access. Don't be deceived by the Receptionist that they upgrade your room without charge. Actually is your correct selection of booking. the room there is no coffee making and hot water. No toothbrush and slippers. Heater took so long to warm the room. Receptionist forgot to give us WiFi password. We have to go down again and ask from them.",2,1
The room was very small even for NYC standards. The service was poor. I could not get anyone the phone for service so I had to go down to the lobby personally. Hot water was not consistent. Will not stay here again. Great location in Manhatten and very close to the subway.,2,1
"3pm is ridiculous of atime to check in, had to leave my bags at bell and get charged for that after being told I couldn't check in four times after 3 pm. Went to go eat at the tick tock, Sat there after being welcomed by hostess for 15, without getting service, then walked out and waited more to get checked in.stayed next to housekeeping office, door kept on opening and closing throughout. Just my experience.",2,1
"We got this hotel off a Hotwire Hot Rate for $104 for the second part of our trip to New York. The location is the only good thing, it is right next to Times Square and Fifth Avenue. Check in is extremely slow as there is only one check in desk. When we finally got to the check in counter we asked the clerk if we could have a room with two double beds, she said no without even checking checking the computer. We asked her why she didn't have any rooms with double beds beds because rooms with double beds are very  rarely sold out in hotels. She said we were booked in a room with a single beds on Hotwire and that she would find a room with two double beds. I know that there can sometimes be a booking for a single on a Hotwire's deals, but to say that there is booking for one bed",2,1
"Where is the health department when you need them? Is it really OK to breathe in visible mold and mildew, as was prevalent in a wide disgusting strip around the perimeter of our teeeniest bathroom ever (well close). This place should be condemned. OK, it's old and the day to day dirt, well, clean in that regard, but the buildup of scum over time was truly revolting...had to remember not to look down in the bathroom onto the floor. The rest of the bathroom, yes, tiny, with tiles painted over with a hospital green shade; floor grout black and not from a natural color; shower/toilet OK; truly down there in pathetic toiletries; the bath towels were OK, but the hand towels and face towels had that threadbare oily feel that has absorbed way too many washings. The bed and pillows were",1,1
"Stayed one night with my husband. The art deco style of the hotel appealed and location to a convention prompted me to choose the room.  Pros: Old yet seemingly attractive rooms, staff made sure to check room keys of patrons before going upstairs to rooms and inexpensive.  Cons: Room had not been properly cleaned! Used starbucks cup on desk, leftover USED soap in shower and trash still in both trash cans upon arrival. We NICELY told the desk clerk about the conditions of the room upon departure. She only asked why we didn't tell them sooner (NOT THAT WE NEED TO EXPLAIN OURSELVES, but we were exhausted and didn't want to wait a long time for them to correct the mistake). Not one single apology, she just shrugged! So I guess it's our fault we hate having to complain and wait to",2,1
"The lobby and restuarants are good, the exercise facility is excellent, the staff is accomodating. The rooms are however very small, old/dated. Bathroom has no space for personal items and doesn't carry tissues as a standard supplied item in the bathroom. Bed comfort is just fair.",2,1
"I booked my hotel through an on line agency.  Upon arrival I was greeted with a ""Oh, you are one of them"" type attitude.  They did not see my rate, but said, ""Did you get a better rate than X?"" question.  I arrived late and had to get up early in the morning, so I just went to my room.  It was a very cold day in NYC and I was nicely surprised to get a two room suite.  Unfortunately, the room was at 55 degrees when I went in.  I turned up the heat to get it warm.  Needless to say, the bedroom never warmed up and I ended up sleeping on the couch in the other room.  When I informed them of this the next morning, all I got was ""I am sorry to hear that and we will let maintenance know.""  When I asked if there was something that would be done, they looked up my reservation, and told",1,1
"The only positive things to say about this hotel are its location and its friendly staff.  The room was disappointingly small, very little space for our bags, the bathroom was a joke, tired and in need of some upgrade...........very disappointing experience.",2,1
"The rooms were small, and continental breakfast that I paid extra for was a piece of toast and a cup of coffee. The location was nice but the rooms were not very pleasant.",2,1
"Im never one to write a bad review, but I disliked this hotel so much I left a night early. It was incredibly noisy and run down. I'm a light sleeper so if you are as well, don't stay here. Tiny rooms as well. I would highly recommend looking elsewhere.",2,1
"I had a reservation in this hotel for one night on Valentines weekend, when I was close to the hotel having dinner and ready to go to check-in, I decided to call the New Yorker to make sure everything was ok with my reservation, 1st nobody would answer the phone and then when the operator did, she transferred me to the Front Office where a very beyond rude lady told me she couldn’t  find my reservation, when I asked her to please check again to see if perhaps the reservation was made under my married name or even my company’s name ( I was just trying to give her options) the lady from the Front Office told me to understand that there was not reservation for me and she was very busy and hung up the phone on me. For the following 30 minutes I tried again to contact the Front",1,1
"The New Yorker Hotel is actually in quite a good location, near a train station and most key tourist attractions are rather easy to get to from here either by walking or through the rather confusing train network if you have never been to New York. The elevators were quick and efficient as well, which is good considering there are more than 40 floors to this hotel.   That being said, the service provided by the hotel is atrocious. I've stayed in multiple different hotels across the United States on both the east and west side of the states and I can quite comfortably say that this is the worst hotel that I've stayed in. Staff are rude and inefficient, (the only time I've actually received a smile and a greeting was from the lady performing room service on the floor I was staying",1,1
"The rooms are small, the manager is rude, the charge you everytime you need your car and that was never explained. I was over charged on my card by 200.00. The restaurant is terrible and service is is noT acceptable.The location of the hotel is the only great thing. I would not recommend anyone from another state to stay here.",1,1
"Upon arrival we were told our room had been cancelled without notification due to the NBA All Star Game! The woman at the desk, Gabina, was horribly rude, I was honestly shocked she still has a position here. We called Booking.Com who we booked through, because we had been confirmed and charged for the room already and they figured it out for us, but we will not return to this hotel, or another Wyndham property if they're going to employ such miserable people. The hotel has an awful creepy feel like you're in the Hollywood Tower Hotel, and the elevators feel like you're going to the Twilight Zone. Good luck to anyone staying here in the future, and make sure it's not on a night with any NBA events because you're likely to get bumped. We watched Gabina write down  a list of 25",1,1
"Recently stayed at the New Yorker for our second visit, have never been so disappointed with a return visit & will not be returning.  Staff were shockingly rude upon check-in. Our room wasn't ready until 1700 even though we were informed of a 1400 check-in. No apologies & almost made to feel as though we were in the wrong for turning up on time.  Have never felt so unwelcome whilst staying in a hotel & it spoiled our whole visit to New York. Would not recommend this hotel any longer.",2,1
"As part of a group of 3 girls travelling, we were horrified to discover how tiny our room was. You literally could not move. The bathroom was ridiculous also. The staff upon check in were bordering on rude. I found the same to be true when I had any queries. They just didn't want to be there. Noise was also an issue as the walls were like paper. We also could have used some coffee making facilities.",2,1
"The Wyndham New Yorker carries an echo of old grandeur, the lobby is still attractive, but the rooms, amenities and the service - sorry, not great at all. And the breakfast at the adjacent trattoria restaurant was really so disappointing. The MD even admitted that they have a very limited menu for the morning, and there was no buffet, so basically – you get what they may have.   The location of the hotel, literally 2 minutes from Penn Station, is great, and if they would upgrade the hotel, the service and the amenities, it would be a fantastic location. As it stands now, I will never come back.",2,1
"We have stayed here at least twice a year for the last 4 years, and our current stay is nothing short of terrible. Our room is MAYBE 10'x14'. I've seen larger bathrooms in other hotels. The staff doesn't seem to care about the guests anymore- we have been waiting over 4 hours just to have a coffee maker brought to the room, which we were told at check in was supposed to be in our room already. If this is how Wyndham management plans to run this hotel, this stay will be our last. There are plenty if other hotels with just as great a location. This place just isn't worth it anymore.",2,1
"My parking experience at this hotel cost a fortune and because of the poorly trained staff caused me to waste hours of time trying to locate my car, I will not return to this Hotel, the staff sent me with my luggage and 5 children walking in the cold rain to a non existent parking lot 5 blocks from the Hotel where they had supposedly valet parked my car--  Stayed January 2015",1,1
"I stayed with my family of 5 and had two rooms and we were very cramped!! The rooms on their website are stretched to look bigger. Just look at the pictures of the TV and you will see the odd shaped TVs. We got a great deal on Priceline and got a very reasonable price.  They have it as a 4 star hotel and their is no way this is 4 stars. More like 3 stars max!! The staff is very nice and the hotel is clean. Just don't plan on anything but a bed and small room. The walls have been painted over and over again, so much so that the bathroom door did not shut. Great location and close to everything. We had a rental car and paid nearly $50 a day for parking. I would not stay here again. There has to be better out their.",2,1
"Nice looking hotels.  The rooms are small, but OK.  Unfortunately the windows (at least on 2oth floor) are not sealed. DO NOT STAY at this hotel between November and March! Otherwise everything was OK.  Good location, convenient to restaurants.  Good breakfast at the Tick-Tock.",2,1
"On the coldest night of the year so far, the heat in the room was not working. I had to switch rooms in the middle of the night to a room that was a ""little"" warmer. The room type was not the same one I reserved and the one I switched to was even a lower room type. The bathroom was so cold I couldn't take a shower. Hotel is outdated and not kept up well. Only thing going for the hotel is its location.",1,1
"we just arrived at the hotel this afternoon January 8th for two nights. There is only valet parking at $48 a day. The room is extremely small, 2 double beds in a room that literally should only have 1 king bed. There's no comfortable sitting chair, and a small desk table. If someone is sitting at the desk you can't get to the other bed. The bathroom is extremely disappointing as it has an old pedestal sink and instead of a counter it has a glass shelf above the sink. The bathtub /shower is so old that there are two faucets to control the tub and two faucets above them to control the shower. I was at least expecting a room that was bigger than a closet.the best thing is that there is free basic Internet surface. Based on my experience right now spend money and stay somewhere else",2,1
"Just booked my room through a 3rd party for April... and when I had called back to request a room on the 7th or 8th floor... they tried to charge me extra for the change. It seems that a lot of the other customers were able to request a room on the 7th or 8th floor without any problems.... but I guess if you call in, they WILL try to charge you extra.   The customer service representative was rude and quite intimidating about any changes to be made. I'm very worried about our stay this upcoming April. It seems all the other rooms on the other floors are quite poor compared to these renovated rooms... I hope I am proven wrong.",2,1
"As soon as you walk into the hotel the huge and elegant lobby will amaze you! After that everything will go downhill. We were assigned a room on the 21st floor and it was worse than a motel. It was a very small queen size room with a small size TV and the bathroom was just horrible, the toilet seat was so small that an average size person like myself could barely sit on it. Forget about stepping into the shower. The bathroom was just gross and old. I tried it and just couldn't take it anymore. At this point we decided to call the front desk and luckily we found a very nice lady at the reception who moved us to a different room on the 7th floor. Hotel has 40 floors and we learned that only the rooms on the 7th and the 8th floor are newly renovated!   So we gathered our stuff and",2,1
The room size (rediculously tiny) is expected because it's New York City. I'm a blonde and upon arrival I immediately noticed long black hairs in the bed. All over the bathroom towels. And stuck to the bathroom shower as well as the bathroom walls.  The women who checked me out of my stay the next morning was a an absolutely terrible human being. So rude and was a completely jerk. Stay anywhere else. We woke up at 2am due to the insanely uncomfortable beds leaving us with aching shoulders and necks.,1,1
"Even using priceline, this hotel cost $300 a night plus another $50 in taxes. Stay away.    Our misadventure began at the front desk.  Despite being able to check in at 3:00, our room was ""not ready"" when we checked in at 8:30 pm.  We sat at the front desk with the clerk telling us that we needed to wait a few more minutes.  After 15 minutes with him, he went ahead and assigned us a room, claiming that it would have been $100 a night more if we had booked it.  While apologizing for the delay, he acted as if he had done us a huge favor by actually giving us a room.   As for the room, it was fairly good sized, but with two full beds.   It was a new floor, meaning it had a ""euro"" look to it. The first problem was that the beds were designed for people of Hobbit height.  I have",1,1
"Don't book this hotel, we thought we got a good deal on a 4 star which offered 2 double beds but it is not even worth that rating and cost.  We first got given a double room on level 27, meant to be river view but could not see anything. Long story short, they somehow managed to double book us twice, first time we all went to reception and escalated to a manager, who was not very helpful or apologetic. They said it would be fixed... gave us new keys after we've been out for the day, I then walked into a lady in her bra watching TV, who had just checked in 10 minutes ago. Imagine!! That was apparently a computer glitch. After some more heated conversations from everyone involved, they gave us a suite on level 24 with good view and discounted some nights. The suite is ok, but",2,1
"Extremely disappointed in stay. Arrived for early check-in and were told that our room would be ready in ""a couple of hours"" and the front desk would give me a call on my cell when it was available. Never received a call that our room was available. Front desk did not even ask if I was a Wyndham Rewards Member (which I am). Rushed transaction.  Room extremely small and a little rough. I paid extra for a CLASSIC CITY VIEW QUEEN ROOM that ""offered stunning NYC views of the Empire State Building or the Hudson River"". Got a view of a building right across the street and scaffolding. No city or river view at all. Disappointing because this was my first trip to New York City. Stayed in room 3116 and based on the map behind the door, it looked like the smallest room on the floor. Tiles",1,1
"Rooms were not as described by reservationist.  Employees were, with a few exceptions, not happy and didn't seem to like people.  No hot water in one of our rooms. Requested a blanket several times, was assured that one would be rushed to us upon the third request, no blanket ever arrived.  Extremely small rooms.  Great location but would not stay here again.",1,1
"Choosed this hotel based on the scores at tripadvisor. In all my bookings so far it has been a sucess. This time it was a miss. This Hotel is overpriced and the rooms really needs renovation. My family of 5 got room at the 23rd floor. This part of the hotel has not been renovated for ages. The rooms are large, but far from nice. The beds are supposed to be double, but you need to spoon to be able to sleep two persons in them. The bathroom is very small and gives you the impression of going back to the 50ies. No breakfast is offerd at the hotel. No coffe or water boiler in the room. Best thing about the hotel is the location, but stay away and choose another in the area.",2,1
checked in 3 days ago & wished we'd stayed somewhere else. not sure why anyone would give this place a good rating. staff get annoyed when you ask questions. rollaway bed wasn't in our room even though we'd paid for it.  had to ring front desk.  never asnwered the phone. had to go down to lobby.  staff rude & not interested in helping you.  i will never stay here again,2,1
Stood in line at reception this afternoon and watched this poor Australian family check in only to be told that the hotel had overbooked their rooms and couldn't give them the rooms they booked.  I wanted to cry seeing how they were treated by reception staff.   We had a simliar experience.  Mediocre hotel with terrible service and staff don't care.  They treat you like a number.  Rooms are very small and the hotel is so big there are not enough staff to deal with the volume.   I tried ringing the front desk at least 10 times but no ever answers the phone.  Stay away from this hotel.  Stay somewhere else where they care about hotel guests and care about your needs.,1,1
I recently stayed here with my family for a short trip to new York.  The hotel is a beautiful old building that is in desperate need of an update.  The staff was friendly and generally helpful but we encountered long lines at the front desk and delays checking into the room.  The keys to the room didn't work so back down to the lobby to get in line again.  They had to re-program the door locks to eventually make them work.  The building itself is old and worn around the edges.  Rooms are very small and dated and the bathrooms have not been updated for decades.  Activities in the adjacent bathrooms comes through the walls loud and clear. I cannot understand how this hotel receives an overall rating of 4.  Needs a renovation.,2,1
"This has to be the worst hotel in NYC, I stayed at many hotels in NYC but this hotel isn't even worth a penny. The hotel is outdated!, if you like a modern clean space than this isn't the one. Please be advised that the rooms look great in pictures but it is so small in person, the bathroom is super dirty and outdated. The paint in the bathroom was peeling and it just smelled so weird. The hallway of the hotel looked like a hospital!  Me and my friend literally checked in, saw our room and within ten minutes we found another hotel (Club Quarters World Trade Center) and checked out asap! I don't understand why this hotel is so expensive, the area is super busy and not the cleanest. Don't waste your money here, go find something better.",1,1
"Stayed recently. Very disappointed with  the experience. Poor value, shabby poor room decor and tiny room. No help with baggage no facilities and no facilities for coffee making etc. Not 4 star at all 2 at most very basic. Will not return.",1,1
"Arrived at the hotel at 3pm (thanksgiving weekend)...and understandably it was busy. We were 3 and were booked a queen bed only. They could not upgrade us. When we went up to the room, their supposed queen bed is the size of a double! But we were told when called reception, that that is a Queen in New York. Finally they stated they could change us rooms to a room that could at least accomadate a rollaway. They said it was not ready, and by the time we got back from our tourist visit around nyc, that we would have the new room. We got back to the hotel at 10pm....and when they gave us the cards to the ""new"" room, we went upstairs, and it was exactly the same room! Finally the manager agreed to put in a rollaway....but it took 2 hours....yes we did not get the bed until",2,1
"On arrival we should of gone by our first impression, GRIM, we struggled in with our luggage my wife and I are both in our sixties there was no assistance offered or given the receptionists were to the point of being very curt and rude we had the card keys thrown across the counter and when asked for directions to the room we were ignored, on entering the very small room there was no tea/coffee making equipment as promised when we emailed when we booked, I went to reception to request it and when I pointed out that we had requested it I was told I was a liar !  when the tea coffee equipment came to the room with two paper cups and two coffee and two tea pods this was all we could have for our entire stay, I asked the room service if we could have two clean cups as the cleaners",1,1
"I travel quite a bit and have stayed in various mid to high-end hotels hundreds of times.  I have left items of value behind 3x and they have never, ever been located by the hotel.  I understand it's my responsibility to make sure I leave with all of my items, but mistakes happen.  On a recent trip to New York, I made a purchase from a high end store and the gift inside the shopping bag was wrapped beautifully - this shopping bag and package could never be mistaken for trash.  Yet when I called the hotel the evening after checking out, the bag doesn't exist.  I consider this stealing.  Shame on you Wyndham New Yorker.  Your policies allow your staff to steal Christmas presents from your guests.  I will not ever be back.",1,1
"For the price we paid I was not at all impressed with the room we received at the New Yorker Hotel.  The room itself was TINY, just enough room for the 2 double beds.  The bathroom looked like it has not been renovated in 30+ years.  Service was also lacking, I understand this is a large hotel, but we had to try the front desk 6-7 times before we finally got someone on the line to assist in getting our car from the valet. The location is great for getting to all the major sites,  but I would not return to this hotel nor recommend with all the other choices available.",2,1
We arrived on Thanksgiving. Stayed 5 nights. Booked thru Hotels.com. We had compromised on quality but hoped for the best given Trip Advisor reviews and personal recommendation. However the hotel is in need of investment. Since booking in Feb 2014 it has entered the Wyndham group of managed hotels. Time will tell. there were demos outside the hotel complaining about owners being like bed bugs and sucking wealth out of the place which doesnt bode well for its future. I had booked a suite for ourselves and a deluxe room for my daughters. The suite being room 3420 was old and disgusting to say the least. We were forced to complain. The reception staff whilst ultimately cooperating did not want to relocate us. In the end despite paying for a suite we had room 831 which was not a,2,1
"Lobby is great, really beautiful. But rooms are very poor. Bed linens are good, house keeping is good, but bathroons are horrible, shower is the worse, water is poor and very uninstable, keeps varying between very cold water to very hot water, never a good temperature. Storage dept are not able to track you package shipped to hotel. And wi-fi does not work at IPhone5 for some reason, none of the 8 days. None. All this is very sad because building is such icon in the city",1,1
"Checked in Thanksgiving Day about 3PM. We were there to celebrate my birthday for the weekend. Unpacked in our little room. Had to close the door to use the toilet. Only had a bed, desk, chair, and dresser and tv. Hardly any room to walk on the far side of the bed. Had to turn sideways. After unpacking we went downstairs to have Thanksgiving Dinner at Trattoria Bianca. Had reservations for 5PM but we were starving. Walked into the restaurant and the young lady across the restaurant at the podium or desk or whatever it was didn't look very friendly. She looked unhappy the whole time we were there. I'm just glad that the waitstaff didn't act like she did. The waitstaff was very nice. After dinner went to Macy's but decided we didn't want to stand in line & wait for Macy's to open",2,1
"The rooms are tiny. The Beds are awful. I would rate it a 1 star hotel. The only thing going for it is the location. When we checked in, there was 1 rooms ready, so we checked in. When we got up to the room, it was so small that we could touch each side wall from the bed. The bed was caved in in the middle. We decided to wait for another room. It was slightly larger, but a dump. We had no choice but to stay the 1st night. We checked out the next morning.",1,1
"Our family stayed at the New Yorker this year; we are volunteers in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and the New Yorker was the headquarters for parade morning.  Very handy to be right there.  The hotel has been steadily improving in the last couple years, and we had a New Yorker Suite with two double beds and a separate living room with a pull-out couch.   Rather small room, but certainly serviceable (and affordable).  Very new, very modern and comfortable.  My only complaint is with the shower - it is badly designed (and I fear they've now used the same design in all their remodeled rooms).  The shower floor slopes AWAY from the floor drain, meaning that it always stays wet, with about 1/2"" of water.  But the worst part is the shower door:  it is mounted above a 4"" ledge",1,1
"We checked in the night before Thanksgiving. The room was so small. The bathroom could only fit one person at a time. The sink was pedestal without any counter space for make-up, toothbrush, etc. We stayed one night and moved to the Carlton Autograph Collection on Madison Ave. The staff was very nice and the characters from the Macy's parade came in the hotel after the parade to change and get some hot coffee. It was fun to see them, but I would never stay there again.",1,1
"Our room was ""new/redecorated"".  It was the size of a postage stamp and had what was called a ""Queen"" sized bed. My wife and I have a wonderful sense of humor, but this experience pushed us to the outer limits ... We stayed two nights and it cost over $700 dollars including parking our car at the rate of $48/day.  They would not let us come and go in our car, we had to leave it in valet until we checked out. We travel the United States extensively and this was one of the most unpleasant experiences to date.",2,1
"I returned to New York for my 30th birthday and was really disappointed with this hotel. I was expecting so much more as generally the reviews are positive.  Firstly, the standard rooms are small even by NYC standards. We had to request to be moved- which in fairness to the hotel, they sorted out quickly and the room we were moved to was much better (the lady on reception who sorted this out was great). But I still found the room we had been allocated to begin with frustrating considering the hotel is not cheap - you shouldn't have to complain in order to get a half decent room!  The hotel is generally quite tired and in need of renovations. Also because of it's size and the huge number of guests, it felt very busy all the time, and very impersonal. Be prepared to wait a while",2,1
"I knew going on that this is a terrible location for a hotel. Penn Station is ugly, crowded and annoying. But it's convenient for work so I sucked it up. But I'll never do that again.  I had one request, a room far from the elevators as the dinging tends to keep my up at night, as a light sleeper. I reminded the clerk at registration of this. And with a smile, she placed me directly facing the elevator. I had to come back down 30 flights and get reassigned. This hotel is a huge tourist processing machine. It's impersonal and cold. Also, literally cold. There was a freezing draft in the room and despite turning the thermostat up to 80 degrees, I was cold all night long. And unlike even the cheapest hotels these days, there was no coffee in the rooms or even in the lobby. WHAT?",2,1
"I always gave wyndham a high rating but this one really deserves a negative. Very rude and unprofessional staff, very small room, carpet of the room was torn. Lights over the 23rd floor elevator, where I stayed were all broken. Overall, it was like a one star motel. It seemed like the front desk staff would receive a kick back from the drivers. I specifically requested a yellow cab, when I came down, a black car was waiting for me, I refused and asked for yellow cab. The receptionist was hesitant but finally he called a yellow cab. I have very sharp hearing and overheard him telling the driver to charge me $90.00 for the airport, so I asked the driver to turn on his meter who was hesitant as well. Upon my insistence, he turned it on and it only cost me around $65.00. I recommend",1,1
"I stayed for two nights arriving and departing from Penn Station. The hotel is perfectly located for getting in/out and around NYC. The rooms are tiny (no king beds), bathrooms dated and only sort of functional but service great. Avoid the ""Executive"" room - it's European at best and I think it would be better named some other way. There are no desks in the rooms and the beds are twins! The price was right - ~$300/night but I'd trade another $100+ for a room that made sense. Second to the location - the service was great. The agent at the front desk was very helpful and very nice. I probably won't stay there again but if you're on a budget and don't mind small rooms - I'd recommend it.",2,1
"I chose the hotel because of the great historic nama, good location, and ok price the hotel site was giving me. When you arrive in the lobby you see remnants of the hotel's historic standing, however, when you enter your room it seemed ok, nice confortable king bed, tv worked, acceptable wifi, etc. , But when you enter the bathroom, the nightmare starts. Overall the bathroom was run down, it looked as if it hadn't received an uplift in general maintenance for over 30 years.   When the shower worked , it was very difficult to establish a temperature equilibrium of the water, but ok, that was acceptable. When however the water was shut off from noon to three and I was told to go to another room to shower, that did if for me. They gave me a 50 dollar rebate off my bill of over 2000",1,1
"Don't let the plush lobby or the smartly dressed bell hops fool you.  It stops there.   We were a family of 4 and arrived at the hotel at 1.30pm hoping for an early check-in.  Told to come back at 3.oopm (check-in time)    Arrived back at 3.30pm and was told our room was not ready.  Really.   We were clearly not impressed and suddenly we were told a  very nice suite was available.  Well if this was a nice suite then I must not get out much.   It was on 34th floor and was about the size of shoe box at $510.00 a night.  The bathroom was tiny much like an aircraft toilet, but there was a bath but don't get excited, the floor in the bath was scaled and flaky which you had to stand in as it doubled for the shower.   My son was sleeping on a pull out sofa which clearly had not been",2,1
"Even if they restored the hotel it has not been at the level of expectations. Poor service at all levels, nobody ask on the phone , neither front desk nor housekeeping. There is no room service. you have a big empty fridge noisy in the room...there is no pressure in the water tub nor in the shower...I request a room with view on the Empire state , I got view on the hudson river... I asked to change , no way !!! Aircon was not warm enough on cold day and very hot on tempered days... Good service of airport transport with nice drivers... In any case as my predecesseur said I will not come back because the quality price value is not acceptable...",2,1
"I don't know what they did with the $70 million in renovations, but they didn't spend it fixing up the rooms. Absolutely the worst hotel experience I've ever had. One night was more than enough for me. I checked out the next morning and found a beautiful room 2 blocks away at the springhill suites for the same price. Don't walk, run from the Wyndham New Yorker. It needs to be torn down. It's an embarrassment to the Wyndham name.",1,1
"4 star, no way. 3 star at best. The rooms are tiny and the bathrooms are still stuck in the 40's.  I am forced to stay here with work so have been a guest many times and I would never pay money to stay here due to the noise, even on the 37th floor you hear everything due to poor windows. You hear everything from the room next door due to paper thin walls as well.  A very old, tired hotel.",2,1
"Very poor rating. The sink was not draining all, we asked the staff 2x to check but no one did. The tub was so sharp (maybe not finished) that we cannot be barefoot in taking a shower. This was reported and I was told that someone will come in 30 minutes, no one showed and was never fixed or anyone got back with us (we stayed for 4 nights). Also we asked for a lotion and no one showed up as promised. We called 3x and the 3rd time no one answered or picked up the phone.  Also, you can hear the next room when guests takes a shower or flush the toilets.",2,1
"My wife and I stayed at the hotel for four days at the beginning of August, for our anniversary. We were able to check in relatively quickly, but the room was right next to building works taking place on the outside of the building. That together with a dirty bathroom prompted us to request a room change. The change was accommodated quickly. Disappointing not to have coffee machines in room.  Main issues with this hotel are to do with the décor, it's old and tired and in dire need of some upgrade works. Staff were helpful and friendly.",2,1
"Wow. Couldn't believe how horrible. Had paint peeling on the bathroom wall. No coffee maker in the room and after took shower discovered NO hairdryer. It took 1.5 hrs to get them to send one up. Of course my hair was dry by then. The hot water came and went almost burning me. They charged up for 2 full nights of parking the car even though we arrived at 9pm on Fri night and left at 5am Sun. Their parking voucher said that we would only be charged $20 for 8 hours or less. However when we brought it up when checking out the employee said that it would ""take a while"" to contact the garage and fix this issue. We had a plan to catch and could not wait. They also made a big deal about us booking this hotel off of Hotwire when we checked in. I think that may be why we got a postage",1,1
I am staying at this hotel right now and I have had problems with my room for 2 days in a row now. On both days the problem was reported to front desk and now I have requested to move to another room and they are refusing to do so claiming they have no free rooms in a hotel with a 1000+ rooms. Now I have to waste my time and wait for someone to come and fix the issue before I can even leave my room. This is completely unacceptable and waste of my time and money. I will never stay in this hotel again and would not recommend it to anyone. There are better places in New York that offer superior customer service and value.,1,1
"I travel to NY every fall and this is by far the most uncomfortable hotel I've ever stayed in NY. My room was extremely tiny. Space from the foot of the bed to the wall was probably 12 inches. I could barely get in bed on the side that was by the desk. The closet was so tiny I had to hang my clothes at an angle as the hanger would not fit straight in unless I left the closet door open, which would have restricted my movement in the room even more. The bathroom was outdated--mint green tiles and no counter space to speak off. And I had to put up with what sounded like a faucet dripping but much, much louder coming from the panel on the wall (if you open the door to the room, it would be behind the door). I heard it over the tv and all night to the point that I could not sleep.",1,1
"The hotel is old and showing its age despite the infusion of resources from Wyndham. The rooms are cramped and small, the halls dark and drab, the paint and tiles chipped and rough around the edges. The shower water was inconsistently hot and cold.   The conference area too was showing its age. The meeting  rooms were dark and windowless. The location is central, but busy and transient. In all, for the price, there are other better options.",2,1
"Been to nyc a few times first time at the new yorker. As title states great location, but the rooms are grubby, the hotel could be a lot cleaner. Wifi worked on and off and you have to pay for luggage service. Personally I have no issue paying $2.00 per bag but this is the first time I have ever had to pay just seemed odd. Wouldn't go back.",2,1
"The price was high (£200), the room (""metro"") was tiny, with no tea/coffee, or fridge, or any facilities apart from the TV, and barely enough room to move around the ""queen"" bed. The check in clerk was brusque and rude. However this is New York, everything is expensive, and it's not like the place was uncomfortable or anything, just way overpriced for what's on offer. No coffee, no breakfast. Just a bed. Four star??? I think not. More like two at most. Elsewhere I'd expect to pay £50 for this level of luxury. By way of comparison we paid just £93 for the Hilton Garden in Feeport and had a massive room with king size bed and all the trimmings.",2,1
"Staff was mean and rude. Took my friend's room key away and wouldn't give it back. Wasn't allowed to bring any guests to our room because ""rooms are only allowed 4 people"" when our suite was booked for 6 people. I know of two other girls who got their room keys taken away from them by their larger,intimidating security crew and the girls ended up having to call the cops on the hotel because they were not allowed into their own room when they were paying how many hundreds of dollars for it?! I will never be staying at this hotel ever again.",1,1
"I must say that front desk, housekeeping, and bell staff were wonderful.  However, I was just very disappointed as I was expecting Wyndham quality. Being an older hotel in the heart of Manhattan, we expected the room to be a bit on the small side, but there was barely enough space to walk around the bed. We did NOT expect a full-sized bed where a queen-sized bed was advertised on the website, however.  In addition, there were not enough outlets to charge electronic devices. Also, we expected an in-room coffee-maker - also advertised on the website - yet there was none. I had to go down to the lobby to purchase a cup of coffee every morning - an added expense on top of an already excessive room rate. Also, the lack of a mini-fridge was a noticeable omission of a modern amenity.",2,1
Room was extremely small as bed took up over half the room.  Front desk check-in people were not at all friendly.  I would never ever stay there again!,2,1
"I booked the Wyndham New Yorker hotel on Priceline as a 4 star hotel; it's possible that it could be as high as a 1 star hotel. This hotel is a total DUMP. The room was so small, and outdated and the bathroom looked like it had black mould around the filthy looking bath tub that was completely scratched up and old. The toilet was no better; disgusting looking. I tried to change our room but they were fully booked. We had no choice to stay there one night, but we cancelled our 2nd night and moved over to the JW Marriott Essex House which is the other extreme of the Wyndham; the JW is really nice and clean.  Do yourself a favour and stay away from the Wyndham New Yorker.",1,1
"My reviews are very fair and I don't often leave negative reviews but in this instance I'm afraid I our stay at this hotel was not what I would expect for c£195 per night. Whilst the room was clean it was small for this price. I would have also expected tea and coffee making facilities for the amount paid. There was also no in house catering. The only reason for booking this hotel was it's proximity to Madison Square Gardens (due to a concert attendance) On a further note, this area of 8th avenue is not the most salubrious. In summary, the hotel was ok as somewhere to lay one's head but for £195 a night way way over priced.",2,1
If your planning on seeing a show at Madison Square Garden and having a good time this hotel is NOT for you. Never felt so disrespected by the people who work there. Rooms are small and not that clean.,1,1
Arrived in room and no where to even open a suitcase!!!!  After checking in both cupboards there were no tea or coffee facilities and the clock by the bed was broken.  The carpet in the room felt dirty & everything looked very tired & old.  On entering the tiny bathroom it was dirty with mildew & grime!!!!,1,1
"The room was kind of small, almost no available electrical plug, the bathroom was very small, and the shower temperature kept changing from cold to (really) hot. Renovations are under way outside. This place is really all about location (which is perfect). Walking distance to Javits Center and Times Square. But for that price I would expect better.",2,1
"Had a meeting nearby which made the location good.  The staff was nice, not their fault how overpriced this place is.  I couldn't believe the hallway when I got up to my floor.  Metal brown doors made me feel like I was in some low end apartment.  My room was tiny.  Small TV, I'm guessing 22 inches.  The room was generally clean but you kick that kick in the gut feeling when you walk in of $379 + tax, really.  I asked when I checked in if it was busy given the rate and was told no actually a little quiet.   If you see my other reviews they tend to be positive.  I will say they had a very good fitness center.",2,1
This hotel needs to upgrade many rooms and should not sell rooms that are undergoing serious construction works,2,1
"The hotel started with the rude service of staff standing at the front door and not opening the door to us, since our hands were full of luggage.   Check is was smooth and was told we had a nice spacious room since we paid extra for the Business Premiere Package for an executive double bed.  The room was so small that it could not hold the luggage and two people without some work.   The bathroom was too small to hold the towels - so they had them stored in the closet which was too small for hangers - those were placed on the desk which was of a size similar to a 1st graders school desk and could not fit an adult.  The quality of amenities were less then suitable for a mid-range hotel and the only amenity that worked was the iron.   The soaps were blue and would be stained with a",1,1
"We were here the evenings of Sept. 26 and 27 2014. Here is a list of the great things about it:  1. Location  Everything else was subpar.  For starters, they are renovating, though they don't tell you this when you make your reservation. It was a good excuse for why things weren't so hot, I guess.   Its common in NYC to get a tiny room for $300 a night, but you can find that anywhere. What you won't find at this place is many amenities, e.g., complimentary coffee? Come on guys, they SELL coffee in the lobby, and old pastries from a place called Tick Tock Diner which is connected. Eating there is pretty blah, this is NYC, it should be really good, it's not. Everyone went across the street and stood in line at Starbucks.  On the topic of nickel and diming you, if you want to leave",1,1
"I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights from May 31st to June 1st. I booked online from home in Australia as it was close to Times Square and the subway etc. I paid extra for a room with a view and unfortunately the view outside the window was of construction... I advised the hotel manager and unfortunately there were no extra rooms to stay in for that night, however the next night I was upgraded to a suite which had no view; only an extra couch and a coffee table. I wouldn't recommend to stay in this hotel as the rooms are tiny and you're paying more than what you should be (unless you want the hustle and bustle of Times Square).",2,1
"Stayed here years ago. Hated it. Had to stay here again. Still hate it. Good location, but you can do better than this place. Anyplace is better. Staff is generally OK. Rooms are small and dark. Internet absolutely sucks.",2,1

The rooms are tiny, the carpet is filthy , there are stains on the bedding , the windows are so bad it's like sleeping outside and don't even ask about the bathroom it's so small and in a terrible state of repair , I would never ever stay here again or recommend this hotel to anyone and the travel company which we booked this holiday with will be notified it really is that bad totally ruined our stay in New York .",1,1
"The sound of Niagra Falls on the 33rd floor. It was urination against our door. During our first night's stay, I was horrifically awakened by commotion at the room's entry door. I opened my eyes to the sight of an undressed man forcefully prying open the door. Only the top chain/lock was keeping him out. He was repeatedly yelling to let him in. My screams back that he had the wrong room were ignored. My husband had to physically push him out and while bracing the door, I called for security. Unbelievably, I was asked if it could have been housekeeping. Do housekeeping uniforms at the Wyndam consist of only underwear? I begged for security to help us. In the meantime, the man refusing to leave, urinated at our door. Finally, security arrived and the man was escorted away. Shaken",1,1
"We were unable to take a hot shower in the evening before our dinner. We had no hot water!. It took over an hour for manager to send someone. After the fourth time I called, he said he was never informed of the situation. We took cold showers and was later for our dinner cruise. Also, the next morning, the security guard stopped me and asked me for my room key after I had been coming in and out all morning. I asked if she was asking everyone because she didn't ask another white gentleman for his key. She said it was visible on his person. I though she was being racist but she said she was just doing her job. I accepted that and proceeded to the elevator when she asked me to wait while she called the manager because I was giving her a hard time. .I never raised my voice or made a",2,1

I am disappointed that the Wyndham Hotel company is reluctant to invest any money in the property.

You're talking to me and I'm in the room. Next stupid question?  Next morning I went across the street to Starbucks at 6:30am. When I got to my room I found I'd been keyed out.

"As a frequent traveler both in the US and abroad, I expect a hotel with a 4-star rating to feel luxurious and to offer high-end amenities to justify the rating.  It is difficult to understand how the New Yorker has achieved this rating.  There are many 2-star highway motels that offer more.  The New Yorker's room service consists of a phone number to the diner in the lobby, but there was no menu in the room, not even a breakfast order sheet.  There was no coffee machine in the room.  The room was clean and the beds were comfortable, but the furnishings were shoddy and the room felt bare.  The public areas appear to have been recently painted, but the decor is rather sad-looking.  Although these things may sound trivial, when the rate for a double room can be more than $400 a",2,1

Our flight was cancelled so we arrived a day late but we did email the hotel to let them know (to which we got no reply). Upon arrival we were told we would still have to pay for the previous day, which was understandable. But on check put they made us pay for the whole amount and on top of that a no show fee even though we emailed the day before we arrived.  We had booked a standard queen room and were put in a metro double with a tiny double bed instead for me and my sister to share and when I queried it the woman at the counter first said they were sold out of the queens so I asked for a refund on what we had payed and then she said that a queen room is the same as the metro double that we",1,1
"Honestly, I knew when booking this hotel it wasn't going to be luxurious. I am very familiar with the City, living only an hour and half away. But, I was looking for somewhere to stay for the night that was inexpensive and convenient. Normally, I would avoid this type of hotel, but gave it a try instead. Needless to say, even going into it with lower expectations, I was disappointed. The room we booked was one of the ""recent upgrades"" I found this very hard to believe. The bathroom had holes in the wall where something once hung. The toilet was just gross as was the shower, and extremely dated! The room was very small, which is quite common in NYC. That is not my complaint. However, in such a small room, why put a desk with a HUGE chair that you can barely maneuver around? The",2,1
I travel to NYC 3 times a month and booked the Wyndhan New Yorker after finding it online as close to Penn Station. My first visit was fine with an upgrade to a slightly better room welcomed. Tried it a second time but regretted my decision immediatly. I booked a room online and arrived on Tuesday Sept 2nd at 4:15pm only to find out my room was not ready yet. The front desk clerk put me in an alternate room (room 2135) at the same rate but mentioned several times it was smaller but had a view but since I was traveling alone it would probably be fine. Smaller was an understatement. After I unpacked and showered about 20 minutes later I saw a note from the manager Ann Petersen was stuffed under my door alerting me that there was going to be no hot water from 1am that night to 5am,2,1
"I was a student staying with EHS within this building (and that is a whole other bad review). However, my mum came to visit me for 5 days and stayed within this hotel. I stayed with my mum in her room during her stay and for the extortionate amount of money she paid for the week, the service wasn't good. The first morning we awoke early to get out and about, we found that the plumbing was not working. This meant that we could not use the toilet, brush our teeth or get a shower. Therefore we was stuck in the room. When my mum called to the reception to find help in resolving this problem, she was rudely informed that there was nothing that can be done. My mother kept calm and kept insisting that we needed to use a working bathroom. Eventually they allowed us to move into a",2,1
"As a frequent traveler to NYC, when checking in to the New Yorker was a fantastic experience. We were delighted to be staying at the Wyndham, as I have not ever stayed at one before. The doormen, the bellhops, all of them were fantastic. The reason for my stay was to move my children into NYC for college.  Staying there was fine, it was the after math of having left items in the room where the hotel fell apart. After seven phone calls to housekeeping, lost and found and the manager, a total of ZERO were returned. Even with the front desk's help of connecting me through to the manager of housekeeping, the call went straight to voicemail.  FInally getting through was a nightmare.

The Information desk likewise, is a sub-contarcted service. The hotel advertises 24 food and beverage - but this again is not owned or managed by he hotel and is a separate company (Diner) attached to the hotel.

"I have travelled all over the world and stayed in countless numbers of different rating hotels. I can say without exaggeration that this is the most over priced, overrated, poorly staffed hotel I have ever stayed in. Below are some of the issues that arose as we encountered them during our stay.   Keeping in mind that the Wyndham New Yorker hotel is supposedly rated as a four star hotel and we paid $816 dollars + $14 city tax + 14.95% tax + a pre authorisation of $1200 on credit card to cover ""incidentals"" for a 4 night stay. Our final bill totaled at over $990 after taxes which works out at $248~ €185 per night ROOM ONLY. We had to pay $200 cash deposit as our card would not cover this $1200 preauthorization bill with all the extras.   - Horribly mannered staff in reception",1,1

Although the some of the rooms have been upgraded, the hallways, elevators and much of the lobby look the same as they looked back in teh 1930s.

Lobby -- Pretty -- maybe it will be better than I thought. 3. Out of elevator -- Floor must be under renovation -- just a coat of base paint -- all very unattractive. 4. Room -- Small (expected that in NY) and ugly -- again, some base paint -- moldings very scuffed up.  Dark rug.  Not much lighting. 5. Bathroom -- Mold around tub.  Too small to put toiletries anywhere except a very narrow shelf under the mirror.  Bathtub had stains and gouges in the porcelain. 6. Desk -- if the chair is out, it hits the bed -- no way to walk by, and the chair is heavy to move. 7. Electrical outlets -- insufficient.  There is one behind the",1,1

"The service at this hotel is horrendous! After having a glowing review for this hotel everything changed when they took money from my account for damages that were not there! When I spoke to someone, I was told that the room was more than likely damaged before we stayed in there. Making me think that this is a regular occurrence. The supervisor/ hotel manager has refused to call us back and everyone I have spoken to can not explain the charges and  at one point I was told that there were not any.  I'd advise people to check their rooms before they check in. I am so disappointed and this has really ruined my experience.",1,1
"Worst hotel I ever stayed in, and it's not cheap, Room was dirty, even bathroom was dirty.  In the bathroom there were few spots of mildew.  we took 2 rooms and both of them were like that.  Room is very small like motels.  It's better you stay in motel than this Hotel.",2,1
"Wow... don't even know where to start... ok. Let me give you a small piece of information. I'm picky. Yes I'm am. However, I'm able to stay in one star hotels and love them. So, it is not the price or luxury that make my mind is actually the whole experience.  With that being said. Everything was wrong.  I went to New York by myself to do some business. As soon as I arrived at the hotel, with my strong accent, without saying the reason that brought me to the city I checked in. The receptionist asked me if I'd like to add anybody else to my room, I said no and that was all. No explanation about the city, offering map, how to use the wifi, nothing. I mean, I didn't really need that, but usually when they see tourists they offer additional information. Nothing. That was just a",2,1
They do not explain any charges they are going to put on your credit card during check in like the $45 deposit per night on top of your full stay charges. When you question the extra charges on your credit card they are rude and do not do a good job of explaining things politely. The bathrooms are very small. Not only that there is no countertops to put your stuff on. They try to dime and nickel you for everything. Be very very careful. Do not bother to call front desk after 9 pm they do not answer. Tried to reach front desk to ask how to get on Wifi since there were no instructions in the room on how to do it. I had to go downstairs to find somebody to talk to. Then the free Wifi coverage was very bad. But of course they have other Wifi coverage they say is good but they charge,2,1
"Got there for work last night, did not have a room with 2 beda. Got up to the room, bathroom was dirty, very small and shower did not even work properly. The walls r so thin that we could hear the person next door turn on the shower. Not worth the money, we were supposed to be there 2 days but ended up checking out as it was so disappointing. Staff r also rude and unaccomodating.",1,1
"I arrived from an international flight late in the evening; putting me at the hotel at roughly 10:55pm.  I just wanted to lay down and rest.   The lobby is certainly spacious and pretty.  It has a lot of that old New York feel.  The staff seemed relatively friendly, though I saw them snapping a bit at come customers and walking away from others.  This is about where my patience ran out.  First of all, there was a line 20 people deep to check in.  It took almost an hour waiting on line to check in.  I get up to my floor and after making my way out of the elevators; the hallway was barely big enough to get my luggage down.  I then get to my room, and when I walk in; my mouth dropped. My room was about as big as a king size bed.  I am not referring to the bed.. I mean the room.",2,1
"We were guests in your hotel 4.-7. of July. Let me start from the beginning.  	We made reservation by the phone. When my gf was speaking with someone, she said she wants queen size bed, and we got confirmation that we will have queen size bed. Then, when we arrived, we asked if there was a possibility to chose a view. And from desk receptions told us that she will talk with us after she finishes what she was doing at the moment. And, couple minutes after, she handed us keys for the room. When we asked about the view again, she told us that was only choice. For sure It is not possible that they had only one choice. I would say that she forgot what we asked her, and just wanted to finish with us when we asked again. That would be the first thing we didn’t like. Next, when we",1,1
"The Hotel is in a very good location. Walking distance from time square, shops . McDonalds is across. The Hotel itself seems to have been built in 1929. Lot of the original fittings are still there. There is a bad odour (smell) everywhere in this hotel which is disgusting. Maybe because it is old. The rooms are very small. There is hardly any space to put your luggage and things. Bathrooms have old tiles that have been painted and paint is peeling off in places. It is very small . The old  bath tub seems to have been painted as well. Corridors are old and depressing. The paint work is very poor.  The reception is always very busy . I  arrived at the hotel at midnight and had to wait to check in for over 45 minutes. I had booked 2 rooms. The unfriendly duty manager  offered us",2,1
"This hotel is absolutely appalling.   We called and booked our  2 rooms 1 month in advance and we specifically requested an adjoining room. When we checked in we were told that there are no adjoining rooms in this hotel, we were never told this when we booked over the phone. Also, when we then asked the receptionist to at least put the rooms side by side, she glared at us and refused to do it and then placed us on opposite ends of the floor. The receptionist were also unapologetic about the 30 minute long wait to check in and the inconvenience caused by the placement of the rooms.   The rooms look nothing like the photos on the website. There is barely any space in the room, there is no place to put your luggage and it is impossible to get comfortable. The bathrooms are mouldy,",1,1
"This hotel has a GREAT location, especially if you arrive in NYC via Amtrak. But it is not a particularly good place to stay.  It's noisy, a bit dirty and in desperate need of an upgrade.  It appears that Wyndham has recently taken over--but as of today (7/14/2012) it's a bit of a dump.  My bathoom was so dirty you could run your finger along the dust accumulating on the edges of the tile.  The internet barely worked.  The elevators took so long, people thought they were broken.  It's a bit of a hang-out for young people hitting the city for a good time--which is fine, but families beware.  Here's the tip off: They put guards at the entry to the elevator lobby to ""card"" people coming in. I stayed there because Priceline was listing it as a 4* hotel at a deep discount (unnamed",2,1
"This hotel was awful and I will never be returning.  Upon arriving, which was 12.30am so we were very tired, we were greeted by a very misberale man on the reception desk.  This was just the beginning.    Our room was the size of a postage stamp, once we were both inside with our cases there was no room at all.  There is minimal storage and no where to put anything out in the bathroom so we had to keep pretty much everything in wash bags.  I was desparate for a shower and a cup of tea before going to bed as we had been travelling for ages.  There were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room so we popped to a shop down the road.  When I got back to the room I turned on the shower and was greeted but a spluttering of water that the spat out loads of black dirt into the",1,1
"We stayed at the new yorker in April for  5 nights. The location is fine, the hotel is pleasant, and yes, rooms are quite small, but if you're in NYC to have fun and walk around, this could be easily overlooked. We were assigned a room that became quite noisy all through the day, due to renovations the hotel was going under. If you're planning to sleep in the morning, forget it... Better sleep earlier in the night. The agent at front desk didn't mention that small detail about the room.. we were very tired upon arrival, and front desk was very full, so we'd rather stick to the room instead of complaining...  Also, we had a problem with delivery of packages, though, and a very unpleasant experience with manager Ronny. I wasn't aware that the hotel ""closes"" on Saturdays for",2,1

Finally, the third room was quiet….Rooms are very clean, but VERY OLD and dated…Showers are nothing great…Bathrooms have light green tiles and are old!!!The only perfect thing about this hotel is the location…I",2,1
"There wasnt a minibar in the room, also there isnt coffee maker and complimentary water in the room. It is not like a 4 stars hotel. Bathroom was very old and dirty. And our room keys wasnt working, we had been waiting for an assistance to open the door and finally we can enter the room after 1 hour. They cannot solve the problem and our room was changed to another one.  The receptionist, Mrs. Gabina was very rude to us. We wanted to add our company details in the information section of the bill, thats all i wanted. She was acting that wasnt her duty to make it insistently. But pretending she was doing a favor for us. After half an hour, she did at last. And she raised her voice while we were discussing.",2,1
The hotel is old and the rooms are very small.  Be aware that the majority of the rooms are used for live in college students.  Just not very professional as a hotel -- especially for the price we paid.,2,1
"We stayed there for 3 days. It was totally disappointed. I will never stay here again.  No minibar No complimentary water, coffee maker (in old rooms) Old and dirty bathtub Doors are so close to eachother Its sounds waking you up. Wardrobe size is not enough for 2 people. Good location i have to say that one.",2,1
"I reserved a room on the Wyndham website for a room described as the largest room type in the Wyndham New Yorker hotel. It was described as a queen bedded room. Well, the room was tiny, and I know about New York hotel room sizes. The bed was a double bed, not a queen size. I was only staying for one night. So, I didn't bother to try to get it changed. I did complain at the front desk as I was checking out. I told the woman clerk of my dissatisfaction and why. She apologized, but did not change the rate I paid for the room. Instead, she said that she was putting a note in my record saying that I was eligible for a free upgrade that I could use ""the next time I stay there"". Really? Do you think I'm going to believe that any more than I would again believe the description of the",2,1
"I'm a frequent traveler and trip advisor reader, so am very confused as to how this property has managed 4 stars. I gave 2 stars for location (next door to Penn Station, can't be beat for train commuters). I would give another 1/2 star for the pleasant receptionist and house keeper. Other than that, rooms are noticeably old,  tiny and not the cleanest. I also did not get the ""above and beyond"" vibe from staff. I saw a man with a name tag talking on his cell phone on the lower level. I politely interrupted to ask a brief question, he advised me he worked at the hotel, but at the concierge desk (apparently that means my trivial question was beneath him). He did give me a slighlty rude reply and continued his phone conversation. Message to employees, if you don't want to help",2,1
"Initially told upon checkin that it was our anniversary and not sure if they do anything for that. Maybe an upgrade or something? The receptionist was very nice and said they would send something up to our room very soon. We stayed 3 nights... Nothing ever came!The room was so tiny. We were not in a renovated room. The closet was too small to even store our suit cases. The bathroom was old. It had a toilet that was like a public toilet with the handle you would kick with your foot to avoid the germs. Pedestal sink and a 3"" glass shelf that could barely fit my toothbrush and deodorant. The shower was horrible. Went from scolding hot to ice cold throughout and the water came out like it was the end of a garden hose.  You could here pipes, flushing and whatever other noises",2,1
"On entry to the reception area the New Yorker looks very grand and luxurious but it is a bit of a facade as the rest of the building and rooms are very dated and look like nothing has been touched since the 80's.  The bell hop was very helpful and friendly and I did not begrudge tipping him for his service and local advice but all the door staff and security I found to be quite ignorant and not interested in making my stay an enjoyble experience.   The worst of all was the ticket office for the shows and tours, the gentleman on the desk turned up late with no apology and as there was no big comission in it for himself he simply beaome unhelpful and quite rude. There was also a bmall older lady who worked on information who was very unkempt and uninterested and when I asked here",2,1
Very small rooms.  No where to put cases or anything else.  Poor quality furniture and accessories. Bathroom shabby.  Very disappointed with this hotel especially as it was recommended by agent from first choice travel shop.  We had to ask for a bigger room and although we were moved there was little difference in the furnishings albeit it a slightly larger room.  Would not stay here again unless making sure we had a room (large) above the 19th floor on a corner.,2,1
"My sisters and I (5 of us) booked a suite at this hotel. I had read the reviews and felt that it might not be perfect but it would be a nice stay. First, our balcony was under construction and was full of workers and noise all day, starting bright and early at about 7:30 am. All the balconies were under construction so there was no moving. And one of the selling points of this hotel is the view, hard to enjoy through scaffolding. Next, while they're in the process of remodeling the rooms they clearly hadn't gotten to this bathroom. The bottom of the tub, where you have to stand to take a shower, was gouged out. Not a look that makes you want to take a shower. Also, the water temperature was inconsistent and some of us came close to getting burned. On the first day, they sent",2,1
"The New Yorker is located in a prime NYC location, right across from MSG. For this and other reasons, it's a well known New York hotel, but I was so unimpressed by this place. We needed a last minute hotel and thought it would be cool to stay at the New Yorker as we never had before. We made the mistake of staying during the dog show which was across the street. I love dogs, but there were dogs EVERYWHERE and it seemed like no one cared about us since we weren't a part of it. The service wasn't good and our room was so small and outdated. We checked out the next day and ended up staying at a Double Tree which was 100% better and a more comfortable stay.",2,1
"This hotel charades as a hotel with panache.  Do not be fooled by the lobby, which is the only stylish thing about this hotel.  The front desk help lacks good customer service skills yet this is the customers initial contact and is the face of the hotel.  Rude, rude, I get the whole NYC thing but REALLY this is taking the persona a little far.  If you are flying I suggest you look into other hotels that understand and care that if the airport will not allow flights in this is a non controllable incident. They don't care and will not offer any type of adjustments to your bill.  Speaking of bill, they will run random authorizations on your credit card.  The rooms are match boxes and need makeovers. The one star they have nice linen, you will need a good night sleep after dealing",1,1
I was not impressed at the price I paid for a a room with a view because the view wasn't all that great. My biggest beef is the size of the rooms. Upon entering our room with a view I noticed that I would have to walk sideways to get between the bottom of the bed and the wall in order to get to the window with the great view. Also I had eaten something that didn't agree with me and so I really needed to get to the bathroom. No sooner had I parked my butt on the toilet when my wife opened the bathroom door jamming my toe against the toilet causing me great pain. I found out later when I got back home that the great pain was really a broken toe. When I complained to an older Latin man at the front desk I was not offered another room but was told that it was the best I was going to,1,1
"Unfortunately this hotel really needs to make some changes.  The room and bathroom were awful - old, tired and not clean.  Location was great and convenient, but I definitely felt I wasted my money as there are so many other much better hotels in the city.  And they charged for bag storage!!!  Just a suggestion - watch the elevator doors when someone walks through - twice I had them slam on me and it left a nice little bruise on my wrist.  Maybe check the sensors so they don't slam on an older guest??? Second Wyndham hotel that has received a sub-par review from me - feels like Wyndham may need to check out their hotels and do some updating.",1,1
"I stayed here for 5 nights. The rooms are TINY. Like 150 square feet tiny. They're cleanish, but old, so you can never really get it that clean looking.  They're doing construction, which you don't find out about until you are awoken by it the next morning. Hammering, drilling, and sawing starting at 6 am. I complained and they moved us directly upstairs from our previous room, which really didn't fix the problem.  The beds are rock hard and horribly uncomfortable. And the showers had two settings: scalding hot or ice cold.  So, after 5 restless nights and mornings, I left the hotel tired, less than clean feeling, and grumpy.  Just DON'T stay here!!!",1,1

"I entitled this room(s) because upon opening the door to the first room we called down for another room. My husband and I were there for a medical conference and expected a fantastic room as that was the norm. The first room, a suite, was small, dark, smelly and musty. The bathroom had a public style type of toilet, moldy bath tiles and rusty fixtures. Upon being granted another suite on another floor, it was more of the same. Needless to say, we did not stay and left. The pictures are misleading. We asked for a refund for the conference and there were no questions asked. We believe we were not the only ones dissatisfied. We suggest you book elsewhere or at the least ask to see the room before committing to staying. I don't know where the good rooms are that others are raving",1,1
"I've titled my review in such a way since upon entering the hotel, the foyer is impressively stately in appearance and my first impressions were positive. However, my experience beyond that initial entrance was predominantly negative.  Firstly, although we were informed beforehand that our room had been 'upgraded', we were not told of the additional charges this would incur. We ended up having to pay an additional £400 for our trouble, which would not have been an issue had we at least known of the expense.  Secondly, our 'upgraded' room featured an all around view of scaffolding (another detail the hotel did not view fit to disclose). Moreover, one bedroom had a door that was supposed to have been fitted for the bathroom as it had a lock on it. So, following our first day's",2,1

The bathrooms are so tiny that you cannot place your personal items in that room.du to  the continued remodeling many rooms are affected with poor water pressure and dirty water.

Like many, ""High End"" Hotels (Often in Name or Supposed reputation only, and don't confuse this for one..), The Wyndam New Yorker, has many, ""Levels"" of Service depending on how much money you spend...mark my words on this one, it doesn't matter how much money you spend at the new yorker, or how far you book ahead, you could end up getting a room that barely fits queen bed for $400-$500/per night, or a room with a decent size for the same price, but it all comes down to how much they think they can squeeze out of you for the long run.

"I saw a lot of good reviews and that is why we stayed here April 27 to May 3rd 2014, but I cannot agree. Some staff were pleasant, but overall it was a messy stay, not smooth. This Hotel is under renovation. If you book here remember to ask about having a room away from this work. The Hotel did not offer this information when I first enquired about our requirement that we must have a quiet room. When I called and asked right before the stay this information was revealed. The Hotel website offers breakfast and internet and  this was clearly stated on the hotel website as part of the suite rates advertised.  Our stay started with having to prove that these items were included in our stay, which was a nuisance (no one wants to have to start a stay complaining). It was just for",1,1

Bottom line - here are much better options in town.",2,1
"This is a two star hotel at best.  It would be fine if it claimed to be a two star hotel, but it pretends it's a four star, and that is a complete lie.  The rooms are small, old and dingy.  The shower is what you'd expect from a motel 6 in rural Nevada.  There are no amenities.   On the plus side, the Internet is fast, so if you want to live out some fantasy of being a super-hacker in your dark and depressing lair, this will do well for you.",2,1
"One thing you have to understand about Manhattan: stars mean nothing. An average 4 star hotel in the city is truly the equivalent of a 2 star hotel anywhere else in the country. Conversely, a 4 star hotel anywhere in the country is a luxurious palace. Meanwhile, this 4 star hotel, The New Yorker, is old, dirty, small, cramped, loud and outdated. It's also right next to an ambulance depot so you will hear blaring sirens blasting their way into thick midtown traffic all day and night. Since the windows are old they sound very close even if you are on a high floor. Do you like running the fan all night to help cut down on the noise from the hallway? Well tough luck because the AC system they have there does not have independent fan control. So you get to hear drunk tourists yelling",2,1
"Pros: Right by Penn station/Madison Square Gardens makes it very useful, classic exterior Cons: Small rooms, smelt damp, needs a refresh, shower as hot as the sun, thin walls  As an apparent four star hotel, and at the price point, this Wyndham really doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Three stars, maybe.  My room was small by American standards, could hear next door all the time, any tap that ran was as hot as the sun, the shower was a spitter that cycled between trying to burn me to death and freeze me to death and everything smelt damp - there's no extraction in the bathroom.

The closet was so narrow that the clothes hung sideways.  The bathroom did not have space to put cosmetics while getting ready.  The temperature of the water in the shower would change blasting with hot water at times.  There was room to walk around the bed and little else.  The location was good for the basketball games.  My main complaint was not getting points for the hotel stay with my loyalty program.",2,1
"At check in, not a smile. At 3pm my room is still not ready. Its ok me and my girlfriend were hungry so we were going to eat meanwhile. They charged us $8 just to hold our bags until the room is ready. Then they charge you $10 by night if you want a good connection internet. The room is smaller than NY hotels and much smaller than 4 stars hotel. The bathroom is terrible as the plumbing and you hear everybody taking showers .  in 5 days the cleaning lady came twice. They charge you also 25ct a minute to print your boarding place... My advice is get a hotel more comfortable little bit more pricey maybe but you will not regret it.",2,1
"We weren't going to be spending any time in the room so we booked the cheapest rate. The staff was great and super friendly. No complaints there.   However, we could hear everything going on in the room adjacent to us. It was as if there were a curtain, rather than a wall, separating the rooms. Along with that, the plumbing was extremely noisy! Any time someone got in the shower or flushed a toilet (on our floor) it sounded like a plane taking off. Not to mention the pillows were terrible. (I realize the pillow comment is only my onion). All in all, it made for one bad night of sleep. And we were only there for one night.   We were attending a conference in the city and Sunday was a tough day because we didn't get any sleep the night before. There was just so much noise.",2,1

I know space is tight in NYC but this was ridiculous. Even more ridiculous was they are trying to construct more rooms in the hotel. I do not know where!   Rooms where dated and needed upgrading for the price. The maids were good, they did a thorough job throughout our stay.  In general staff weren't very helpful and it took ages to speak to concierge. Also if you send them an e mail don't expect a reply which is rude.  When we checked out we were met by a wifi bill of 50 dollars which we didn't use but paid because we couldn't be bothered arguing as we would likely get nowhere.

A huge building with a lot of rooms. Look out many of them can only fit a bed. You have to jump in from the entry of your room. Don't look for a room service list or a minibar because there isn't.   Down stairs in the lobby it doesn't get better. Reception reather see you not bothering them and the concierge will not even give you a wifi password.   Thank god for the connecting restaurants. They are fine. Also the highlights close is excellent. But next time near times square.,2,1

Located within walking distance to many new York attractions however this hotel needs some repairs to their rooms. Tub chalking was dirty looking and repairs had been made to enamel in tub numerous times. Lacks electrical outlets making charging several devices difficult. Really is a charming hotel. Twice in one day the fire department was called due to people stuck in elevators resulting in closer to half the elevators and long lines to the service elevators. Will not be staying here again!,2,1
"This is the only hotel where they charge to store luggage between check out and departure.  And then on top of that, they broke my suitcase.  I was in a rush to get to the airport so couldn't really do anything but I was so angry- and no apology, nothing.  Kind of a 'we don't care' attitude.  This hotel really needs an overhaul, from the ageing bathrooms to the rooms, a facelift would be good.  It's convenient to the Javits and the only reason I stay there, but after this last fiasco, never again.",1,1
Stayed for 5 nights. With multiple taxes it was nearly 200 UDI per night. Room awfully small. The table was 10cm from the bed thus unusable. The bathtub was chipped thus unusable.  Paid for room with a view and there was no view due to construction.  Asked for late checkout of one hour and did not get it. There are much better hotel for that money.,2,1
"The hotel is old and dated. In an attempt to update the rooms the bathroom tile and tub was painted. The paint was chipping and made me feel like it was dirty. The heating vent was covered by part of the mirror so the bathroom was freezing. The couch in my room was so stained and filthy I would not even sit on it. One day the hot water was turned off with no notice. I realize that things happen but at least notify the guests so they can plan accordingly. The water in the shower would be fine one minute and then scorching the next. The heat was terrible so the room was always cold unless I had the heat at 85 which is crazy. The staff was nice although I checked out the evening before my planned date of departure, I had no problem paying for the day. But the staff could not",2,1
"So my wife and I decided we wanted to spend a weekend in the city, seeing a play, getting a meal and staying in a hotel and we fell for the trap. We saw a hotel next to penn station in the heart of the city for 20 percent less than other hotels and we jumped for it.  Sadly when we came back from dinner at a Michelin star restaurant and saw a great musical on broadway we had to come to this hotel. We got into the room and it was SMALL.....now we have been in small rooms before but this was just the first problem. The room looked run down and old, the bed sunk when we sat on it and the bathroom paint was peeling. In addition the room had an overall dirty feel to it. I see people giving it positive reviews and I guess they were staying in better rooms because this place to me was",2,1
"Whilst I frequently find niggles with hotels I stay in, this is the first time I have ever seriously considered cutting my losses on my prepaid booking and finding somewhere else to stay.  Where to start?  Firstly the decor.  The hotel has a magnificent art deco lobby with many original features intact but has been given a really kitch and unwelcoming feel.  Sad little groups of dingy chairs are beyond uninviting and the space is badly used.  Upstairs it gets worse.  The lift lobby and corridors are brown, dirty, frayed carpets, a faint odour of cigarette smoke left over from decades past and generally shabby and off-putting.  The bedroom had clearly been redecorated but the fabrics looked and felt cheap, the net curtains were grey, the windows filthy, the carpet unspeakable",1,1
"Booked thru Groupon-paid for queen -view room.Room on 35th floor-view was of scaffolding,construction netting and could not see anything else!Staff rude @ check-in.Tick tock diner on premises was good though.",2,1
"My partner and I journeyed to New York for the New Year celebrations and chose to say at one of the most iconic hotels in New York, the place where John F. Kennedy stayed as the 35th President of the United States.  Arrival and Check-in  As the hotel is undergoing some renovations on its external façade the immediate look of the hotel was not the most inviting. On entering the lobby, we were greeted by a wonderful art deco environment, the ceiling is quite breath-taking, it gave a great sense of arrival. The best way to describe the check in process is to relate it to a busy day at an airport check-in. The lines were very long and the hotel only had three people on the front-desk. As we arrived at 1530, we did not expect a long check-in; just after 1600 we arrived at the front",2,1
"Stayed for a week over Christmas, seemed perfectly adequate at a glance but if you dig deeper all is not what it seems. Rooms are tiny, there was no space to even place two suit cases, cleanliness was just about okay even though we tipped the cleaner every day!! Mould growing in the corners of the bath, water running hot or cold! Room looked directly into another window with full view of the bed but I would have been okay with it if this little incident didn't happen.  On the evening of check in - 21st December the receptionist asked if he could take a swipe of my card for security reasons, so I handed it over and thought that was that although when I asked him how much in total the room would be he couldn't give me answer. Our trip went as usual and when we came home I noticed",1,1
"Due to construction the noise was unbearable!!!!!  The staff was not interested in making adjustments.  Did not care that there was a problem.  Took a lot of time before they would even acknowlege that there was a problem. Took a Recording of noise to desk, were not impressed.  A previous review noted  the noise was only during the day, but depend upon when your day begins.  If you want to sleep in a little because your on vacation forget it. Probably the rudeness made the noise worse.",1,1
"We spent one night here during one of the busiest weeks of the year during a ""tour"" of iconic hotels and locations in NYC. Thank God we only booked one night at the New Yorker, that is all I can say.   -Terrible check-in Despite an early check-in,  we were met by an incredibly rude staff at front desk AND we did not get the room we paid for (on Booking.com, it was clearly described as a room with view on Empire State or Hudson River), and despite negotiation and friendliness from our part, we ended in a corner room on the 21st floor with a view on, well, random buildings of 8th Ave.  -Outdated rooms Beneath the decorum of the lobby, you will only find disappointment. Shady corridors leading to our room. Tiny bedroom with the deco we expected though, bed was OK. Bedroom was not",1,1
"This hotel was over priced,rooms were last refurbished in 1950s. Everything old,no tea/coffee facilities,no fridge,bathroom extremely old. I have been to NY many times before, paid a lot less and got a lot more! The only good feature was the fantastic view of the Empire State Building.",1,1
"The New Yorker may claim to be a four star property, but if you are in their metro room it is 3-stars max and even that is stretching it.  The room is small, not unlike the size of most other NYC rooms.  However, it is old.  The bed takes up most of the room, so only a foot or two away from a window that had a horrible draft.  It was bitterly cold outside, so this was less than ideal.  If the heat was turned up, the room was hot with the exception of a freezing draft while trying to sleep.  The bed was also very uncomfortable.  I asked to see if I could get a pillow top for over the mattress and all they said was that they could supply extra blankets to lay on.  Really?!  I asked about changing rooms, and the front desk said they were sold out.  That was not the case.  I booked",2,1
"The decision to stay in The New Yorker Hotel as it provide a good view of either the Hudson river or the Empire State building and is reputable. During our reservation, we opted for the view room that overlook the Empire State. However, upon our arrival we realized that there is renovation of the hotel just right outside of our room window. Although the view was not obstructed, it still spoiled our expectation (our picture taken from the room contained all the scaffolds of the constructions) from the room as we paid so much for it.   Our biggest concern is our privacy and the noise made from the construction. We requested a change in room that is not affected by the construction (view room overlooking the Hudson river). We were told it was not available and try again the next",2,1
"Stayed here in September...it was ok...nothing spectacular. My room was VERY small, and the bathroom was not clean when I arrived. The only person who bothered to care was the operator when I called to have my bathroom cleaned. She was very helpful. The night manager could care less about this issue. He did not seem pleasant either. As others have said, the location is good. That's about it. This place is not worth the stars it has. Would not stay here again.",2,1
"To start with, this is the second time I have stayed at the New Yorker, and I expected good things from it.  I had the misfortune of staying in one of their metro rooms and from the moment I entered the room (which was 2614) I regretted not staying in the cheaper 3*hotel (which i know had bigger rooms and included breakfast in the room price) I had canceled my 3* option in order to stay at this 4* hotel, the room without a doubt was the smallest I have ever stay in 20 years of visiting The big apple the wardrobe was so small the hanger had to be turned sideways so they would fit.   The cases when in the room completely blocked one side of the room, and the flat screen TV was tiny to go with the tiny room, so this in my Humble opinion was not a room worthy of a 4 star hotel (it",2,1
"Stay for three nights in The New Yorker during the Thanksgiving Macy's parade week so there weren't many rooms.  I booked months in advance not knowing that it was thanksgiving and when we checked in to the ""Tower Suite"" I was informed that it wasn't a suite and that no rooms with good views were available - disappointed but not the end of the world. Once given the keys we had to remind them that the breakfast should be included as quoted on the website - ""Breakfast Special (includes full American Breakfast for two) "". I was told that breakfast wasn't included, but when I complained I was given a voucher to the ticktock diner for a muffin and coffee - not the full American breakfast I saw the average American eat - I will probably get a lame excuse that it was a misunderstanding",2,1
"This is our 7th stay at the New Yorker Hotel. We were there for the Macy's parade. One would think that if you are a repeat customer, your room might be upgraded. Wrong!  Our room was so tiny! It serves a purpose. However, at the price they were charging ,they should be ashamed! I know from past experiences that they have better rooms. But, since we were only there for the parade - we didn't say anything. The front desk was poorly staffed. And, this really surprised me. So, at 9 PM we were waiting in a line. This was unusual. We asked for a late check out due to the fact we knew are float wouldn't be passing the grand stand until 11:45. The manager ok'd it for a 1 PM checkout, but guess what? At 12:10 PM we finally get up to the room after marching in the parade. We were tired,",2,1
"Lovely Art Deco building with many original touches. Busy but nice, staff always friendly and helpful.  Rooms tiny, prison cell sized but that's NY for you, the Metro double room is only big enough for one but that's ok when you're here on your own.   I unfortunately can't recommend this hotel due to the shocking showers which scald or freeze you or alternate between the two: they're actually dangerous to use they suddenly go so hot. With decent showers I'd have given this 5* but they really are so dreadful that I can't give it more than 2* and even that's generous as they really are dangerous.",2,1
"So where do I start. The rooms are very small and very dated. The bathroom has tiles with mold and a tub that must be 50 years old. The shower head is just a hole where water streams out either steaming hot or cold. The sink does not drain. Right after I gave the hotel my credit card (one I never use) the number got stolen obviously from one of their staff. It is an old dump, there are too many nice hotels in NYC to stay here. We moved to the W hotel Union Square for the same money. The place is awful and so not worth the money.",1,1
"I got this hotel on a deal with Expedia unpublished rates for a 4 start hotel expecting the level of a 4 star anywhere in the world. The hotel was maybe a 4 start back on the times of Marilyn Monroe and Dick Tracy... you get transported in time to an old and tired property. The elevators look like the tower of terror from MGM Studios in Disney. Room was so tiny, originally booked for 2 persons for two beds and I was assigned one bed with a hard mattress and not even a queen size bed. The bathroom needs URGENT renovation. They have a strong security just before the elevators? Why? Clueless during day hours , I might understand during late night times but during the day?  The property has so much potential but probably the owner doesn't want to invest or is not in the possibility",2,1
Lobby very crowded at all times. Water in shower didn't heat up for 20 minutes.  Room was loud and housekeeping came in twice when my pregnant wife was trying to sleep with do not disturb on door.  Conveient to subway.,2,1
"We recently stayed here and it was the last part of our trip of a lifetime, we had already been to Vegas (MGM) see other review, we also stayed at the westin st Francis in San Fran see other review, this hotel was disappointing on arrival, we were greeted by a woman who could barely speak to us, she demanded a credit card payment for $135, we told her we don't have a credit card we only had a cash card which we were advised to take instead of cash, she said she would have to take it off there straight away, we said no to start with as this was our spending money, she then refused to check us in, she did how ever say if we gave her $250 cash we would get that back when we leave, we told her that the last two hotels had just swiped our card and not taken any funds unless we used",1,1
"The bad experience started when we walked in the door, between the terrible service, the tiny rooms, the cramped beds, and the shower that burned and then froze you no matter what setting you chose, but the main event happened on our last night. My colleague and I were getting ready for a dinner reservation, and a voice came over the loudspeaker to our floor and said, ""Attention please: we have received an activated device. Remain where you are and await further instruction."" This was repeated again, and at that point, we were terrified. An ""activated device"" sounds a lot like a bomb to me, and apparently to everyone on our floor. We all stuck our heads out of our doors to see what other people were doing, and after realizing that our phones and TVs were cut off and elevators",1,1
"Stayed here for 6 nights the first week of November on Honeymoon. The Good: Location:  such a handy location, walking distance to Times Square and the Empire State Building. Tick Tock Diner:  great food, friendly staff.  The Bad: Tiny room; two ""queen size"" beds but these definitely were not as big as the double we have at home.  We could both fit in one of the beds but only if we lay perfectly straight and not curled up.  Given the size of the room, one bed would have been better and room set aside for something else.  As it was, the wardrobe was so small only one suitcase would fit in it, leaving the other case lying out in the corner of the room for the whole time.  No tea/coffee making facility. Tiny, tiny bathroom:  the bathroom was the smallest bathroom I've ever seen.",2,1
"We unfortunately arrived later in the afternoon and only managed to get an extremely small corner room. I'm talking small even by NY standarts. We had barely any space to walk around the room.   The hall ways are run down, the windows poorly fit and barely keep the heat inside the room. Our room was either always too warm (since we had the heater on to compensate for the cold coming in) or too cold (since the cold air would come in through all places). We even had to ask their service to tape one of the bathroom windows. Needless to say, we were on the 20th floor and still needed earplugs to be able to sleep.  The shower is also either too cold or too warm and very sparce. There's barely any space to put stuff down in the bathroom.   There is no room service.  Whoever rated this",2,1
"The street noise level in our room on the 21st floor felt like we were on the sidewalk! Not easy to sleep, in fact impossible on the first night despite being exhausted from traveling across the country. The shower water refused to blend and swung violently from scalding to freezing. Another guest complained their shower never got above tepid. The room was clean and comfortable enough and this old hotel has charm only an older property can provide. But the noise level (due to the building fabric and the poor fit of the windows) together with the horrendous plumbing rule it out for a future visit, despite the reasonable cost. Very disappointing.",2,1
"Staying in New York for business and needed something central. Yes, I know it's New York and yes, I know I'm paying for a convenient location, but the 'iconic' New Yorker was a huge disappointment.  From the tiny rooms, to the tired decor it just felt that they didn't need to bother with a freshen up, because dopey tourists will flock to the admittedly good location and be entranced by the sparkly art-deco lobby.  A hotel with this location should be an experience, and it was, for all the wrong reasons.",2,1
"The first room we were given STUNK like cigarette smoke, after having signed our life away that we wouldn't smoke in the room upon check-in, it was disappointing. We were moved to another room. After having lived in the heart of downtown of a major city, I can say that noise doesn't bother me - but it was INCREDIBLY loud, and we may as well have been sleeping on the street. The bathroom was dreadful. It was circa 1960, with mold in the shower. The bed was hard, and the sheets were very creased, it looked like it had been slept in! The staff were very nice and friendly, but they never remitted a final folio on check-out and we had to chase the hotel for it.",2,1
The location was good (about 10 blocks from Times Square) and right on a subway line.  The room we were given was very outdated and the windows leaked air badly. The staff was all very friendly.,2,1
We stayed here for 4 nights in August. Our first trip To NY! Upon arrival we had to queue for a while to check in - as we expected. When checking in we were told we had to leave a $200 security deposit - not a problem but we would have liked to have been told about this prior to check in. Having to take $200 out of our shopping money was not appreciated! We do not have credit cards so didn't have that option.  When we reached our room I had to say I was quite underwhelmed. The main part of the room was decorated beautifully but was very small. The bed was very comfy to sleep in. When proceeding to look at the bathroom I must say I was quite disappointed. It was like taking a step back in time. It looked very old and the shower/bath was quite grimy. (See pictures) When you looked,2,1
"First room was dirty, wall paper falling off the wall etc. Switch rooms with a better view, in better condition but still dirty. Found a bugs in the curtains.  Not worth the value  My parter and I come to new york every year for our anniversary, and all properties to date have upgraded us, no charge. The new yorker hotel did not. We won't be returning to this hotel and will not recommend it to anyone.",2,1
"If you like small dirty rooms, cramped bathrooms with old fixtures, questionable hot water and poor customer service you should stay at the New Yorker.  I however will not.  Horrible experience, front desk staff rude, mail room staff rude and unorganized.  College students living in the hotel on multiple floors.  The only good thing about this hotel is the mediocre modern gym in the basement, no free weights tho.  I had holes in my sheets, hot water about half the time and the arguably the smallest room in the hotel.",2,1
"First off, check-in for this hotel is at 3:00pm.  My room was not ready until after 5:30pm.  Second, everything above the lobby is about the same quality as a Best Western, with the addition of a lovely ""smells like gym socks"" aroma. I've been through nicer hotels in Vietnam and Cambodia. Third, the staff could really care less if your needs are met as a guest. If you have a question, the answer is ""Ask the hotel manager in the morning"" or ""I don't work here"".  Fourth, the walls were about as paper-thin as you can get. You can hear the person in the next room hanging up their clothes in the closet, it's so bad.  If you want to be kept up by the guy in the room next you watching TV through midnight, and woken up by a bunch of drunk tourists coming back from the bars at 2am, again",1,1
"We put my parents in a room and on the second night they received a notice that the water would be shut off from 11p-5a.  By morning, still no water.  In fact it didn't come on until late afternoon the next day.  They did offer another room to use, just temporarily, but as they are in their late 70s and 80s and have medical issues, this was a huge inconvenience and embarrassment.    When we asked for a refund of the room, they stalled and gave out a couple breakfast coupons.  This wasn't good enough.  We requested again at checkout and was told we'd get 1/2 off the room for one night.  We were expecting better and so we won't return.  Also, we purchased three rooms for three nights and one room was below the category promised and no offer to move.  And one night there was a very",2,1
No hot water in the shower during 7 days. Cockroaches in the room. Misbehavior by hotel management.,1,1
"Stayed here two nights in Sept 2013. The location is the only good thing about it-- if you want to be close to the subway, Penn Station, Madison Square Garden and the theatre. THIS HOTEL IS NOT 4 STARS BECAUSE - no water in room - no mini bar - tiny bathroom-- can't put your toiletries anywhere - sheets feel like sand paper - tiny, tiny room - room doesn't feel clean-- bathroom floor is all grime - noise from air conditioning all night  I would never stay here again and wish I left after the first night.  In summary: a gross, uncomfortable, noisy and unclean room. No way it's 4 star-- if it were 2 with the price 25% of what I paid-- OK",1,1
"Your staff was gracious and helpful.  The hotel rooms were advertised as completely remodeled.  I was surprised at the dingy quality ESP of the bathroom and lack of true remodeling.  I asked if there would be a charge for checking out after only one night and the answer was ""no"" but the charge for the tiny queen room was over $450 for one night.  My husband and I are recently retired and plan to do a lot of traveling.  This hotel will make me think twice about Ramada in the future.  Again, your staff was professional.",2,1
Small rooms. Impossible to get temperature to a comfortable level. (Too hot.) Heating/Cooling unit roared all night. Wifi not working. I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriot-Midtown East the next night. It was superb in every way.,1,1
"Very poor customer service I prepaid before arrival and emailed the hotel several times they never bothered to reply even after trying the guest service manager. ( Ronny Yagual ). Upon check I was told we would be given a better room for our inconvenience, but we got exactly what we had paid for a view room. Small bathroom that needs updating and no space for personal items but admittedly it was clean. Far from being updated as stated but with chipped paint on the doors and in hallway the hotel looked very tired. I found staff unhelpful especially when asking for specific help I had single word answers.  When I came home I have found an additional CHARGE on my credit card and do not know what this is for. I have contacted the hotel again but as usual they cant be bothered to",2,1
"Hot water was not guaranteed...but the showering facilities were not the worst thing about the room.  Our metro room was smaller than a shipping container, and let about as much light in.  With two double beds in there, there was just about enough space to walk to the bathroom.  The window gave a lovely view of the room opposite, and without straining your neck, we had no idea what the weather was like outside.  The room clearly hadn't been redecorated in years, and the paint was peeling off the walls.  Other than that, it was alright!  Our friends, who got a free upgrade, had an excellent room!",2,1
"I would NEVER consider staying here again. They're boasting a remodel, but I'm not sure what they're doing or have done The hotel smells worse than the subways - the stench of mold and urine permeate throughout the building - reminiscent of a convalescent home. For close to $300 a night, to have to travel to another floor for ice is ridiculous.mi wasn't even able to print out a boarding pass at the business center as all the computers were down (but I did very much appreciate the guest services rep who took me to his office and printed one off for me there - he was the ONLY bright spot in my entire stay).

"If you are a frequent 4 star traveler this hotel is not for you. The reservation was made by telephone, i requested a suit on a higher floor with a view, this was noted. On arrival we were given a sad, tired and smelly suite (?) on a lower floor with no specific view. The bathroom was moldy, smelly and the toilet seat chipped. The hairdryer cut out after 30 seconds. There was no complimentary coffee or tea. I mentioned this at the reception and they replied it must have been an oversight. The coffee machine was delivered (dumped on a table) the coffee,tea and plastic cups(yes plastic) was never replenished throughout our stay. Four star prices for a  two star hotel.",2,1
"Last minute pick for a business trip due to office proximity.  Staff was nice and helpful, great way to start my experience.  However, it was the last time during my stay that I was pleased.  The room was extremely small and had dirty walls.  In addition, my bathroom had peeling paint, mold in all the crevices and hair from the previous guest in the shower.  I was mortified!  I also found the bed to be uncomfortable and heard a plethora of street noise even though I was on the 32nd floor.  I had high hopes for this stay and wanted to love it after walking into the deco lobby, but I won't be staying here again.",1,1
"I didn't actually pick this hotel. I got it way below the rack rate on Priceline.com, so maybe I shouldn't complain too much. Nevertheless ...  The best part is the location, as many people have pointed out. If you are planning to sleep in the room and absolutely nothing else, this is probably an adequate choice. If you are planning to sit in the room and, say, read, forget it, because there are no chairs. There are no chairs because there is no room for a chair. The bed basically fills up the entire room, and the bed isn't even a queen-sized bed. It is a standard double bed.  On the plus side, the lobby is very nice and the hotel seems reasonably clean. In New York City, though, you have to go pretty far upscale to get something comparable to a decent motel in much of the",2,1
"This is not a 4 star hotel, it hardly merits 1 star.  We have stayed in far better Bed and Breakfast accommodation. The bedroom had no space to unpack our suitcases or to store them and only a single built in cupboard to hang clothes away and a chest of draws.  There was a dangerous lose electric socket at floor level and the windows were absolutely filthy which prevented you from enjoying the views of New York City from the 31st floor.  The hotel claims to have spent millions on upgrading but it is not clear where this money has been spent. The bathroom was nothing short of shabby! The bathtub had been painted over with a ""renovation"" paint and some but not all of the wall tiles had been painted over whilst other odd mismatched ones had been left.   The staff were in general",2,1
"The staff at the check in desk were beyond rude. After the hotel tried to make changes to our reservation without telling us it took several hours to get them to honor our original agreement. When talking with the manager I overheard a few other guests complaining about various issues and being treated just as poorly as my wife and I had been. The room was great when we finally got it, but the overall experience with the staff will keep me from ever visiting this property again.",1,1

I was told when I went to reception about my room that 'this is what my booking got me' and that the hotel was full.  Well, it got me a tiny room with a very old air conditioner that sounded more like a tractor than anything else and a bathroom that was not only very old but had no working fan.  There is no fridge and that might have been okay if the ice maker on the floor had worked but given the heat and the demand it was on 'melt down'.  The best service came from the cleaners who went out of their way to be helpful and did a great job in trying to make a room that was",1,1

The drinking glasses were plastic which was shocking, considering the amount of money we were paying.  The so called free WiFi was not free at all unless you went down to the lobby and the air conditioning unit was so noisy that we had to turn it off to sleep which then made the room unbearably hot.  I would certainly shop around more next time.",2,1

"I stay at different hotels is New York couple times a year and this time it was The New Yorker hotel.  The hotel is located at the business area; may be convenient for business purposes but it is not a good location for touristic stays. More than that, the standard room was so small that only the bed and the very tiny desk were just fitted. The bathroom was so tiny that you can not move if you don't close the door. The decoration is old and tasteless. Although the staff is friendly, I would not choose this hotel again in NY where for this money you can find better hotels at better places.",2,1

I stated to him that it is a dumb rule especially when we were the only ones being asked for keys. He then told me to shut up. I went to front desk to complain as they basically call me a liar. From there we were scared of letting the maids coming into our room to clean it. Next day we were greeted in the hallway from a maid saying she was told she has to clean our room. We said fine. When we came back to the hotel room our safe was open, and all my credit cards were dug through. When i made a report about this they stood up for their staff and said that it is not possible for maids to access the safe. The maid",1,1
"Booked with Priceline and paid 200$ a night for this hotel. When we got there, we got what they call a ""standard"" room. It was so tiny all it included was a bedroom and a bathroom. The hotel is sooo rundown.. just horrible. There was barely any space to put our luggage. This hotel is NOT a 4 star. I don't know what people consider 4 star, but this Is definitely not it. Yes, the lobby is nice but once you enter the room, it's worse than a motel. I attached some pictures I think they speak for themselves.  Just some things you should know before you book (remember this is suppose to be a ""4 star hotel""): -No minibar -Barely any hot water - if anything, just warm -Shower head is so old when the water hits your body is actually hurts  -Safe is so small, you can't fit a laptop in it",1,1
"My experience with The New Yorker makes me really question other reviewers here.  Yes, it is a good location, convenient to public transportation etc., but there is a lot not to like IMO.   I was here for an event at the Javits Center.  Here is why I am unhappy with this hotel:    - Room is extremely small (okay, it is NYC, but still, WOW!  Your relationship better be in good shape if you are sharing this space.  - My entire room smelled like dirty, locker room feet.  Gross and no where to move me.  - Bathroom had dirty towels left in it, hair all over from the last person and no bathmat.  - When I did finally get a bathmat it had holes and was frayed all over.  Peeling paint in the bathroom and moldy shower was also the opposite of charming.  -Hot water LITERALLY takes over 5",2,1
"A mostly unpleasant experience with blocked up sinks, rude staff on the lobby. My mother was refused access to a disabled toilet even though she is disabled and was about to be sick... They made her go back to her room. When I complained I was told the man at the desk who laughed in my face and said no would have to apologize but he didn't.  Asking for a local hairdresser at the info point I received "" I'm a guy, would would I know, ask a girl"" as a response.   Staff insisted on the amount they wanted to be tipped.  My biggest tip? Don't use this hotel.",2,1
"Having travelled to new york on business, i booked at the new yorker through American Express Travel which advertised the New Yorker as a 4 star hotel. What can go wrong at a 4 star hotel in Manhatten?  A lot.  Having seen the bathroom situation, my wife rightfully refused to unpack. I posted a picture for you to view the moldy bath tub. Would you take a shower in this bath? I showed the photo to the Manager(?) of Housekeping but she averted her eyes. Also, I have seen more luxurious amenities in cheap motels. We called Amex and they arranged that we get a slightly better room. Since we paid in advance (big mistake), we stayed.  The next day we asked for additional blankets. It took them 5 hours and 3-4 calls to deliver.  The glory days of the New Yorker hotel are long gone and",2,1
"This property was the recommended conference hotel for a technology seminar at the Javits Center; although the location was touted as being two blocks from the conference, it was actually ten blocks from the conference site and very inconvenient when raining because cabs could not turn onto the street with the hotel's main entrance.  Upon checking into the hotel, the first room offered was barely larger than the bed - literally, there were 18 inches of space around the full-size bed and a bathroom barely large enough for the commode.  Although larger, the next room reeked of stale cooking odors and grease, and the third room offered had been freshly painted to unsuccessfully mask the permeating odor of nicotine.  i reluctantly chose the second room and gagged for six nights.",1,1
"I've just checked in at the New Yorker and my first impressions are terrible. Ok the room is small, even by NY standards, but the worst is the awful dirty-looking carpet and the cheap bed linen, which doesn't fully cover the mattress.... This is the first time I'm misled by tripadvisor reviews, so wanted to set the record straight.",1,1
This hotel is not 4 star. The lobby is fine but the rooms are not cleaned well.  There were crumbs all over nightstand & carpet when we checked into room. The bathroom has a  layer of dust all around tiles. In the bathtub there is a soap dish that you only notice when you take a bath that was filthy & moldy. All in all rooms are not 4 star. Rooms are more like a cheap motel that needs  to be renovated.   Only good point is location is good. Don't stay here.,1,1
"The lobby of the New Yorker Hotel can lull you into a false sense that the rooms and service would reflect a grand hotel.  Far from the truth.  The room is seriously small, the carpet needs cleaning and as for the bathroom it is so small that you have to keep your toiletries on the nights stand table in the bedroom. Room Service - that is a cruel joke.  I ordered a salad and some soup from room service.  An hour later a gentleman from a local diner showed up with the food in a plastic bag.  Of course everything was in Styrofoam package.  He spoke no English and could not understand that this was already billed to the room. He kept handing me the bill asking for money. I finally decided to pay him, but he would not accept as he had no change and could not communicate in basic",2,1
"Arrived here for a 3 day stay after visiting Las Vegas. Our room was extremely small and dated. We felt like we were staying in a blackpool hotel! The whole hotel is dated apart from the lobby. However, the location is superb, close to central park, empire state building and times square. On our second morning, we asked the information desk for help on how to get to the 9/11 memorial site but were offered no real help at all by an arrogant employee. He is the one who sorts out the transport but clearly didnt want to help us out. The tick tock diner within this hotel is excellent, good food, good choice and qwerky atmosphere. Worth a visit. The cheesecake was amazing!! The weather was not the best, it was raining alot which stopped us from exploring the surrounding area properly",2,1
"Generally dated appearance, horrible diner and mediocre restaurant on ground floor, bathrooms have cracked and, where replaced, mismatching tiles. Every surface has ten layers of paint. Though great location to get around town and rich history - should just be done up and eqipped with a new set of staff!",2,1
"The reception staff were curt and surly but even they were outdone by the bar and waiting staff in the Coopers, some enjoying wine by the paper coffee cupful! I can’t imagine what it would be like trying to get served when it was busy – it was almost impossible to get served when it was quiet.  When I asked for a menu it landed on the table with the grace of a shot up, crippled bomber landing on the deck of an aircraft carrier! The carpet in my room was sticky to walk on – yuk!!  The only positive note were the guys tending to the lifts who were very pleasant and chatty.",2,1
After having poorly slept in another Ramada hotel.  I was looking forward to staying at this once world famous hotel.  Everyone in the world has seen the New Yorker logo which is a symbol of New York.  It was very cold outside in Feb 2013 and it was also cold inside my room in Feb 2013.  The room heater must have been 50 years old or at least it sounded like that.  The room was not a retro from the 30´s it was from the 30´s.  Very spartanic but clean.  The hotel personel were used to people not being happy with the room.  The only positve aspect on this hotel is the location.  I will never stay there again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,2,1
"This hotel is OLD. They have done upgrades, but the carpet still needs to be replaced and the rooms are very small. It was just my husband and I and we were cramped. The main issue we had was cleanliness. We had two rooms while here (the first room was on the ""outside"" of the hotel, over the street, and it was loud. So we asked to move closer inside and they happily obliged. (Great customer service!) However BOTH rooms were dirty. Both rooms has long (female hair) on the pillows (2 in the first room and 1 in the second room) House keeping maybe? But I don't like mystery hair on the pillows I sleep on. Also, in the second room there were two stains on the sheets, it looked like makeup? Once we were settled, everything was ok. We slept well, the location for midtown is good but I",2,1
"First of all...Jhony, the bellman (bag check in guy) is the rudest person working there. He is EXTREMELY demeaning and pompous...I booked 6 rooms for 5 nights each...and paid $400/night per room. You would think I'd get some sort of service here. Then 2 of the rooms had cockroaches in it. The bathrooms were dirty. I do NOT recommend this hotel or advise anyone in their right minds to stay here. Go stay somewhere else!",1,1
Room was dirty and sooo small! There wasn't even enough room for two bedside tables the queen bed has up against a wall so there was one bedside table!! My master bedroom at home was way bigger than the entire room and the bathroom was even worse! The whole place felt dirty had a musky smell and was dim! We stayed on the 27th floor and the whole floor looked rank (dont know if other levels are in better condition?) we payed over $1500 for a 5 night stay and were really disappointed! There is no way on hell the room i stayed in could be rated anymore that 3 stars! the location was great but there were cheaper options in the same area i wish i went with as I was so disappointed with this hotel! The wifi was very slow and to top it all off I found the staff very rude especially the,2,1
"Last we I stayed at The New Yorker, and after seeing pictures of the lobby I was excited and looking forward to staying there for my business trip, although I normally never pay $300 per night for a hotel...On arrival I was in Aw of the beautiful Art Deco lobby, but my excitement quickley went to  distaste when I got my floor and the room....I have closets bigger than that room. We found long black hairs in the shower...and after a long day of air travel I was too tired to deal with it.  The walls a very thin and every time the neighbors turned on the water the sound was extremely loud, and we were woken up every time someone went to the bathroom next door during the night. The next morning, on our way out to a long day of business meetings with ABC, we went to the front desk to",2,1

"I am aware that a four star hotel in the US is certainly not what a four star hotel is (expected to be) in Europe, but still, this hotel certainly looks like a (bad) European three star to be very generous.   The hall looks charming, retro, but our (very small) room on the 21st floor was stale, tired, boring, and not particularly clean. The windows have not been cleaned in ages: very dirty and full of stains, one could barely see what was outside. The windows were so thin and poorly isolated that you could feel a draught. The bathroom was tiny (which is not surprising in hotel in the States); the water in the shower was either very hot or cold. The toilet did not look like it had been disinfected. The bed (queen size) was uncomfortable for two people, but the mattress was good,",2,1
"The hotel was not as nice as expected. Decor, fittings and furnishing old and tired. Room was very small ('Metro' room with queen szed bed). We asked for a larger room, and to be fair to the front-desk staff, they provided a slightly larger room promptly. The bathroom sink didn't drain properly. After two days it blocked completely. We told hotel staff in the morning, then we went out. Got back 5 hours later and they had done nothing. After another hour we were moved to a new room. I appreciate the hotel is in central Manhattan, but based on the price I would expect better. (e.g. It had plastic cups instead of glass, no minibar, no safe, very small rooms, windows don't open, shabby bathroom). On the plus side, the location was very good. It was central manhattan (midtown) and",2,1
"This Hotel was booked for a two night business stay from 4/2/13 to 4/4/13. We suspect that the rooms were very expensive due to Spring Break. We purchased the rooms through Priceline for $300 per night. Outside of Switzerland, we have never paid that much for a a hotel room. At least the Swiss Hotel was a 4-Star hotel. The room we stayed in, was never meant to have a queen size bed in it. The room was probably very similar to the way it was set up in 1930, when the hotel opened. No safe. No refrigerator. No view. Every neighboring faucet could be heard as the water ran through the walls. Although the Lobby has been beautifully restored, the room hallways have not. The lighting is bad, and the place just seems worn down like some of the old hotels in downtown Las Vegas. We did",2,1
"After 1 ok experience at the New Yorker I decided to stay here again. What an awful decision that was. I was given the smallest room possible when asked to change they took me to a room with a blocked toilet, when I informed then about this I was taken to another room, where there was construction work taking place. I ended up staying in my small original room. The only good thing about the hotel is its location. I would not come back to this hotel again.",2,1
"This holiday was sold to me by Barrhead travel as a four star hotel it barely makes 2* in my opinion.  Our first room was tiny, had dirty sheets and a loo which had obviously not been cleaned. When we politely requested another there was not even the hint of an apology. generally the staff are sullen and verge on the rude. The 2nd room was the same size but slightly cleaner although no where near what I would consider 4* standard. This is a period hotel with many original features however the whole place requires a good clean and a decent makeover. On the upside the bed was very comfortable but had no mattress protector, this I'm afraid was the only positive I could come up with.  The hotel has a very good location if you want to be in the heart of New York. Personally I'd",2,1
"We stayed at the New Yorker for a  few days in January. The location of the hotel is excellent. Close to all major attractions, few blocks from the empire state building and opposite Penn station. It was easy to accees any part of the city. The rooms are clean but small, i suppose normal for New York standards but definately small for 2 people. Initially we were given a room that was tiny, we were 2 plus 2 pieces of luggage we could barely fit, plus the bathroom window wouldnt shut properly which at minus 2 can become a problem. We asked to be moved to another room of the same category and the gentleman at the reception booked it for us for the next day given the hotel was full. The next morning we talked to the reception staff and the lady there (Samira) was very unfriendly,",2,1
"This place was fantastic for location, great for convenience right next to Penn Station, so travelling from any airport is great with easy interchanges! However our shopping bags were taken from our room, with complete ignorance from the hotel management since the incident took place...  We stayed over new year, and crammed all sorts in over the days and bought gifts for ourselves and family from the infamous Empire State! We bought goods to quite a high value from there and were looking forward to enjoying them at home. After a day out we noticed these bags were missing from our room, when we reported this to security they dealt with this very well whilst we were there. We were advised the hotel cleaning staff would be questioned and felt very reassured we would be compensated",1,1
"I don't usually leave reviews, but after my experience at The New Yorker, I felt the need to let you know about this place. I booked a room with two other people for a weekend in the city in October. Evidently we booked on a busy weekend, the place was packed! The lobby of the hotel was very nice. The lady at the front desk told me I'd booked a single room. This was not true. I showed her the confirmation on my phone and argued. She just shook her head and insisted I'd booked a single room. No luck with her supervisor. So we spent the weekend squeezed into a tiny, stinky (smelled musty and old) room. The hotel was booked and the front desk folk refused to do anything for us.   We managed to have a good time anyway, and spent as much time away from the hotel as possible. On the",1,1

Thogh I had sent a confirmation 4 days before our arrival, we receved the confirmation two days after our arrival ... Great location but hotel is not a 4 stars hotel standard .",2,1
Does not stack up as a renovated hotel.  Queen rooms are so small that a queen bed won't fit in room; thus queen beds are actually double beds.   Finishings are poor and fittings just the minimum eg there isn't a holder for the single ply toilet paper.  I've asked to be moved to a room based on the specifications I asked for.  Certainly won't recommend this hotel!,1,1

"Just returned from a 4 night stay at the New Yorker occupying a New Yorker room. If you are seeking a hotel for just its location and a base to rest your head (if you can sleep on the bed that is!!!) then this hotel or rather hostel is for you.  The redeeming points are its Dining facilities attached to the Hotel: Tick Tock Diner and Cooper’s Tavern. Other than that I personally found my stay at the New Yorker very disappointing for the following reasons;  • The room was very cold. Despite trying to regulate the room temperature it kept defaulting back to a set one – freezing!!! • There were no coffee/tea and fridge facilities in the room. The first hotel I have stayed in New York without these basic amenities. •There was no room service, though advertised not available – so be",2,1
"I was looking forward to this hotel based on other reports.  But I had a much less satisfying experience than what appears to be the norm.  Room 1905 was small, which was not a problem as I was solo.  What was a problem was the noise coming in from the hall (neighbors departing at 5 am woke me up) and from the adjoining rooms.  I could hear one person (a performer?) singing the scales to warm up his/her voice through the wall.  This was more pleasant than hearing another neighbor singing at the top of his lungs after returning from a bar or club one night.  In the latter situation, I called down to the desk and within 10 minutes I could hear security pounding on the door and then yelling at the guest to be quiet.  The noise stopped.  The room was also drafty, and I could hear",2,1

Stayed at The New Yorker for 3 nights as part of my Honeymoon and from the smart Art-Deco style reception we were expecting a lot from the room. We were apparently 'upgraded' to a disabled access room as they were more spacious. The bedroom was okay but bathroom was dirty with lots of mildew on the tiles the heater was also broken so was freezing. When using the bathroom it wasn't helped by the shower that dribbled out and in 3 nights only managed to have 1 hot shower after running it for around 10-15 minutes as instructed by reception. After coming back frozen from a long day of sight seeing at sub zero temperatures it should of been a basic essential to have heating and hot water.

We had no issues... until  We started noticing our money disappearing, so much so that we had to cancel our holiday, leave goods back that we bought in order to get money, and go home early.

"So let me preface this by saying my trip to New York was smack dab in the middle of hurricane Sandy, I've just now gotten the sour taste out of my mouth from the HORRIBLE and I do mean HORRIBLE management team. To get the reviews of the actual property out of the way I will start by saying that if you are going to New York, Miami, DC or another equally large city is it totally unrealistic to expect an immaculate room. At least for a reasonable rate. And you don't spend your entire time in the room because, hello, you're on vacation. So as long as the room is moderately clean and in a good location I'm generally fine. The location of the hotel is awesome, right in the middle of everything and close to Times Square. The rooms were typical, two beds, small bathroom. For the first",2,1
"This hotel was advertised on Hotwire as a 4-Star option however it definitely is NOT that. The rooms are dated and small. The bathroom is even smaller with zero counter space and insuffucient outlets.  Who designs a bathroom with no countertops????  The shower area is old, small and dated.  This place needs a major facelift.  If you're looking for a true 4-Star, stay elsewhere!  I would not stay there again.",2,1
"Well looking at the pictures of this place it looks very good, and to be fair it's good, I'm just not sure it should be 4star. Once you leave the lobby it goes down hill. The decoration needs to be updated, looking at it it was painted back in the 90's the bathroom tiles were painted lime green and the window had duct tape around it. Great location but a little run down. Reception staff were the most unfriendly people I came across in New York customer service skills need work!",2,1
My stay at the hotel was okay but since I've returned home and have been looking for my security deposit to be back in my account I've gotten the run around.  No one seems to know what is going on and never returns your phone calls.  I wouldn't ever stay there again.,2,1

I voiced my concern to the front desk employee and asked to speak with a manager. I waited for 15 minutes for a manager to come to the phone and then hung up and called back. When I voiced my concern to the manager, african american man, he told me it was my fault that the room was not ready because I had ordered a special request, a roll away bed.

Having a queen size, I can state that it was a double bed, as was the one in the second room we booked which wa also supposed to be a queen.  The rooms are miniscule...even by NY standards! The tick-Tock diner on property was very convenient however.  Not a bed place overall, just that the rooms need complete modernizations (larger!).  They need to be honest about the bed sizes at the very least!  The Grand Hyatt is a better bet.",2,1
"Upon arrival there was a huge check in line over an hour wait. No carriers to help with the luggage at all. No carts to help with bags. Hotel suite was TINY, bathroom was old and in poor condition. The tub was peeling and actually sharp. One of my childrens foot was cut open. I made a complaint. We were there for a dance convention that was held at the hamerstein ballroom. The hotel refused to open the walk thru and all the parents and children had to walk outside all day in the freezing weather to get to the event that was over 3 days. Nice view would be the only good thing",2,1
stayed there for a concert in brooklyn this past september. the hotel is dated. old and not the star level for the reviews on priceline. i have booked the same star level on price line (4 1/2) and stayed at far finer places. the shower was like a garden hose nozzle and not much in the way of renovated since the 80's. the room smelled stale and the sheets were stained when we arrived. wouldn't ever stay there again...,2,1

"Staying at new yorker, it was a total disappointment.  Only positive thing was that the hotel is in center of Manhatten.   Negative things...  1) Inside of the building was very old and 1930's style bathroom. Not at all worth to pay it for 180 dollors per night. It's shame to say that it's 4 stars.   2) Since it was old building, wind came from the window althought we couldn't open it- especially in the bathroom. So we needed to sleep with bathroom door closed. but you can imagine, how freezing it was in the morning.  3) Heater - very noisy but without heater on, very too chilly to sleep.   4) I've never seen any hotel that guest need to pay for their suitcases when they leave them at concierge. 1 bag for 1 dollar. Can you imagine?  I payed 6 dollors for 2 big suitcases, 2 small",1,1
1) Did not stand by price confirmed online registration 2) the night i checked in thursday 12/14/12.

"The room was tiny. Ok, I get that. It's NYC and space is at a premium. And since I was there for business, I wasnt to be in the room much anyway. The bed was HORRIBLE. I work up every morning with a terrible pain in my back and a crick in my neck. The bathroom had what appeared to be chest hair on the wall. Not in the shower where it may be excusable, but on the wall. Overall, for the rate I paid, I was extremely disappointed and will not be returning.",2,1
I booked this hotel on Priceline. It was listed as a 4* hotel and with taxes & fees it was $296/nt. (It was pre-Christmas and a very expensive time in NYC. The hotel was sold-out.)   The lobby was 5*. Wow! I figured this place was going to be fabulous.  The desk clerk was rude and surly.   The room was terribly disappointing. It was tiny--which I would expect for NYC--but it was closer to a 2* room than 4*. Simply nothing attractive or upscale. No coffee or tea in the room. The bathroom was claustrophobic and had no place to put my toiletries.   I'm guessing I gotten one of the worst rooms because of it being through Priceline.   I did like the location & the diner attached to the lobby. But would not stay there again.,2,1
"Yes, this hotel has history. It shows, and not in a good way. The front desk was staffed with people that were less than friendly. The room, which was a ""view"" room was very small but without any European charm (where small is the norm). I had to request a refrigerator for storing medication. A maid wheeled it in a placed it in front of a small dresser (only place near a plug). It meant I could not get to one side of the bed or the small desk, without hopping over it. When I woke up in the morning after barely sleeping on the uncomfortable bed, I found my medication frozen which destroyed it. Not good. I am avoiding this hotel in the future.",2,1
"Huge hotel but when i first walked into my room i thought it was a joke. Bed was barely acceptable for one person, let alone 2. view out of window was a brick wall. I phoned expedia and kicked up such a fuss, that they moved me to the paramount, which was much more acceptable. Diner downstairs was revolting too",2,1
This hotel is wonderfully located...but after that the disappointment begins.  The front desk staff seem as if they are doing you a favor for checking you in.  The rooms are old and the bathrooms are extremely dated. We requested a room with a view.  Our view was looking at other rooms at the hotel.  Not quite what we were expecting.  Management cared very little for our complaints. I will find different accomodations on my next visit.,1,1
"I stayed here from the 16th to the 20th of november. Special occasion for joint birthdays. I have came back to the UK over a week and half now and discovered that they have charged my acct twice and as a result (they pre authorise your whole amount and more on the day you arrive and then charge you the actual amount when you leave!) this has made my mortgage payment bounce today! Are they rectifying it? No! £50 worth of telephone calls, numerous excuses, no call backs. As of now my mortgage will still bounce on monday and I will be charged another £100. so by MOnday I will be £250 down in charges before I even start to get my 1,077 back! Totally disgusted with the hotel and not likely to see this 1,077 back for a very long time... my bank are helpless as they need the hotel to",1,1
"The location is excellent! That’s the only advantage of this hotel. The check-in staff is very cold and there is no greeting.   I want to give an advice to everyone: don’t buy their breakfast package. I paid $10 for the breakfast for each day. When I checked in, the staff gave me coupons (blue-colored) for free continental breakfast in a nearby restaurant Tick Tock Dinner. When I used the coupon in the morning, I just could not believe my eyes. The breakfast only includes one glass of juice, one cup of coffee, and two very small pieces of toast. It’s hardly enough for my three-year old son. The second morning I talked to the front desk staff. The guy was very rude. So I talked to the manager. She said she needs 30 minutes to find out what went wrong. I just don’t want to waste",2,1
"Our family of 4 recently took one of our dream trips - New York City for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.  We booked the New Yorker through Expedia.  The reviews looked good, but we were very disappointed.  At check-in, the hotel staff was disinterested at best, but truly rude.  For the rest of our stay, the service from the concierge, front desk, and travel desk was simply awful. Despite our efforts to be polite, we were continually faced with rude employees who obviously were not interested in us.  The cleaning staff, on the other hand, were friendly and accommodating.  The room was unbearably small with a view of a wall, and the bathroom was worse.  A tiny sink, no counter space and a barely functional shower.  The location was decent, but not great.  We were there for",1,1
"The value proposition of this hotel (rate of room when taking into account cleanliness, amenities, etc) is the worst of any hotel / motel / bed and breakfast I have ever visited.  The carpet was dirty and sticky.   The furniture was dirty and completely worn - the arms of the sofa were worn to the point that the cushions were showing through. My gf and I had to place a sheet over the couch just to feel comfortable enough to sit on it.  I will never stay at another Ramad / Wyndham property again.",1,1
"Good: Subway is right next door, price is competitive. OK: Location is great according to some,but not an area you would come close to under normal circumstances. Bad: Employees are fed-up,lack enthusiasm and are RUDE! Don't ever ask the concierge lady for some advise, you will get your two cents. Horrible: The room! Stayed at hotels in Japan, notorious for small rooms, but none got close to this one. And the furniture, and the bathroom, and the closet, (lack of it), and the dirtiness,.....  Please go anywhere but here...",2,1
"The worst hotel i've ever been. I would prefer the super 8.  The worst service, rude staff, tiny rooms.  I was re-routed 6 times for a corcscrew.  Avoid this place if at all possible.  You will wait in line forever to check in, the staff barely speak English, and I felt like apologizing to the Brits checking in nect to me because it was just embarrasing.",1,1
"Recently stayed one night out of planned three nights at the New Yorker hotel. The room was amazingly small with an even smaller bathroom. In this tiny room was an uncomfortable bed with small out dated pillows.  I'm not sure where the furniture came from but my daughters dorm room has better generic furniture. The bathroom was small, there was no toilet paper holder and the toilet was crammed into the corner.  The shower was old and out dated and the water was Luke warm.  The halls were drab and dingy and reminded me of a hostel rather than a Hotel.  I got very little sleep and checked out the next morning. Went to The Pearl Hotel which was fabulous.",1,1
"The hotel was disappointing, we waited a long time to check in.  Yes we had heard the rooms can be quite small in New York hotels and that is not wrong.  We were disappointed in our room size, had to put our cases n the floor beside bed. Bathroom was so small it was one at a time for using it.  You have to go high to get any decent view.  Rooms and hallways are very rundown and showing their age and it didn't really feel it was clean and we were told it was four star when we booked. Location is good for walking to everything including hop on hop off bus stop. I gt my hand stuck in the No. 2 lift door, I could not pull my hand out for several seconds and my wife hit the call button and it finally reopened, it hurt that much I was yelling and two ladies came to see what the",1,1
"Room is so small that I was initially claustrophobic.  Bathroom is about as small as our toilet at home. Double beds should be outlawed!  Who can get a good night's sleep in a bed so tiny? Staff are indifferent, although concierge was very helpful. No help offered with our 5 bags, no tea & coffee making facilities in room & no food services on site. Location is ok for walking to Times Square & Empire State Building, but not a good area for decent restaurants.  This is not value for money & we would not stay here again.",2,1
"The best that can be said for this Hotel is the location. We arrived at 5.30pm but one of our rooms was still not ready. One room was so tiny we had to play 'traffic lights' around the bed and my husband decided it was smaller then our bathroom at home!!. There was no tea/coffee making facilities...not even room service to supply one, so we had to get up and go to the nearest deli....which was a real disappointment on the morning of my 50th birthday! . We didn't have much interaction with the staff, but was surprised when handing back the key at reception that we weren't even asked if we had enjoyed our stay. The bathrooms were outdated and even more compact then the rooms. Our stay in New York was only 3 nights, so we didn't waste time complaining about the rooms as we didn't",2,1
"I arrived at 1am in the morning, when asking what name the reservation was under 'ronald' mistyped it, he then went on to tell us it hadn't been paid for, he would not look at our paper work and continuously said 'the reservation has not been paid'! Eventually I had enough and forced him to take my passport, he then noticed his typo and went on to say 'oh it's been paid' there was no apology! I was disgusted!!!! I then got up to my room and it was tiny! This was also my honeymoon! VERY DISAPPOINTED! Won't be back!",1,1
"I had high expectations for this once glamorous hotel. The location was great, just a mile from Times Square, lots of shopping in the area, but that is about it. The room was very tiny, the bathroom is dated and our tv didn't work and despite calls to the front desk, it never got fixed. Anytime someone turned on a shower, we heard the pipes rattle and it woke us up. When we checked out, we were waiting for our friend who was also in the hotel, but when he didn't arrive we asked at the front desk and they said he had checked out. It turns out he just slept through his alarm and was still in his room. Glad our stay was just 2 days.",2,1
"The hotel is very efficient for a short stay in NY, especially if NY is not your final destination - close to all attractions, one block away from Penn Station (good if you take Amtrak or just want to go to JFK during rush hour), one block away from Hertz location - but do not expect the quality of The Ritz.    We had a ""View Deluxe Room with Two Double Beds,"" which was reasonably large (around 30 sq.m) and well equipped.  Housekeeping supplied a coffee machine and capsules for both tea and coffee (not Nespresso, more like drip coffeemaker).  The view was good, although a nearby rotten skyscraper spoiled it a bit.  The bathroom was reasonably clean, but the pale green tiles and worn toilet seat lowered overall score.  Housekeeping was somewhat intrusive and kept checking every",2,1
"For $400 per night, you expect a little charm, a little something extra. If you stay here, set your expectations far lower. You will get a room the size of a shoebox with a view of another building and a tiny bathroom that feels like a public school locker.   This hotel is devoid of charm and is simply a place to sleep for a night, nothing more, nothing less. If you want an experience, stay at the Ace Hotel or something similar where the owners actually invested a little time and thought into design.",2,1
"Great location for a hotel, that can't be denied, however a hotel cannot sell itself purely on that. First impression of the building was fantastic, beautiful art deco features, gorgeous public areas. greeting by reception staff was friendly but unhelpful. Our room wasn't ready despite our arriving at the check in time of 3pm. The man on the desk then told us he couldn't give us an estimated time that it would be ready because if he did and we returned and it still wasn't ready it would give us cause for complaint! We were left in limbo with our hand luggage to wander in the local area and get a drink from a local diner after travelling for 19 hours. An hour later room still not ready, then some confusion as he realised this room wasn't going to be cleaned until late evening,",2,1
"I would not step foot in this hotel again due to the terrible customer service.words that discibe the staff: unfriendly, unaproachable, rude, bossy,unhelpfull.the staff in this hotel give me the impression that they hate their jobs.I had a great time in New York however the staff in this hotel did spoil it for me.For this reason I would not rate this hotel.",1,1
I paid extra to upgrade and have a terrace and didn't get the upgrade or the terrace. The rooms are very small; the very low water pressure will keep you in the shower for some time. The small square pillows provided were not sufficient to sleep on; who do you know that sleeps on a square pillow? The only view window has a desk pushed up to it so you can't really look out. Lazy staff with an attitude to boot. I asked the conciere some questions about the hotel light fixtures and she looked at me like I was speaking chinese.,2,1
"Stayed at The New Yorker based on all of the positive reviews and the great location.  I don't know what people were thinking!  This is a total tourist trap.  Sure, it's in a convenient location, but $500 a night for THIS?  No way!  The rooms were not only small, but lacked any sort of amenities.  There was no safe, no refrigerator and, get this -- NO COFFEEMAKER?!  I called to ask where to get coffee the next morning and was told they would send a coffeemaker right up.  Never came.  The bathroom was very outdated.  Oh, and skip the concierge and head over to Cohan's Optical to get your glasses fixed and get some great, friendly recommendations on where to go!",2,1
"We stated st this hotel for one night. Very nice location, esp if you travel by train. However, the room was VERY cold and heating is not on until late October. It toon us several calls to 4 people to get a heater. The rate we paid was about 500 per night... Appear angle heat was extra ;)",1,1
"This hotel may have a bit of history and yes it is a great location but it is not a four star hotel.  The standard rooms are the smallest i have ever seen in any country. The bathrooms are very dated, baths are enamel and chipped and stained. The beds are ok but there is no room for any more than one suitcase and you have to use the very limted floor space. The rooms can not accomadate 2 persons in the same space at one time and there is no fridge, coffee maker or radio.   Sure the hotel is old but to to rate this hotel 4 stars is being dishonest as most travellers expect certain ammneties by star ratings. I didn't choose this hotel as i stayed here by a choosing the secret Expedia deal which i will never do again as it seems ti me that this is one way to get rid of dud hotels",2,1
I have delayed posting this review despite the fact that we stayed at the New Yorker at the beginning of June 2012 because I thought it was fair to allow the hotel to address our various complaints first. We only finally achieved a vaguely satisfactory settlement on 11th September 2012 and only then after the tour operators had become directly involved so I do not feel it at all unreasonable that I should set out in detail the problems we encountered to warn others.  We travelled as a family with two teenage children and stayed there for five nights. My husband is very seriously disabled and we had gone to a lot of trouble to ensure that the room would be suitable for us and would accommodate the hoist he needs to be able to be put into bed and to use the bathroom.  The first,1,1
"...Otherwise, I would skip it. As other reviewers noted, the walls are paper thin (I am there at this moment and the shower from next door is so loud I feel it will leak into my room)!  Similarly a few minutes ago, neighbors on the other side returned to their room and their entry was so loud I wondered for a minute if they were trying to get into mine!  The property, while it appears to be basically clean, is very, very old. Such that in my room, there is a total of 1 electric outlets, which has two sockets, near the floor across from the bed. None in the bathroom. As others noted, also there is an absence of any reasonable shelf space in the bathroom (as in, like zero...), there is no coffee maker, the mini-bar is empty, and when i went to use the safe in the room, there was a",2,1
"Excellent location near Penn Station, close to Time Square. But that's all! Extremely small room, the most uncomfortable pillows I have ever had. Not even enough space to breathe in the toilet. The noise of some toilet flushing can be heard loud in my room. Woke up at 3am with a bunch of drunk girls yelling at the room next to mine. Too small, too old, not worth the price!",1,1
"The New Yorker is a strange beast - you witness a completely outdated exterior, only to enter a somewhat impressive lobby, and lastly make it to a closet of a room. While you obviously have to pay for space in NYC, this hotel really give you the minimum. Add to that some pretty ancient bathrooms, and it feels like you're visiting the greatest city in the world, only 30 years earlier. Keep looking if you can.",2,1
This was a short notice booking and hence was extremely expensive for a one night stay. The reception staff were most unhelpful with one small request that I had. There was no sense that they were going to assist me with it at all.The rooms are clean but are like a shoe box. That's to be expected in big cities but not at the price that I paid for the room. I thought the bathrooms were very dated and common area carpets were old and grimy. I felt ripped off.,2,1
"I stayed at this hotel right after a wonderful time at another New York hotel in walking distance; but I can say that my experience here was the polar opposite at The New Yorker.   When I arrived at the front desk, I was greeted....wait, actually I was waved over by the agent's wiggling index finger. I saw that her name was ""Siemira"" or something like that. She just blurted out ""NAME"". I responded to her question (?). She gave a obvious sigh of frustration, and asked for ID. I passed that on as well, and not once during this excruciating process was I ever welcomed or even acknowledged beyond a barbaric level.   The check in alone was horrid enough that it already defeated my experience. The hallways and rooms kind of look like a low rent apartment building that has not been",1,1
"I am currently staying at this hotel, and i would like to share with you the humiliating experience i had in checking in.  I approached the receptionist, she did not greet me or smile. I started looking for my travel documents and she asked me weather i was a student (quite a weird question since I'm a 30 years old business women). It turns out Expedia misspelled my name, so she could not find it. she asked me when did I make the reservation, and I handed her a printed confirmation. For a few minutes she looked for it, not telling me what's going on just mumbling ""no, no reservation"". At that point i asked to speak to a manager. The manger seemed angry for calling her. she said I was already being taken care off, and I should sit and wait. Finally my reservation was found, again",1,1
"I recently stayed at this hotel with my family because a family member had a business convention within this hotel. We live about 400-500 miles away, and we drove, since it is cheaper than by plane. We arrived at the hotel, got obnoxiously yelled at by the valet man outside for being slightly within the bike lane, and gave our car to him to park. Three days later, we check out. It took 20 minutes just to get our car, and this unusually nice guy (stingy-looking) steps out of the car, assertively puts our bags in the trunk, and stands awkwardly close to the rear end of the car until we get in it. We pay our $105 valet bill ($35 per night/ $45 for minivans (STUPID)), and leave, only to find a dent in our RENTAL car while filling up for gas in Pennsylvania. The bumper was slightly",2,1
"Other than the general locale of the hotel being relatively close to the theatre district and easy access to subway lines, it was a dump. We were appalled at the condition of the room, particularly the bathroom. Paint has peeled off of walls, grime and dirt prevalent along ledges and moldings, grout in shower disgusting... When I complained to the front desk, the apathetic response I got was, ""well, that's the room you booked..."" Are you kidding me? Lesson learned. Never again at this establishment. Only reason I gave cleanliness a 2 is because it was bed bug free.",2,1
"I booked this hotel in March for a July stay for our wedding anniversary. We arrived too early to check in so headed out for some shopping and eats. Upon returning after 3 pm there was a line snaking through the lobby for the check in desk and we waited over an hour only to hear that we had to step aside and wait for the manager. Another 30 minutes later, the manager appears from behind the door to tell us that our room (a Tower suite with balcony) was not ready. No explanation, no offer to relax with a complimentary drink at the bar, no apology. An hour later, I ask again, same answer. An hour later, my husband asks again, same answer. By now I am on the phone cancelling and rearranging our reservations for that night. At 6 pm I can't believe that we are being ignored like this",1,1
"In my experience this is not a 4-stars hotel. Maybe I had bad luck with the room I was assigned, but it was very small, noisy, with a small bathroom w/out ventilation, old, bad painted walls, etc. After one night I cancelled my reservation and moved to another hotel (thanks to hotels.com very good reservation services) for  the same price and a 4-stars room & service.",1,1
"Was in New York City for Dance Educators of America workshops and competition for my daughter.  This was exciting for her, but hell for me.  I did not book with the rooms blocked by DEA so I didnot receive a discount on my room.  The room was very small, felt like I was in a closet.  After speaking with several people they stated that this was the norm for NYC.  Pushing past the smallness of the room I was still quite shocked as there were no amenities (i.e. microwave, refrigerator, coffee maker).  I travel extensively throughtout the United States and abroad and for the money that I spent for these accomodations I definitely was expecting more.  They rate this hotel as 4 stars, I beg to differ.  The walls are paper thin, seeming as though the neighbors who were constantly",2,1
"This is the worst ever hotel I have stayed at in NYC. Visited the hotel in December. The room was very old and extremely cold. Crowded with youngsters - tourists. The building itself - seen from outside has a Nice architecture, but the innsiden is not Nice.",1,1

"My family stayed 7 nights/8 days in this hotel. With regards to the rooms: it is small,dark,old,carpet is dirty and bathrooms are small and old style.Shower is slow and hot water goes from cold to very HOT and back to very cold!! Housekeepers are too thorough with their cleanliness that they ""äccidentally"" threw away my husbands NEW ADIDAS shoes that was inside a shopping bag.We found out that his shoes was gone on the day of our departure while packing.The housekeeper assumed that the shopping bags near the garbage cans were trash and she just took all of those shopping bags away.Investigation is still going on but when housekeeping was asked about this,they denied going inside the room.Very Frustrated!!! The only good thing about this hotel is the Location. It is just a few",2,1
"The location is great but that's about it. The rooms are small and although they recently put in new furniture the bathroom has been untouched. We only had 2 towels and my husband had to go out and ask for extra towels and was asked 4-5 questions by the hotel staff before getting the towels. There was no place to hang our towels so they stayed wet throughout our visit.  I was ""ok"" with the hotel until our last day when the fire alarm went off at 5am. We called the front desk and they told us they were checking with security and would call us back, that's reassuring. Without waiting for our phone call we left our hotel room and there was smoke in the hall and we couldn't use the closest stairs due to even more smoke when we opened the door. It was the scariest thing I've ever",2,1
"Absolutely appalling front desk behavior.  Rooms tiny with hard beds, outdated furniture, tiny TVs. Water pressure weak on higher floors. Run down hallways and slow elevators (can take you up to 10 minutes to get down to the lobby in the mornings). Spotty Internet.  But the unprofessional behavior of the front desk staff really is the real reason to stay away from this place.  Location can be a plus if you need to be around the midtown area, but note that it can get loud if you are staying in a room on a lower floor facing 8th Avenue. The soundproofing on the windows isn't the greatest.  I did tip the housekeeping staff handsomely--felt sorry that they had to work in this mill.",1,1
Just got back from a 6 night stay in this hotel.   PROS:  +Location- great to have Penn Station and shopping so close. +View- If you ask for a higher floor facing east (Empire State Building) the view is amazing.  +Gift Shop- Very reasonable prices +Free breakfast- Nice to be able to grab something quick and free before running out for the day. The view from the 39th floor breakfast area was a perfect beginning to the morning. The gentleman who runs the breakfast area was one of the nicest people in the hotel  CONS: -Shoebox size room. One tiny window with a desk in front of it makes it difficult to enjoy the view.  -Disgustingly old tiny bathroom. The water wouldn't stay the right temperature. No vanity to place more than a few things. -AND WORST OF ALL- The entire family woke,2,1
1 - I arrive at the hotel - The super rude staff asks for 300$ security deposit - Never mentioned to me while I was booking the hotel.  2 - The receptionist rudely suggest me to leave the hotel if I really want that money.  3 - The rooms are contemporary! In a bad way. The bathrooms are from the 1950s and are unclean.   I request you - Please DON'T try the hotel!,1,1
"I was there for a meeting and the Security personnel in the lobby was asking every one entering the elevators "" where are you going "" hmmm.. that was a bit off putting but, the area around the Hotel seems a bit rough so, i guess it's a necessary evil.  Anyway, this was either Tuesday 6/5/12 or Thursday 6/7/12  around 1:pm because, i had meetings on both those days.. well, i had the audacity to ask where the restrooms were and the well dressed Security gave me a lingering, angry look and gave me a Key, didn't look at me and just looked straight ahead and told me ( rather annoyed ) downstairs, to your right and when i returned and tried to give him back the key he told me "" just put it on the desk "" .. its hard to describe but, unfriendly, annoyed, irritated and angry come to",1,1
"Very noisy, major construction going on at MSG kept us awake most of the night.  No hot water for all evening, they gave us a breakfast voucher to make up for it, but the breakfast at Tic Toc Diner was bad - half done French Toast and weak coffee.  Lots of bums in the area I guess because of the train station.  Very small room, fine for 1 person but too small for a couple.  Not recommended.",2,1
"We chose the hotel for its location - which is excellent - and it's architectural style  - the lobby is magnificent - and that for me is where the positives end.  Nobody greeted us to see if we needed assistance with luggage; the check-in staff were rude and we were left to find our own way to our rooms.  The room was tiny with a double bed, only one bedside table as there wasn't room for two, a tiny wardrobe that wasn't deep enough for a hanger and nowhere to put luggage.  The brochure we chose from misled us into believing that the rooms have safes and fridges - they don't.  The bathroom was tiny and shabby and, whilst the fittings were clean, the tiles and paintwork were not and it really needs serious updating with its chipped and peeling paint and stained floors.  It was",1,1

"Well 1 night over now and a disaster of a first night, used the toilet last night at 2am and it flooded the bathroom when flushed. Complained at reception dis-morning and the guest service lady didn't seem too concerned about it and said she would put another room on hold and to call back in an hour or two. Terrible guest service, but I will add that I was dealing with a different guest service lady, Ruth yesterday who was lovely.",1,1
"The location is great! but the staffs are terrible. It does not seem that English language proficiency is required to be a front desk staffs. The staffs do not seem to know how to great guests. They are even rude. The price paid for the hotel versus the customer services is unfair.  The hotel room is very small in square foot. The bathroom is old, dirty and very narrow space.  This hotel is terrible when I am staying here right now. It might be because I am unlucky that very non-professional employees are assign to work.   I feel like getting my luggage and escape to another hotel or even a small motel. After all this terrible customer service, the great location is no longer important for me.",1,1
"I've been booked in here by my business travel implant at $200 per night and it is not good value. The room is tiny, tatty and very dated. Air con is rattling and no secondary glazing in the room. There is absolutely no refreshment in the room - free or paid for. No mini bar, tea or coffee facilities or even water - only tap water. Wifi drops out more than it is on and the desk have no international plug adapters to lend out, even with a deposit. The security is questionable. Anyone can walk straight off the street up to the upper floors. A security guard is in the lobby but has not questioned anyone approaching the lifts and given that the first 10 floors are student and rented accommodation it doesn't feel like a hotel. When I complained at reception the first question was",1,1
"We were attending a conference at the javits center. So this was a great location, walkable. However we were immediately met by a very rude person at the check in counter. When we finally get checked in our room was so small it barely fit the completely uncomfortable bed. On a good note the pillows were great. The shower and sink had hair in it. The worst part of our stay was at 11pm they started taping up the floor in the hallway. Talking very loud by 4am I had called downstairs 2 times. To be fair I did complain the front desk manager in the morning and they refunded half our room rate. I would not stay here again.",2,1
This hotel is very old even though It claims to be renovated. In my experience the rooms were very small and noisy. I experienced lots of road noise as well as noise from adjacent rooms. This led to poor sleep. The walls are very thin I could hear people showering in adjacent rooms or even watching tv plus there was lots of noise just from opening and closing doors.   In the shower setting a consistent water temperate is impossible.  It's either too hot or too cold and changes constantly.   Location is fine for day sight seeing just do not go out alone late at night. It does not feel like that safe of a neighborhood after dark.,2,1
"We stayed in the New Yorker for 7 nights for a vacation in March.  I will start with the positives - the location of the hotel is good being just a few blocks from Macy's and the Empire State building. It is also next to Penn station so convenient for getting the Skytrain to JFK. The Tick Tock diner and Coopers Tavern restaurant we're both excellent with good food and friendly staff. I also couldn't complain about the maid service - staff were friendly and the room was always thoroughly cleaned.  Unfortunately, the negatives of the hotel far outweigh the positives. Upon check-in we had our first of many bad experiences with the front desk staff. We were ignored for several minutes despite several staff appearing to be free. Once we were served we not made to feel welcome, we're",2,1
"Even though I made a booking online it still took at least 20 minutes (after queuing for 1/2hour) to get checked in.  The location around the hotel although in vicinity of Javit centre (about 15 minutes brisk walk) was a bit rundown, but it is close to a big station so that is expected.  The hotel was really nice but in a foregone era, now it needs refurbishment and upgrades.    Don't include breakfast in your rate it is horrible, fatty and in a Route 66 restaurant open 24hrs (not sure when the clean) everything was always sticky!  The rooms was really small, even though we took one with a view (you could see the river if you checked carefully) so we upgraded to a bigger one which is more expensive but really just looking into other buildings.  The hotel is impersonal, big and",2,1
"The location is great, no doubt about that. But that can't be the only sales argument for a hotel. The rooms are extremely minimalistic and they haven't been updated in ages, everything feels very old. We were in constant need for more space to store clothing/bags. The staff is not really that helpful in our experience. One good thing - the free WiFi is up to par with expectations.  We will not go there again, but will probably go with the NYMA hotel which is in a similar price range and location. When we booked this hotel, we thought we would get a better deal than NYMA.",2,1
"I stayed here for six nights and found the hotel staff were very rude and impolite, the rooms were very small and either freezing or roasting, the shower was very bad, the pressure of the water kept dropping from hot to cold and it was very uncomfortable, the cleaners made a lot of noise in the morning time, but on the plus side the hotel is conveniently located but that's about it, I would not stay here again!",2,1
"Small clean rooms, only in part renovated. Clean but old bathrooms and bad maintenance, we had holes in the walls and pips were rusty. Better rooms on higher floors. Excellent location 5 minutes walking from Times Square and Empire State Building. Near by are Macy's , Madison Square Garden, Central post office.

"This hotel was a real dissapointment, considering the high ranking on this website! I found that staff were unfriendly and not willing to help. I was trying to find a laundromat and the gentlemen at the front desk explained how to get there, however I was nervous about getting lost and asked if he could draw me a map. He said it was too easy to get to, so he wouldn't draw one. I ended up walking in the wrong direction and it took me 5 minutes of wandering around in the rain to find it. When we were checking out, I found the lady at the front desk to be rude. She talked to me as if I was stupid, didn't give me clear instructions when I wanted to empty my safe deposit box and left me feeling quite embarrased. During our stay one of the two bathrooms in our room was leaking to",2,1
"If this is a four star it must have been in the 1970's brown decor, dingy rooms. Paid for queen redecorated room but got a double not sure what was decorated about it, maybe the awful quilted and padded headboard.  If that wasn't bad enough got into bed and found blood on the sheets (have taken a picture).  So tired and disappointed with the attitude from the reservation desk that for the first time ever dd not complain, thought these words would speak louder.  Would rate this a 2/3star hotel at 4 star price.  Tired and in need of brightening up including some staff.  Spent last night at the W also 4 star no comparison if you have a choice stay there instead.",1,1
"Well, I had stayed at the New Yorker a few times before on business in previous years and maybe I've been spoiled by other places with better accommodations since then, but this is the last time I will ever consider staying at the New Yorker. The hotel has a great local on 8th avenue, close to action etc, but it's noisy b/c of that. We checked in early and were able to get to our room early, however, around 10pm at night when back in the room (mind you i travel here on business), we kept hearing a noise by our room that sounded like the freight or laundry elevator starting and stopping. So i call the front desk and ask them if this is a temporary noise that shuts off after a certain hour and they said yes after 11pm! this noise lasted ALL Night Long!  I could not believe that a",2,1
"I believe this hotels star rating needs to be taken down to 2 stars.  When my boyfriend and I arrived, the lobby was nice and the valet service was impressive, however, when we got into the room there was hold chicken nuggets on the floor, hair on the shower wall, and make up on our towels.  The room was TINY!  I mean I have stayed in New York several times and this room has been the smallest.  The bathroom resembles an old dorm, not a hotel room bathroom.  They really need to be updated.  Especially if they are being advertised as a 4 star hotel!!!  The shower did not work correctly.  A single, hard stream came out of the shower head. I did use the hotwire name your own price so maybe that is why my room was so terrible (because I had paid a discounted price).  The service was",2,1
"I must admit I entered the reception lounge  into this hotel expecting to receive a fantastic welcome to New York and the woman who booked us into our two rooms was very surly and snappy (maybe she was having a bad day but hey, she should not work with the public) Any way we booked in and decided to do the typical tourist visits. I must admit we saw all sorts of life I  which was an eye opener. We then decided that we would like to visit the 9/11memorial and visited the site. When there, they informed us tickets were required. We asked how to get these as we did not have access to a computer, they informed us the hotel booking booth would do this for us. The lady at our booth in the New Yorker was very unhelpful, she told us to do it ourself on the Internet in the basement, we",2,1
"stayed there in january...the room was either freezing or boiling hot.  the thermostat would kick in at icy temps and would not shut off until it was smoking in there, no matter what we did!  worse than that?  the bathroom was so cold you could see your breath in the air...it had a large window that was frosted and let in so much cold air it was freezing in there!!!  asked for a heater and was told no way.  small, tiny, freezing room....ughhhhh!",1,1
"I was really disappointed with my stay at the New Yorker. I was placed on the 20th floor next to a bunch of 30-something males having a party. They were loud from 8pm till 5am in the morning. Security was called twice (10pm and 3am) and we complained twice in person at front desk.   Their suggestion was to call the police. I didn't want to disturb their fun and only wanted to be moved to a quieter floor, next to the flight attendants. I had 3.5hours of sleep in total.   The decor is really nice, small and cozy. Wifi is really slow. I rented a movie on iTunes and it was going to take 3,600 hours to download. They didn't include soundproofing in their newly renovated rooms so if you value sleep, don't book there. You can hear simple conversations through the walls from another",2,1
"Upon arrival it looks fabulous, location is brilliant check in was rubbish, customer service course obviously not undertaken, not at all helpful. We wern't ""shown"" to our rooms even though a bell boy service is available, we had to ask where the lifts are, the room was very clean & smelling nice, although very small, enough space for a bed & to walk around, en-suite bathroom a little dated although again very clean. We decided to see a show & went through the conceirge at the hotel, we were offered 2 tickets at a really good price which we purchased, the conceirge stated these were the last 2 available & we had to pick them up before 18:00hrs, which we went down at 17:55hrs to do & was told they hadn't arrived, however the conceirge gave us an address to go & pick them up, which",2,1

"I have very mixed feelings about this hotel. And they are more negative than positive. As many travelers pointed out, the location is absolutely great. But so is the location of many other hotels in the area. We thought that the hotel was absolutely not worth the money we paid.   It all started when we arrived. The lobby was full of people with loads of luggage and there was a very long line in front of the reception. Unfortunately we got the other receptionist (there were only two). The guy was rather snappy and slow.   During our five-day stay we never had a comfortable feeling in the hotel lobby. The were always people sitting on bags and luggage laying around, almost like the main hall of Grand Central...   Our room was rather OK. Not too small and being a corner room it had",2,1

"We encountered one sullen front desk staff named Ana during check in, though the rest of the staff seem friendly. Extremely cramped, small room with seriously outdated furniture. When I booked the room, Expedia clearly indicated that it would be  a renovated queen room, but there was nothing remotely resembling renovation anywhere in the room. I just don't see how anyone can, in reasonable conscience, assign a 4 star rating to this miserable, mediocre place. The Tick Tock Diner was every bit as miserable - the hostess directed us to a table in the corner where the waiting staff were banging away in the very next table replenishing ketchup, salt, sugar containers. Of course we moved to another table, over the objection of our surly waiter, very quickly. This is truly a miserable",1,1
"my girlfriend and I stayed one night in the New Yorker Hotel.  Given the majority of good comments and the great location, we though we'd enjoy the stay.  When we arrived it took us almost half an hour to check in. No staff member seemed to care about the situation and not a word of apology for the wait.  The room was smaller than a shoe box and the small window was opening on a very close wall.  The carpet was worn and there was a smell of tobacco in the corridor that went into our room on several occasions.  The room was noisy and it was common to hear the neighbors.   The cherry on the cake was to be asked to pay for them to keep our luggage even though we could have kept our room longer.  The manager refused to hear anything and his best response was ""it's only a few bucks"".",1,1
"I stayed at the New Yorker Hotel the weekend of the 11th and checked out the next day. Although we only stayed there for a day, it was one of the worst experiences that Ive had EVER!!  I am in the hospitality industry and know all the bad things and delays that could happen, but the problem here was not the hotel but the people working there. They were rude and when we asked questions about directions, they would say that it wasn't their job to find that out for us. Also during check in, they said that we cancelled our reservation when we clearly didn't and after around half an hour of saying we did not cancel, she finally ""found"" it.  I have been to several hotels in new York and only stayed here because if the closeness to the Javits Center that my convention was at. But never",1,1
"Positive: good enough location, double room was quite large, pleasant enough staff  Negatives: I think, especially at these prices, that there simply was not enough value. Staff certainly never went above and beyond, everything (internet, bottled water, gym) was an extra cost. The decor was not nice and quite fussy and dated. The restaurants in the hotel are not worth trying either. There are much better values in nyc.",2,1
"I stayed at The New Yorker for 4 nights at the end of november 2011 with my best friend.  The location is good, not too far from Times Square. The room was small, and the bathroom tiny but both of them were very clean so that was enjoyable.Concerning the shower, we struggled to regulate the temperature.  When we arrived at the reception, the check-in took ages and we've been kind of told of because my friend booked it under her company's name.. Then, the front desk agent told us 'You booked the cheapest room so it is very small.If you pay 50 dollars a night more per person, I can make you happy and give you a bigger room' We replied that we were ok with the size of the room and were not willing to pay more for another room. He insisted again 'I can make you happy, I want to make",2,1
"Stayed at the New Yorker over Thanksgiving week.  Was pleased to be able to get an early check-in...until we got to the room.  The bathroom was rusty and very small.  The bedspread had dried on who knows what the hell it was and the bed was as comfortable as pavement.  I can deal with a small bathroom and I threw the bedspread on the floor, but I cannot sleep on an insanely hard mattress for four nights.  I stopped at the front desk to inquire about possibly moving to a different room with a hopefully more comfortable bed.  The rude front desk clerk laughed at me and said that ""all beds in that type of room are the same, and that no she would not allow me to try another room.""  Later in the day I stopped down again and spoke to another clerk who was just as rude, but at I was",2,1

I booked a Room at 4 star Hotel, not a noisy , closet sized, widow bed room. Stay away of this is Hotel...",2,1
"I stayed at the New Yorker 2 weeks ago, and as an industry professional I was disgusted! The service was terrible! Front desk agents were RUDE and were blaming us for making mistakes! Anytime I I would ask a question to any employee I would get a short and curt response. It was terrible, I will never stay here again because the great location will never make up for the TERRIBLE customer service.",1,1
"My husband and I stayed here for two nights to attend a basketball game at Madison Square Garden after taking the train from DC where we started our vacation.  The location was amazing and had no complaints about our room.  However, as we were packing up to leave I noticed that my backpack felt very light.  I had brought my work laptop with me in case something came up that I needed to take care of, but had not needed it so it was never taken out of my backpack.  When I looked it my backpack, I was shocked to see it missing.  After thoroughly searching our room, I called down to the front desk to report it missing.  The front desk manager and security personnel came to our room to search themselves and question us.  I understand that it is probably common for people to misplace",2,1
"I recently stayed at the New Yorkers this past weekend while attending a conference at the Jacob Javits Center. I was appalled by the service my group and I encountered from check in to check out. First, our six rooms were not ready upon check in And were told that three of our room reservations had been lost. This created a huge problem for us as we had to change quickly for another appointment. 28 people changing in one room is physically not possible. We continued to experience problems when they started assigning credit cards to rooms. They did not follow our provided room list. This caused problems later on when our group members needed to get keys. We had several people who were turned away at the elevators because they were not on the hotels room list. This was because",1,1
Will never go again. I'm embarrassed that I took my guests there.,1,1
"Let me start by saying that I rarely give 2 star reviews and I have never given just one star but what happened to us at this hotel leaves me no choice.  Let me start by the positives... and the only reason that they have one star: the location and the size of the rooms.  The hotel is positioned in a great location that is walking distance to Time Square and the rooms are a good size.  The decor is a bit tired but not bad- a nice art deco feel.  So... if you never had to deal with the staff, this would be a fine option.  But you do.  Not one employee was polite or smiling.  Some of the rooms in our group weren't ready until 5 pm.  They messed up our reservations so poorly that one name was on every reservation despite our attempts to remedy this which meant that when three of us",1,1
"Centrally located next to Madison Square Gardens and the art deco lobby is pretty spectacular but it just sets you up for a bigger disappointment when you get out of the lift and walk along a dark, dingy corridor with flickering lights and peeling paint.  Our room was the tiniest I've seen, smaller than student halls even and was well in need of a revamp. Out of the 3 stops on our honeymoon, this was the only hotel that didn't do anything to acknowledge it and generally the staff were very harsh & abrupt.",2,1
"Very difficult to find many positives - staff were brusque and unhelpful especially when I asked if they had a wheelchair as I had a bout of sciatica while I was there. The rooms were very small and cramped and a bit tired and had a view of a brick wall, but were clean. The room staff were the only people I found to be pleasant - reception staff should go on a course!! This was our first visit to NYC and we were disappointed at the level of service we received - maybe we were just unlucky. Would not recommend.",2,1
"We booked a basic room for 2 - turned out to be a 2x2 cell block!! There was a double (not queen) bed and less then one metre one side and 20cm the other side. Horrible and cramped! Uncomfortable hard bed! The staff were rude and unhelpfull! We had changed our flights and needed longer accomodation, we asked about extending our stay, the lady at reception just gave us attitude and told us it aS going to be a rediculous $$, so we changed hotels.The view was ok. The bathrooms were cramped and moldy! Location is ok but on busy road with lotsa traffic.",1,1
"My cousin and I booked into room 28 on the 29th floor on Sunday 18/9/11, having looked forward to our first visit to New York for months.  Having had a long day travelling (and finding the shuttle bus from Newark airport to the hotel- which proved a challenge and took over an hour) we decided to have an early night before enjoying the sights of the city the next day...and were asleep early.  Imagine our horror at being woken up at 10.00 p.m. by a man's voice yelling from the corridor that 'Security would break down the door if we didn't open up immediately, and the fine for smoking marijuana was $250, and $500 if we denied the offence'....It took a moment for us to wake up and listen to this tirade from outside our door..so we phoned down to the hotel lobby to report this",1,1
"This place is a dump and the title says it all.  The carpets are disgusting, the bathrooms haven't been remodeled - they basically replaced outdated tile with outdated tile and cut corners left and right to make the place look presentable.  The staff made no effort to be friendly or make us feel comfortable.  I had to stay at the New Yorker because my company got a block of rooms at a good price - shocker.  If you have a choice, don't stay here.  If you are unfortunate enough to book a room here, keep everything off the floor and furniture.  I stored everything I could on hangars in the closet.  It's definitely one of the most disgusting hotels I stayed at in NY in this price range.",2,1

"Stayed at the New Yorker, June 2011 for 10 nights, Service was ok, didn't like the fact that i had to leave $300 at reception on checking in, got it back when we checked out though. The room was way too small, couldnt swing a cat in there, our view were other rooms windows and the t.v channels are the worst ive ever experienced, I'm no novice to NY and have stayed in cheaper hotels and got more channels to watch, Tick Tock Diner is way over priced. I was bitten twice on my ankles while in bed, wasn't impressed, I would say the ONLY good point is the Location is perfect, Plus there are way too much bums in that area begging, overall if i was to return, I would think twice in staying here!!!!!!",2,1
"Words do not describe how awful this hotel is. Primarily the service and to boot, dirty, old rooms! Lady at front desk so horrifically rude- and when I asked to talk to the manager, he was no better. Took 20 mins for 3 people to figure out for to check a box behind re front desk. I won't give all the details because discussing the inefficiency and, quite frankly, the stupidity of this hotel staff could take all night.  Dirty, old rooms to boot- bathroom looks like a public bathroom.... Cant wait to check out!!!",1,1
"I'm really writing this with mixed feelings and will try to be a objective as I can.  My family and I stayed here the Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday during Hurricane Irene's visit.  We booked through Travelocity or Expedia (can't remember) and got a fairly good rate of $199 per night. First, the location. Very, very good.  Walking distance from Times Square, Broadway Shows, great restaurants, etc. - really can't beat the location. Check in went fairly quickly and was charged extra (believe it was $25 but could have been $50)when we asked for 2 double beds instead of the 1 King bed (there were 3 of us, my husband and my teenage son). Got a room on the 21st floor and first impression was that 1921 was the last time any updating had been done to this floor. Room was about the",2,1

But after  getting the elevator (which creaked and groaned!)the corridoor was while not dirty, shabby , not smelling well and the decor was very very poor as was the lighting.The rooms were fairly small , apparently we had a master bed (yeah right!),they were poorly decorated ,musty smell, just generally a very poor hotel room.We have stayed in New York on 5 other occasions so we were no strangers to NY.I definitely would not recommend this hotel to anyone.The location of the hotel is very central in Manhatten with good shopping,food and pubs very nearby. My verdict ? a poor hotel which is not cheap and I wont be back there.",2,1
"In the last stop of our family trip (more than 20 days and stayed in over 15 hotels, from Hilton/Sheraton to Comfort Inn, so I can compare these hotels subjectively), we stayed at New Yorker hotel for 2 nights. I wanted to treat my parents with a comfortable stay and good service from the famous New Yorker hotel before they leave (I live locally), but the result was a huge disappointment.  Here are the key points:  pro: good location, near Penn Station and other attractions in downtown  con:  1. extremely tiny room, bed facing the bathroom with noise and smell gone out easily 2. no lock on the door of bathroom which is just ridiculous 3. constant machine like noise from outside or upstairs (not sure of the origin) and from hallway 4. water get hot or cold suddenly in shower 5.",1,1

The man at reception was very unhelpful and not very pleasant. He told us we had been given two double rooms, although we had asked for two twin rooms a the time of booking. I pointed out to him that this would be innappropriate as it could be some way looked upon as incestuous if my 20 yr old son was to share a bed with either his mother, gran or 16 yr old sister. His attitude was one of he couldnt care less. In the end we had to pay a further $140 to get a different room. On checkout we had the same unfriendly greeting. On a positive note, i like the secuity you need to go through to",2,1

This hotel was advertised as a 4-star hotel but it was definitely not one.  The lobby was unmemorable. We had to go through the security in order to use the elevators. The bathroom in our room needed a renovation and the list goes on. More than the hotel, I am disappointed with Expedia for advertising this hotel on their site as a 4-star.",2,1
I got back from staying in this cramped hotel last week for 5 nights. It was soo noisy all I could hear were doors slamming at all hours of the night and people talking outside my door and the elevator noises all night long.

So my guest who stays in his hotel are not his guest? and we spent over 5k to staying here!  2.

Look up the map and u'll see what I mean.  It was awful for: 1. Housekeeping who wouldn't stop ringing the doorbell from 8am. This was despite a 'do not disturb' sign being placed on the door knob.  They insisted that they have to start cleaning the room by 10am because they have a tight schedule everyday! Otherwise, they will not have time to do it. They did this throughout our stay. And because of point #1 above, the problem was not solved. Did I say the front desk was not helpful as well? 3. Tiny room. Enough floor space for only 1 luggage with minimal walking space. 4.

"Had very high expectations of this landmark hotel but was really wrong apart for the lovely lady on the reception who was great, I know when you go to new York to expect small rooms but this was beyond small we had a double bed with no room what so ever to store our 2 suitcases we had to lay them on the floor which stopped us from walking around the bed. So I had to climb over my wife to get in and out of bed but I must say the bed was comfortable.

"Thinking its proximity to Penn Station was an advantage, this hotel was chosen.  Two beds were required, but the room was so small that the two beds left no room to walk around or accommodate two suitcases. When asked to move to a more manageable room, was informed none was available.  There was one minuscule window and scant light.  The  lobby was chaotic, and the staff treated the guests with indifference and impatience.  Overall, an unsatisfactory experience.",2,1
"The location is fantastic - across from Penn Station, and just 2 minutes' walk to the shops on 34th Street, including Macy's. The hotel lobby is gorgeous, so I was very disappointed to find out that the rooms didn't quite match the expectations the lobby created, especially since I stayed at a cheaper and theoretically inferior hotel in NYC just a few weeks before, and found that experience to be better .  The room I stayed in on the 32nd floor was quite small, and the carpet seemed somewhat dirty, which prompted me to walk around my room in shoes only. I could also hear the people in the adjacent room through the night, which is never good for your sleep. Regarding the bathroom, it was in keeping with the overall size of the room: small. In addition, the showercurtain was a bit",2,1
"The New Yorker was a nice hotel in a touristy part of town but I will not stay there again for a few reasons: 1. Money was stolen from my pants laying on the ground and the New Yorker did nothing about except offer me a free night on my next multi-night stay.  I would have rather had my $40 back instead of having to spend more money on a hotel that won't admit fault to recoup my losses.  You would think they would credit me $40 after spending almost $1,400 on the room 2. The location is good with regards to getting around but the area has all the touristy shops that you can find in any mall in the US. We were hoping for a better area with more unique stores. We were mislead by the ""fashion ave"" location.  Although the Macy's is very cool ""Miracle on 34th st"" location. 3. The",2,1
We decided for the New Yorker because of the positive reviews on Tripadvisor and because of its closeness to Penn station. We arrived at 11pm and we had to stay in line for check in for about 20 minutes. After that the kitchen of the restaurant was closed and we could only have food at a connected diner open 24/7 (where they served me expired beer).  The room was newly renewed but very small. I also did not appreciated that every time coming in the hotel to my room I was asked by security to show the room key as if I was some kind of skunk.,2,1
"A group of 9 of young professional ladies checked into this hotel on May 19 for my friends birthday trip. We arrived early and had the hotel hold our bags, they told us to return in 2 hours and that rooms would be ready. We gave them an extra hour, returning in 3 hours and was told that our rooms were not ready and that we would be on all different floors after we had specifically requested being on the same floor next to each other in our reservations months prior. The assistant manager Rowan Beckford was extremely rude, told lies, and left the desk never to return and address the problem again. We waited over an hour in the lobby trying to get this mess sorted out, meanwhile another group from London arrived and were immediately upgraded after their rooms were not ready. Hmmm",1,1

very well located hotel but I was very unhappy with my experience. Unfortunately 2 newly purchased Guess handbags were taken from my room and despite been advised that I would receive correspondence re same from hotel security nothing was done or checked out to my knowledge.,2,1
I would not recomend this hotel unless travelling alone as our room was far to small for a couple and our friends were the same. Bath room small also. There was nowhere to put anything  .I expect if we paid more it would be a different story.We have all been in many hotels over the years and this was probably the worst for space. The only plus was it is very central. Thank goodness it was only for 4 nights.,2,1
"Awful doesn't do it justice.  Small, smelly rooms, nasty area.  Never, ever, again...",1,1
"We were never told about the 300 dollar security deposit it doesn't say anywhere about it on their website.. They would not accept cash for deposit had to be credit card . They were rude and weren't any help at all.. The room was tiny , bathroom was like a box and the tv was in the corner at the side which meant your all body was twisted trying to see it . The rooms were never cleaned properly . Location was perfect right beside the subway station , Macy's , empire state and restaurants.  I would only stay in the hotel again because of its location. I found the staff rude and not helpful",1,1
"I stayed April 16th 2011, without looking at reviews. We left this morning with bed bug bites everywhere. Location and service is fine but I obviously would not return because they are most definitely infested. Also, the shower was scorching hot and the only way to fix it was to shut the hot water off completely but that may have been an issue only in the room I  stayed in.",2,1
"I do not get it ; why should we tolerate bad service and stinky rooms in NYC if we don´t have to do it other big metropolitals of the globe? I ended up paying something like 150 €/ night for s single room in this hotel. The room was book throught my travel agency. TOO EXPENSIVE! You´ll find better hotels for a better deals in the Internet!! Check  tripadvisor! This hotel is in a wierd neighbourhood- if you are planning to spend time in Penn Station or Macy´s, this location is OK, otherwise there is no reason why you´d stay in this hotel. I avoided the reception, bell boys & services - I felt like I was a burden to them even if asking a simple question. In check- in , the man in reception told me ( I had made a polite request via email) he would give me a great room with a view",1,1
This is the third time I have stayed at this hotel. It is close to where I have to go for business meetings so that locatin keeps my coming back but no more. I keep hoping it will be better. The room is small but that is okay if it is clean and efficient. But that is not the case. The bathroom is so small I could barely fit and the hot water was not consistent. I had a meeting booked in the Wall Street Suite. Don't do it. The second floor is falling apart and looks like it will fall down around you at any minute. I tried to call the front desk a number of times and never was able to get through. The best thing about this place is the greasy spoon (and I mean greasy spoon!!) this is open next door. Don't stay here!!!!,1,1
"The hotel was overall ok. It was clean but the service was not very good. For the price and location, it was a good deal. The reason I gave it a poor rating was that I promptly called after noticing I was missing my cashmere pants and no one wanted to help me. I spoke with housekeeping several times and they never returned my call. I finally called to file a report with security and I was told they would return my call and I am still waiting. I was never offered compensation for the pants mising from my room. I was planning on staying in December 2011 to take my mom for a girls weekend but their lack of honesty and service changed my mind.",2,1
"Within 5 minutes of checking in to my room, I found a bed bug hiding under a pillow. This place is registered on the bed bug registry so I was cautious when checking in. I immediately requested another room and was transferred into another comparable room. No upgrade, no discount, just another room. I'd recommend not staying here unless you have lots of $$$ to possibly eradicate bed bugs from your home. BEWARE, BED BUGS ARE PRICEY!!",2,1
"Hi, This hotel has severe issues with the quality of their service. First of all, we had to wait 45 minutes to be able to check in. And there many others behind us who probably waited over an hour. Two polite ladies in reception tried to manage all visitors without any help.   I tried to ask help from the gentlemen in the information desk (who had nothing to do) but nothing happened. Finally I requested to speak to Manager on duty. Information desk guy asked where I will be. Well, I am standing in that long queue in front of you, dear sir!  Manager on duty never showed his/her face or called. This tells a lot about how this hotel treats its Customers (rooms are not that cheap).  Please, try the Hilton hotel on 34th street. It has even better location. Next time I will be there",1,1
Stayed in the New Yorker between dates 12th - 17th December 2010.  Booked a Queen metro room and was allocated a room on 23rd floor.  The rooms are really small but adequate and clean.  The bed seemed really tiny not sure if it was really a queen size more like a double.  Could hear a little traffic noise but was fully expecting this as in New York it wasn't load enough to disturb our sleep after long days sight seeing  The reception is nice enough and receptionist staff on arrival were really helpful and checked us in really quickly.  Lots of lifts to the rooms didn't have to wait long at all.  Concierge was busy at all times it seemed and you had to wait in a very long line to be seen.  We gave up after a 20 min wait & 3 people still to be seen in front of us!!  Hotel located,2,1
"Wow. What a dump.   I stayed here in the winter and was excited about staying at such a landmark place. Upon arrival, it took us 2 hours to get checked in. yes. 2 hours.  I got to my room and turned the light on and got a huge electric shock - it actually made sparks fly! I coudl see daylight between the aircon/heater and the outside - it was a window unit type. So, needless to say, it was very cold and drafty.  The springs on the bed also gave me electric shocks every time I rolled over in bed and I wasn't able to sleep well. I think this was because of the static bedsread (very synthetic) and the awful carpet.  No hairdryer.  I cried on my first night in this hotel and would never, ever return.  If you're considering staying here, don't.",1,1
"the hotel itself has been remodeled and looks great.  the location in the evening becomes a little shady.  Our biggest problem came when we had c hecked out and  realized that several items of clothing had been left in the closet,   We called the hotel immediately, everyone was questioned but the clothes had mysteriously disappeared. The management stuck with the staff and treated me like I had imagined leaving the clothes there.  If the staff will be dishonest about this, it is not a place i want to stay.  With so many options in New York, I won't be back.",1,1
"The New Yorker is a hotel with a chequered history, and it shows. The hotel itself was refurbished a few years ago and although the rooms are small, they are neat and clean with decent ensuites, multichannel flat screen TVs and decent beds and bedding. The area is good, with Macy's only a few minutes walk, along with the Empire State Building and Pennsylvania Station. The Tick Tock diner in the hotel is 24hrs and is good for an American (i.e. enormous) breakfast, reasonably priced.  However the staff leave much to be desired. I did not know that one must leave money on the bed to ensure that the room is cleaned (tipping cleaning staff is unheard of at home) and the first day my room was left untouched. I was told about tipping and so the next day I put two dollars on the",2,1
they were totally booked when we arrived and they put us in a room that they knew was noisy. it was near the elevator mechnical closet and it sounded like someone dropped a bowling ball every time someone hit the elevator button and this when on all night and the night manager said there was nothing that could be cone to fix the situation  so i complain to tyhe day manager andd he said they would make us an offer by e-mail within one hour --i never heard form him  so my conclusion is they had our money and could care less about the customer,1,1
"We booked a standard room through the hotel's website for 5 nights.  The confirmation said ""slightly larger room"".  Our room was tiny, barely big enough for a queen bed, and looked nothing like the picture of a standard room.  The bathroom was not big enough for two people to stand in.  The shower leaked, and after letting the water run for 10 minutes, was barely hot enough for a shower.  The bath products looked like something purchased at the dollar store.  No ESPN on the tv, and the bed was hard with scratchy sheets.  For this we paid $300/night.  The final insult was when I asked if I could stay in the room for an extra hour, I was told there would be an extra charge.  I know there are much nicer hotels in the Penn Station area, for less money.",1,1
"The room is way too dirty and worn out to justify the price, even in NYC. The bathroom has dirt on the floor,  mold in the bathroom, and hairs on the tub and they are not mine. The bed is worn out and uncomfortable and the room has a strange odor.",1,1
"With regards to the other reviews, I dont really agree. You can get so much better in New York for the same price. So all those reviews of ""brilliant"" and ""excellent place"" and ""the best location"",... I just don't really understand.  The hotel is Art Deco, now, I personally find this positive if has been renovated since that period, which I am not sure the New Yorker has. The corridors are dark, its all made in a wrong-brown colour, every wall and corner is chipped, bumped or otherwise has marks of heavy use. Paint is falling of the elevator doors, the furniture is tired looking, and I could go on and on. Furthermore, the corridors are not well lit. All these things make this place look like a sad place. Its not a positive feeling you get in this hotel. It looks a bit like some",2,1
"Judging from this hotel's size and the number of reviews, the Ramada New Yorker hosts a lot of visitors.  Based on our experience, it hosts not just the two legged kind.    One morning, my wife received a bug bite while getting dressed, that turned into a large blister.  A doctor diagnosed it as a brown spider bite.  Two nights later, she received a second bug bite on her foot while lying in bed, that was not nearly as severe as the first.   The only consideration the hotel provided us was to move us to another room and appologize for the inconvenience.  The manager told me that he had the room checked and ""found no infestation"".  He also took the position that that my wife could have been bitten outside the hotel.  Ramada customer service seemed sympathetic, but only referred",1,1
"The room was the size of a toilet!  The staff were not friendly at all!  The room consisted of a bed, TV and small bathroom.  If you wanted tea or coffee in your room you had to ring down, then you would only get one serving!  The only plus for this hotel is that the location wasn't bad!",2,1
"Having booked this trip with a reputable travel company my elderly parents-in-law were assured that the hotel was fabulous, with luxury rooms, excellent views and a convenient location.  We duly arrived for our 6 night stay with high expectations. Our trip was  to celebrate a 50th birthday, an 80th birthday and a 55 year wedding anniversary, so a pretty special visit, of which staff were fully aware.  While it is certainly not obligatory to do so, not one member of staff acknowledged our 3 major family celebrations.  Having being booked in we were given room keys and headed off to the 22nd floor.  Upon entering our room we were confronted by a tiny room overlooking a brick wall, with tired and dated decor, virtually no closet space and a functional (though clean) bathroom.",2,1
"My partner and I just spent 5 days at the New Yorker in New York City.  The trip was booked through Expedia.ca.  The hotel was a great location but it was the smallest room you could ever imagine even for New York standards.  You had to crawl over the bed to get in on one side and the bathroom could really be updated.  It looked like circa 1970.  I called the front desk to see if an upgrade was possible and the clerk said ""well lady you get what you pay for"".  The staff on the front desk were the least helpful I have ever encountered.  The best thing about this was at least it was clean and close to lots of things.",2,1
"At checking in, we got this guy ,,named ( Mohammnd)..would not even look up at us,,,just kept asking for our ID's..When I said we are here spending money,,could you at least look at us...he still didn't.. all he said was that all the questions were company policy,,so I said how come everybody else at the counter had name tags and he didn't? Still didnt not answer us,,Now, I was born in this country I am sure he was not...but he treated us like second class citizens...I reminded him we and everybody I know could spend our money elsewhere..then maybe he would not have his falsh uppidy job..Not a good way to start  a few days Vac.   We were on the 36th floor, tried to get a quiet room, and it was except for the the housekeepers in the morning about 7:30 /8:am.,,,slamming doors,",2,1
"Reserved two rooms and after waiting over an hour to check in was told only one room was ready.  Told desk I do not want to wait in line again for the 2nd room and the lady just shrugged her shoulders.  Key card for the one room did not work, so it was back downstairs to get security to help.  6 hours later I got the second room only to find that the key card once again did not work and in fact the room was already occupied!  Security staff were very friendly but front desk staff were the worst I have ever encountered.  Spend a few more dollars and stay elsewhere, unless you want to waste half your day with this nonsense.",1,1
"I stayed in many hotels in NYC, and New Yorker is simply disappointing.  Huge chaotic hotel with several groups staying in.  Location is good, the rooms are better sized than some more modern hotels, cannot say any other positive things about New Yorker.  Everything is so uninspired and dated, design is absent, service is not good at all.  I got the reservation through Hotwire, but even with fairly good rate is not a great value.  There is only one hotel in NYC I truly enjoyed: Fashion 26, but if you prefer something more traditional, even Roosevelt is better than New Yorker.",2,1
They were ABSOLUTELY terrible to my guests and thought that friends who were hispanic were loitering! It was so awkward and they are horrible. I would not recommend this place to anyone because of how rude the staff was. They almost got physical with my harmless friend. I cannot believe how terrible they are.,1,1
"good reasonably priced hotel.  staff helpful BUT DO NOT LEAVE ANY THING eg shopping in your room, always lock it in  your suitcase. I had some presents stolen , About $150 worth, only small things which would not be missed until you came to pack Our room was locked at all times. The items were not things which you would put in a safe deposit box. The hotel has not bothered to respond to my complaint.",1,1
"First the good things - the hotel is in a great position and has two good restaurants.  Now the grumbles.   Like another reviewer we found our room unbearable hot. The janitor came and turned the heating down but then the most awful banging noise stopped us from sleeping.  This time we were moved to one of their ""newly refurbished suites""  What a laugh.   Slopping some paint over tiles and putting in some hideous and large furniture is not my idea of refurbishment.    Why didnt they spend more money on updating the central heating.  The wiring in this place is frightening with exposed wires just stapled to the wall(see picture) which I suppose is an improvement  on having wiring just loose on the floor. I have no idea how this place passed building regulations.Great shame what",2,1
"We're not usually a budget travellers, but booked one night at this hotel because of an arrival in NYC one day earlier than planned. We had to wait one night untill we continued to our destination.  The hotel had notified before booking that there were some contruction going on and that's fair and decent. It was noticable in the lobby that they were redecorating. By the time this review is written the renovation may be finished. Anyway this didn't bother us too much for the one night we were staying.  We arrived quite late in the evening and upon check-in we were upgraded to a suite on the 42nd floor. At first glance the suite looked very nice. The bathroom were nice and clean. The room seemed to be of the newly renovated ones. We are very grateful for the very nice and",2,1
"Come on people, this is no 3.5 star hotel.  How in the world could anyone recommend this hotel?  From the moment we arrived (2 rooms, my wife and two teenage kids), the service ranged from disinterested to downright rude.  The rooms are old and outdated, not to mention tiny, and the showers don't work.  One second scalding and the next second freezing.  There was mold all over one of our bathrooms and the other looked like it was last remodeled when Kennedy was President.  After two nights of regretting our decision to stay, looking forward to leaving, they then lost our car!  It took them 1.5 hours to find it, lost in the valet.  I missed a very important meeting.  No apololgies, just excuses followed by demanding payment for unacceptable service.  I travel to New York",1,1
"- Started off with arrogant staff at the reception. They were too busy for the ""pestering"" customers. If only they were left alone behind their mighty desks! - WiFi in the hotel is non existent - Each time they tell me its down for a little while - will be fine tomorrow. I have visited the hotel on multiple occasions - my room NEVER had WiFi - had to come down to the lobby near the front door to do my WiFi work! - Has a diner attached - Food is GREAT!! but service is the pits!! Staff think they are doing you a favor by allowing you in.....(a couple of the waiters/waitrsses were very polite but the majority acted like you are intruding into their quiet holiday). The only way to attract the attention of one of those waiters is probably to fire off a couple of ""distress flares""!!!",2,1
We stayed in this hotel In January 2010 and it was one of my worst NY hotel experiences and we go to NY regularly. The rooms very very tiny and you could not go to the other side of the bed without walking sideways. It has been renovated but the hallways still look bad and the room doors are chipped and scratched.  The shower was hard to control and the water was either too hot or too cold.   There is no concept of customer service. My husband arrived with our reservation and I went to a show.  Because the reservation was in my name they would not give him a room and made him sit for 3 hours until I arrived. When I expressed how disappointed I was there was no attempt at service recovery.  If you want to be treated like a tourist and not a guest then maybe you will be OK there.,1,1
"I am completely BAFFLED by all of the positive reviews.  The New Yorker is an old hotel that recently had a (low budget) renovation (or better said, a ""cheaply renovated historic hotel."") Their web site photos are deceiving. It's not as large and not as nice as they web pics show. At $105/night (Priceline) we get what we paid for. The Priceline room they put us in what THE SMALLEST NYC hotel room I've seen (and I stay in Manhattan a lot.) (See pic with person barely able to fit between head of bead and the dresser.) Had to pay an upgrade fee to get what I considered a more standard room larger than a closet. So Priceliners BEWARE!! They will squeeze you into the crappiest room available and you'll have to beg for something more liveable. Complaints aside, this is a hotel with a",1,1
"My wife and I stayed at the New Yorker for 3  nights over the Thanksgiving Day break. We are not people who complain or whinge like everyone who normally writes negative reviews on these sites, however this is a truthful review of a very average experience. New Yorkers are notorious for being ruder than most Americans, this could not be exemplified more in the hotel. Upon ckeck in you will not be greeted with a smile, rather a frown and a ""why are you here"" attitude. If you actually make it into your room as it is the size of a shoebox with shoes inside, you will find it resembling a cell from Alcatraz Island. Want a cold drink after a long day of sightseeing? Well you are out of luck as the room won't have a bar fridge. .  If you take a visit to the business centre you can",1,1
"I am writing this review whilst staying at this tired and poorly renovated hotel. We left some cookies in a sealed bag only to find them opened with mice or rat droppings everywhere. Having been moved rooms we were not apologised too nor were we offered a refund and instead we were told as we have had the benefit of the room (mice infested or not) we could not have a refund. Poor service, poor management, shocking cleanliness if you can have mice up on the 32nd floor! Do not make the same mistake we did by booking this dump of a hotel.",1,1
"Do not stay at this hotel.  It is absolutely filthy.  I travel at least once a month and stay at a variety of hotels and this is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at.  We are non-smokers and the room smelled of cigarette smoke as did the entire hotel.  The halls were filthy, the lobby constantly smelled like nail polish and the service was terrible.  We were put into a tiny room and when the smoke started to come in we asked to switch.  The unpolite staff then switched us to a room with two tiny beds, big enough to only sleep one person so as a couple we were forced to sleep in separate beds.  When asked for a larger bed they said no.  We immediately checked out and switched hotels for the remainder of our stay.  The reason this hotel is cheap is because they obviously",1,1
"I just spent two nights (of three prepaid nights) at The New Yorker Hotel in Manhattan. Considering the price people probably wonder why leave early. Well, I entered my room after checking in and was a little disappointed with the size but oh well it's Manhattan. What I didn't expect was to share my room with the largest cockroach I've ever seen in my life.  I immediately called housekeeping, and after hearing that I had a cockroach in my room, the housekeeping manager herself came upstairs and they of course moved me into another room. While she was very friendly I still cut my stay as short as possible and would never stay there again. Cockroaches don't travel alone - where there is one, there are many.

Very strange young man ( I didn't get a name!!!!) asked me a number of questions regarding the condition of the bag, moved our room. Upgraded, thats a joke the room was 2x2 with a bathroom thats shelf is maybe 2 inches wide and some crappy breakfast ( I don't even think the mouse would eat it and thats why it ate our chocolates and pretzels )  We probably would have been okay with it had it been handled diffrently, it was almost as if we were bothering the managers by bringing this to",1,1

A bunch of dodgy people lounging about the lobby. Location was good. rest was poor",1,1
"We didn't expect that the room booked with Priceline will have only one queen bed. We wanted to check if this matter could be somehow solved with the manager. But the manager at the hotel, Mr.Rowan Bechford, was arrogant, unfriendly and impolite. When I tried to explain him the situation he didn't want to listen to me, interrupted me for several times, not letting me complete my phrase and his facial expression showed total disdain and uppity. Another guy at the reception desk out of the blue started to make fun out of my sun glasses, making unpleasant jokes and comments. I don't allow such familiriaties with people whom I meet for the first time. I am not the US citizen and my English isn't flawless.

I stood in line for 5 mintues and there were two men at the desk, one with a guest and the other just stood their and neither one greeted me. Then when one was finally ready to assist me he summons me with a waive. I was like wow this is interesting especially since his name tag read Delworth Assing, Assistant Front Office Manager. Thourghout the check-in I attempted to engage him with questions, but he was just rude. Then before handing me the keys he tells me ""oh by the way  you may have a problem with your room,"" I then inquire what kind of problem?

"This may be a legendary hotel, but I do not think that it has kept up with the times. Its main assets are its ideal location right outside a subway station and a very good diner that is attached to the hotel.   Unfortunately Ramada Group's ""recently renovated"" rooms do no service the claim the hotel is ready for the modern era. While the rooms were clean, there was no tea service, no kettle (you can very slowly get a pitifully small coffeemaker on request), no fridge or minibar. Essentially you were paying hefty amounts for an extremely basic room, without breakfast, in a central location. I would recommend this hotel on the basis of location-location-location for people who need to get to Broadway shows on foot (a 15 min walk) or to the Port Authority Bus Terminal (10min walk).",2,1

And TWO cockroaches were found in our room, which is definitly not a good sign for cleanliness! The diner was alright, the food was average, the coffee tasted of water and the staff were quite intimidating and abrupt!

Everyone we met in New York was very nice and very helpful when we were a little lost.  We loved New York.  However, the room we stayed in was too small.  We stayed in a two room family suite but the rooms were tiny.  And most importantly the beds were by far the most uncomfortable I've ever slept on.  The whole family agreed.  For that reason alone I would not stay there again.",2,1
"I stayed at the New Yorker Hotel in March '09. The hotel had obviously just been remodeled. The lobby, the bar and especially my room were very nice, clean and attractive. Unfortunately the bathroom left a lot to be desired. It's an old hotel so the crusted bathroom window and layers of paint I could live with. The fixtures were new so that was a plus too. The BIG negative was the water. In the shower the water switched from scalding to freezing multiple times. I would have thought there was a law against that kind of old school plumbing. I don't remember an experience like that since I was a kid yelling from the shower ""Who's using the water! I'm in the shower"". Needless to say I will avoid the New Yorker until I hear the plumbing has been upgraded.  -Bob [--]",2,1

The problems with the hotel:  the quality of the Staff is not uniform,  some lack basic good manners . Lack of room service is a ""down"" and  lack of restaurant (the only one adjacent is not part of the hotel) whose food goes from the atrocious to the banal (unless you like only fast food).

I stay in hotels all over.  My preference is Marriott but I decided to try something new.  The New Yorker seemed to have good reviews at a decent price for NY.  I took two steps from the door and there was my bed.  When I complained they stated that it was because I used Expedia.  Finally they offered me another room at an extra cost.  They gave me 2 options and let me see them first.  They were all the same size!!!! The only difference is that one room had two beds but it didn't feel any bigger.  The hotel could be great.   It has atmosphere and location but the staff and rooms are below adequate.,1,1

When we phoned down to reception to tell them we were unhappy with the acomodation, we were told by the  staff that this was 'our problem' and that we could not be moved from the room.

I called the front desk and was informed they could not send up aspirin or any other head ache medicine, but could call 911.  After much pleading, they still refused to send any medicine to her room ""she should walk across the street and buy it herself"".  I kid you not.  Even though she was in too much pain to make a call herself, their solution was to call 911 or have her leave the hotel to buy her own medicine.    It gets worse.

After styaing in some ""Boutique "" hotels in New York, where the rooms are very small I was expecting a larger sized room, however the rooms are very small as are the bathrorooms.

Staff not very efficient on the front desk. Didn't get a fax  until, the folowing day, even though I questioned the flashing message button on my phone!!

Please note the hotel has few facilities for guest use ie Tick Tock Diner is off the street as is bar and you cannot charge to your room. Returning to hotel just before departure to find ladies toilet in basement locked shut as was facility on third floor and que for toilet in Tick Tock Diner my wife was not pleased.

When I got to my tiny room, with a bathroom that had no place to even put a toothbrush and black hairs in the tub (not kidding!), I realized that the temp was freezing and that the heater was broken. It took three telephone calls just to get someone to show up! On my first day in NYC, I found myself waiting in a freezing room for two hours for the heater to be fixed. Fed up with waiting, I was shown two dark, grim rooms as possible replacements and decided to stay put (at least the room had three windows). I thought the heater was fixed, but to my",1,1
"We have stayed at this hotel  on the night of Oct. 9th - 2 rooms 2 couples.   The staff at the front-desk was very rude and impolite to us. Especially Tony (eve. shift at 4:00 pm) and one of the girls who sent me to do my laundry on the 9th Ave. while there is a coin laundry in the hotel (which I have found out only the next morning while checking out).   Tony spoke in a tone which made us feel we are not welcome at all, he said it was our fault when upon check in he asked us whether we wish the rooms to be together and we answered - yes. Then he said the rooms were not ready and made us wait without telling us that they do have rooms ready but not together. After one of us made a scene, he refused to talk to the men at all. Whenever we turned our back - we felt that the staff",1,1
"I stayed two weeks in the hotel for a business trip.  The check in was fairly easy, the lobby is now under construction but still went rather smoothly.  This was my second stay in the hotel, this time the room was a bit larger than the last one.  Problems with the hotel:  Problematic wireless internet during stay, hot water is almost nonexistant - watch it when taking a shower.  Hot one minute, followed by ice water, followed by just right - repeat.  Coin Laundry downstairs from the lobby according to the signs, and the first security guard that let me in when my card wouldn't work.  Tried to do another load a few nights later to find that the laundry is for students only - the hotel is part of the Educations Housing Services it turns out, and the laundry that is publicly listed",2,1
"We stayed in the New Yorker for a week.  The hotel was fine, if a bit basic, but the rooms were a good size for new york.    The rooms however do not have safes and on our last day we discovered that $120 which we had put to one side in the bottom of our suitcase in the closet had been taken along with an empty travellers cheques wallet.  We reported it and was sent to three different people - none of whom explained what would be done and what action would be taken.  We were told to come back at 3.00pm (we were leaving at 3.30pm) as process would take 30 minutes.  We came back and spoke to the security desk and they started to take our details again.  Nothing had been done and no details had been logged.  We again spoke to three people, the final person being the customer",2,1
"Fabulous location as previously stated and the renovations are coming along nicely, stayed in a renovated room and it was clean, tidy and sufficient for our one night stay.  However the Ramada seems to have upgraded its rooms and downgraded its customer service, the receptionist who checked us in was down-right rude and even asked us if we understood english (we're British) and when taking payment for the room managed to make an error and 'maxed out' our card.    This fact didnt seem to concern her in the slightest and informed us, as it was there mistake they would sort it out but it would be 7 working days before we saw  the funds returned - now with another week's holiday ahead of us this did not go down so well, as it was the majority of the spending money.  Tried to",2,1
"My wife and I stayed in room 3303 ('Metro Room - 1 Queen') for four nights in the middle of our honeymoon. The New Yorker is still undergoing renovation and the reception wasn't finished but our room and everything else on our floor was. The room was tiny, there was barely enough room to put two suitcases down, but then this is New York. Everything worked. the air con was good, there was a flat screen TV on the wall (which wasn't straight!) and it was as clean as anywhere else I've been. There is a launderette in the basement but don't rely on it! There were 10 washing machines, 8 worked. There were 5 dryers, 1 worked! There was one laudry powder machine and it didn't work! The diner downstairs (the tick tock) is excellent, especially for breakfast, and the location of this",2,1
the worst hotel i have stayed in a while the room sizes was 15 by 8  i no i could not belive my eyes when the door opened u could not swing a cat  in the room.it was drity and old we were on the 28 floor  i will never never go back to this place.my suitecase was bigger...,2,1
"Overall, it's an OK hotel. The room was nice, if a little small, and the television was massive. The problem was the bathroom - it looked as if it had not been updated in 20 years! The shower was not great.  The foyer was also a bit shabby, and the reception staff were not that helpful.  We tried to organise a transfer to the airport (early morning flight) and I'm sure the security guard just called one of his relatives, as he came in an unmarked car, instead of a proper taxi service, like we had asked for. He charged the same amount as the taxi service so we weren't too bothered.  Overall, not a great stay, but no major problems. Good location.",2,1
"I had to make a business trip to New York and my company  booked me in this hotel as it was the only one with rooms available at the last moment.  It was a terrible experience. There was construction going on all over the hotel and the lobby was worse than a train station with hordes of gawking tourists sitting around at all times. They even had two staffers checking room keys before letting you take the elevator.   The hotel had musty, faded carpets and the room was small and desperately needed an upgrade.  Will not recommend for anyone.",1,1
"The only nice thing about the New Yorker was the hotel lobby. Once you get past the glamorous lobby it pretty much turns into a run down motel. I rented a suite, for about $200 a night, the room was a pretty big size. Unfortunately, the size had no relation to the quality of the room. The sheets were clean, but the comforter was old and had holes in it. The carpet had about 5 to 6 decent sized stains along with a couple iron burns. The room came with 2 couches, both had red stains on them. I really hope they decide to renovate their property because it is not what I expected out of a hotel in New York City.",2,1
"I needed to stay at this hotel for a conference. It was the kind of place where you didn't want to touch anything because of the filth. The carpet felt greasy. The bed sheets had holes in them. The bathroom surfaces were sticky. I know they are going through some renovation and I can understand if the carpet or drape styles are out of date, but the sheets need to be clean and not full of holes.   Another pet peeve: when the television is turned on, it always defaults to the hotel channel that set to be extremely loud. I could hear it being turned on in all the rooms around me, all hours of the night. Not very good for sleep.   There are better hotels in Manhattan for the same money.",2,1
"I have stayed in NY many times at various hotels.  In my opinion, this is expensive, for what you get, even in New York.  They are updating this  hotel, so maybe in by 2008 it will be different, but right now expect dirty, two star hotel.  It is decently located.  Stay here only if you have an appreciation for a historical hotel which hasn't been updated in decades.",1,1
"The New Yorker was to put it simply, a shabby experience. From the outside signs with paint peeling to the interior old and grubby carpets. The lobby was impressive with beautiful decor, if you ignore the carpets and slightly dated chairs.   The reception staff were too busy to be friendly, but were helpful...cleaning crew were always polite and friendly, as was the doorman. Rooms were always cleaned to a high standard, but no Tea/coffee facilities was inconvenient at best. Room was tiny with a view of opposite building and very very noisy! Heating system made terrible racket and air con system (at 28 floors up), let in all the street noise.  Luggage storage upon departing should be avoided as it seems to be a chaotic and tedious process.  This cost 1398 euro for 4 nights.",2,1
"I went to New York City for the first time last april.  When we first arrived from Boston on the train we arrived and the hotel looked great from the outside, but as we checked in and were taken into the room we were incredibly disappointed.  Our room was very unclean, and some broken glass was in the bathroom, there were exposed cracks and chipped paint all over the walls.  There were also many stains on the carpet and the room absolutly REEKED of cigarette smoke, the walls were also very thin, you could hear all the cars outside all night, and there wasn't much of a view.  Unless you just want a short, cheap stay, I wouldn't recommend staying here.",2,1
"From the minute we arrived things started to go wrong. The doorman was rude and abrupt, the reception staff were barely better.   I loved the location, couldn't have been in a better spot, but my daughter and I kept getting electric shocks every time we touched metal in our room. The rooms were small, cramped and grotty and in everywhere but the public areas the carpets were torn, threadbare and faded.  Would recommend for the location but that's all I would recommend it for.  Oh, and the 'complimentary' breakfast didn't even fill my four year old up. But the views from the 'eating' area on the 40 something floor were nice. As I said, nice location, but.....",2,1
Small rooms..fairly clean...old and outdates decor good hot water pressure...very very noisy!!!  We could hear everything.  The walls and doors do not stop a sound.  Since NYC has so many different people on different time schedules someone is alwasy coming and going or watching TV etc...Believe this place is noisy.  We were only in hte room to sleep and it still irritated me.  It was a cheap room at a cheap price..The concierge was very helpful. My wife and I were not miserable but we will not stay here again. If you want a cheap room andcould care less about noise go for it.,2,1
"Not bad for the location and the price, but if you're expecting a huge room, you're not going to get it.  The room I stayed in was TINY! The washroom was pathetic as well.  The sink was useless; I don't understand how anyone can wash their face in their sinks, much less wash their hands or even brush their teeth! The towels they provide you are paper-thin and non-absorbant - I suggest you bring your own.  I do believe my floor was recently renovated b/c it looked that way.  However, my friends were staying in the same hotel on a different floor and the floor and their room was disgusting. The floor smelled of mould and so did their room.  I can't really complain about the accomodations b/c I was barely in the room; I was only there to sleep.   The good points of the hotel?:",2,1
"From the moment I arrived with my family, the whole thing went badly.  First of all, the Towers at the New Yorker is really just the Ramada.  Standing on a busy NY City street with our luggage, we were looking for a sign that said ""Towers"" but found none.  It is just the New Yorker.  Ramada, New Yorker and Towers is the same place with many names.    The website described the rooms as: ""a superior family suite includes 2 doubles, 1 twin, marble bathroom with hair dryer and phone.  All are beautifully decorated for luxurious comfort. You'll enjoy all the amenities a fine hotel can offer including fax machines wet bar refrigerator coffee maker and a selection of coffees and teas irons and ironing board 2 line phones and data ports.""

Booked a suite at the Towers at the New Yorker through expedia. It was meant to have a double room and a room with 2 single beds. On arrival found that Towers at the New Yorker is the same hotel as the Ramada Inn New Yorker and were told that no such rooms exist. We actually had a room with two double beds in it and a room with a sofa bed. Not ideal as we were staying a week. The kids got to share a sofa bed as there was no alternative. There were no tea or coffee making facilities either. On the plus side the views were stunning. I could see the empire state building and the Crysler building whilst laying in bed!  Macys was a block away and Madison Sq Garden almost next door! The hotel included complimentary continental breakfast which we weren't expecting. This was served in a,2,1
"I am doubtful about their security - definitely the Japanese harassment was perfectly implemented in the way that they get more supports with less spend than victims paying the fee for deteriorated services only to serve the Japanese harassment groups. Else, it was fine. A YMCA facility. Something you can imagine for YMCA guest accommodations would be all set and ready to welcome you.",1,1
"I've taken a reservation for 1 person , 8-11 January 2022.  On Jan 2nd I was involved in a major car accident in the USA and immediately I've sent the cancellation, offering to send the Hospital and Police reports .

"The chemicals they use to clean around the pool are toxic. (I don't know about the rooms, but They use the toxic chemicals when members are still swimming. This is a Health Hazard. Require and pay staff to stay later so they can use the toxic chemicals after swimmers, that is, paying members, have left. According to Glassdoor: ""Chief Executive Officer salaries at YMCA are as high as $309,620 per year.""  ""Sharon Greenberger, President/CEO of YMCA Greater New York: $793,875"" You can afford it.",1,1
The handicap bathrooms were TERRIBLE for a truly handicap person. Which I am. I severe handicap person CAN NOT step into a bathtub. Why are there not walk in showers?? The hand rails are unusable as well. They are slick and I was not able to lift myself from the non handicap size toilet as well.  Of course the breakfast have had to Change but the boiled eggs were spoiled. They were horrible. Please check your food items before eating and especially serving.,2,1
"Stayed here during a university trip and although the price and location are good, the state of the rooms / facilities are not! Our room had dirty water, hairs, black mould, on the floors and walls. - a long with other mysterious stains and marks! The bottom bunk had wet chewing gum on the frame and the bathroom facilities are not clean either!!",2,1
"We stayed there for 1 week and we didn’t like it. Small rooms, dirty room, we asked for cleaning but they didn’t clean for like 2 days, and you share bathrooms. Plus you have to pay a extra fee for the time you stay there, 60$ for the fitness floor... no information about that before we booked the room.",2,1
"Stayed there for 7 nights.  The bunk beds were loose, ready to fall apart. The door didn't have an inside lock, then they put one on, that I could open from the hallway? There is one bathroom for the whole large floor. The main pool was closed for repairs. The $10 a day fee was charged to me each day, though 2 of the 8 days, the ammenities were not operational for the holidays. The staff are big liars.  They said an upgrade would cost me 250.00 more per night?  The bed is soft and squeaky, and the comforter had a large whole right at the top for your face. No heat in winter. Cold. -the only good was some kindness from the cleaner, and the cafe was alright.",1,1
"Absolutely terrible stay at the Y. We had booked a room with private bath this time after staying at the exact same Y around five years ago. This time, I REALLY wish I had not stayed at this absolutely disgusting and terrible place. I would give NO stars if Tripadvisor had this option.   First of all, read and do not ignore all the bad reviews. They are all true. The check-in staff was extremely rude and tried to scam us. We had booked a private room with private bath but the first room they gave us was a bunk bed with shared bath. We immediately went downstairs after taking one look at the room and told the front desk staff that it was not what we had reserved. The guy at the front desk began by denying that we had made such reservation and said that our reservation had been",1,1
"First off, we were the first time visitors to NY. We thought moving about NY would be confusing and we wanted to be in the middle of NY so choosing location near Central Park would be best. That was our first mistake because getting around in NY by foot and subways were incredibly easy. So the first mistake led us to this ‘hotel/motel/hostel’ from YMCA. It is neither of those three categories. Not a hotl class to be sure and too expensive to call itself motel or hostel.   We got a private “luxury” room with 2 bunk beds (sleep 4). First nigh, it was raining and water started to pour in from a window’s sill. Got some of our clothes damp because we left a suitcase near that window. We went down to “front desk” for help and get pointed to security guard for help. A gentleman from",1,1
"It was very bad, if you want to stay in New-York it’s better to sleep in the street than to sleep here. Moreover, the water in the showers is cold, we were trapped in the elevator. So overpriced, doesn’t worth it at all.",1,1
I’ve stayed in many hostels around the world and this is only one of a handful that I’d never return to. Yes the price for location is awesome but if you are female and allocated a 10th floor beware - you will either freeze in the showers or get burnt as there is no in between. The fact that the bathroom door doesn’t shut properly unless it is practically slammed also makes the door code to enter a joke as in the three days I used the bathroom the door was never locked. Even after cleaning the showers and sinks still looked grungy. I went in one morning as the cleaner was leaving and found toothpaste in one of the sinks. On our return from an overnight tour we were allocated a room on the 8th floor. The shower situation there was a little bit better in that you didn’t get burnt,2,1
"Only good for the location. Super ultra rude staff. Never met so unpolite people before. Narrow, small, and dirty bathroom. Only one bathroom for the entire floor. Ugly old room like from a psychiatric hospital.",1,1
"The only good thing about this hostel is the location, Central Park is literally a few steps away.  The room is very small, bunkbeds very insteady and makes a lot of noise. Bathroom was terrible, there are only two bathrooms for the whole floor (and there are a lot of rooms!), The woman bathroom had 3 showers, but only one works!! Toilets were oke but fast out of toiletpaper.  You have to pay $10 dollar for a membership for gym and pool, even if you are not going to use those facilities!  No kitchen or refrigerator, no lockers for bags in room.  Even for this price I wouldn’t stay at this place again!",2,1
"I booked a single room with semi privatebathroom, which means on the floor there are several single bathrooms you can lock yourself in, but those bathrooms will be used by everyone on the floor. The bathrooms were often dirty, they need to be cleaned more often, and are obviously really old. Do yourself a favour and pack some Clorox wipes. The bedroom was basic, not a big deal I wasn't expecting anything special, but there were holes between the window and its frame and it made the room really cold. Position is good, very close to Columbus circle. It is also relatively cheap, at least if compared to NYC hotels.",2,1
"Of course booking the YMCA we had a certain expectation, we knew it was going to be average but paying 100euro a night is definitely overpriced, even if it is New York. The fact that you can find a 3 or 4 star hotel for the same price is a bit crazy.  The staff were quite unfriendly, except for one guy. We had serious problems with the heating in our room, we had no control to turn it down or off, so much so we were sweating all night, almost getting ill and having to leave the window open, in New York January weather. Again a bit unbelievable. We were told someone would fix this but didnt. The room was quite cramped but would have been okay if it weren't for the blistering heat.  The location was good, right next to the park so of course that's an upside. However for what is",2,1
"My partner and I booked this “hotel” for 5 nights as we were looking for somewhere cheap and to just sleep as we knew we would be busy exploring the city. However this was not a place we wanted to sleep in and we only lasted 3 nights before checking out and checking into a hotel.   We were located on level 4 with bunk beds (in which we were expecting). However this felt more like a prison cell as our beds were terrible with springs poking us and only one pillow and a light blanket each. We had shared bathrooms in which when we booked we were told we had a private bathroom. This was not the case the bathrooms were all in a seperate hallway and out of about 10 bathrooms on level 4: 2 you could not access, multiple had broken toilet seats at different times, the toilets were often",1,1
"The only thing positive about this accommodation is the location. It is in a very nice part of the city. I had a private double room, the bed was almost too small to fit both of us. Room was even smaller than expected. Could hear all street noise as there were holes in the windows that didn't close. Huge gaps under doors meant could also here everything from the hallway, which meant 24 hour staff making noise, guests showering,etc. The showers literally screeched in your face if you wanted a warm shower, so bring ear plugs.... The bathrooms ran out of toilet roll and handtowels daily. Given the cost of this place I really do not think its worth the price tag. Have stayed in many hostels including in other expensive cities but none cost as much as this for how poor it was.",2,1
"The location is fabulous but sadly everything else will leave you distraught & depressed!  To anyone from a first-world country, it is a hovel! About forty years overdue for repairs & renovations! Do NOT consider staying!",1,1
"One morning we woke up because some other guest was given keys to our room.  The staff didn’t do a thing even though I complained about it.  We bought a luggage tickets the night before departure. And next day when we came to use them reception clerk told us they are only valid for yesterday, even though upon getting the tickets I explicitly asked for tomorrow’s ticket.  Only 3 shower cabins per each floor. (50 rooms estimated )   The only thing that’s good is the location of the property.",2,1
"We needed to spend one night in NYC and all the hotels were overpriced because of an UN reunion. That's the reason why we chose this place: more than 110 $ was the cheapest we could find for an apparently 'good' hotel.  1st: THE ARRIVAL: The check in was impossible before 2 or 3 pm. Ok (not even a ""we will try to do it ASAP"" or similar, but ok). So we asked if they could keep our luggage (as ANY hotel in the world would do). ""YES, IT IS 2 USD/BAG"". whaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?!?!?!?!?! 1st time in my whole life I need to pay for that.  2nd: THE ROOM: from the 1st moment we opened that door the smell of the room was awful. We tried to turn on the A/C which didnt clean that air, so we ""tried"" to open the ""window"" (pretty old, dirty, which didnt completely close...). Awful. I have NEVER EVER",1,1
"Worst place to stay. The staff at the front desk sent us to a wrong room. I had to go down after seeing , we booked a room for 2 people while the staff gave us a room for one person.  The air-conditioning is bad,the room is hot,the bunk bed is shaking and makes noise,  the shared bathrooms are super dirty with broken faucets. I paid a huge price for this.",1,1
"The place is mismanaged to such an extent that it will make your head explode. Maybe they should just be a gym and stay focused on that. As for the rooms, small. The staff doesn't seem to know what items should be in the room. Is there a refrigerator? is there a remote? A lamp is broken and not plugged in. Beds in bunks are thin no support. Management apologies for mistakes but it is a serious issue of mismanagement and the staff not making sure rooms have working and all appliances. SAD that the YMCA is run like this as a long time supporter of the Y, I'm very dishearten. They make a lot of money from tourists but I guess they are content to make lots of money doing a half --- job.  The wait when checking in or going back when you find out something is missing or not working in",2,1
"i have never experienced something so bad in my life. The worst hotel in the world !!!! Room was dirty, we didnt say there even for 10minutes! Now they dont want to give our money back.... waste of time and money!",1,1
"Opening the door to our room sounded as if we were kicking it in. The room was small as expected, the soft/flimsy mattress on steel rails, lacked support, every small movement was felt. There was an 1.7 cu. ft. compact refrigerator, an small tv (possibly an 19inch), and an 3 drawer dresser, also an open area for hanging clothing. The bathroom door was unevenly installed, therefore each time it was pulled up it became jammed and was loud upon opening and closing. Our shower door wouldn't close, we had to wedge a towel in it to make it close and the soap holder in the shower had green rust on it. The water took 10-15 minutes to get hot but once hot it was fine. They didn't provide provide wash cloths, just bath towels and lastly, housekeeping just changed the bed linen and",1,1
"The location, right by central park and a major subway intersection, is great for exploring Manhattan. The hostel is also safe/secure for anyone worried about that.   Everything else is a negative. The staff is hit or miss - some very friendly, others clueless (the guy who checked us in didn't even know that the $30 service fee we were asked to pay was actually a $10/night facilities fee) or rude.   Most of the showers (for the men, at least) on the 8th and 9th floor lack proper showerheads - that's complete and total cheapness/laziness on the part of the YMCA. The bathrooms are cleaned, but the paper towel wasn't replenished very frequently and the hooks/ledges to put your toiletries are broken/falling off. None of it matters that much, but it all speaks to the idea that this",2,1
"I don't know where to start.. I might suffer from heigh expectations but here it goes.. First of all my access card was locked twice on my 3-day stay and I had to explain to the crew in the reception that I did check in but they couldn't find my information (yes like passport and other PERSONAL information - did you guys here about the new GDPR? You should take those things serious...). One more thing to add about the check in was that I booked the room by using Hotels.com, garanteed that I could check in whole day. When I showed up at 9 AM, exhausted from my day long flight, YMCA let me know that I couldn't check in before 2.30 PM. They couldn't find me a room before and when I confronted them the fact that they are cooperating with Hotels.com where other rules are to shown,",1,1
"Horrible place. Dirty, disgusting, noisy, run down. Avoid at all cost! It looks like a run down homeless shelter  The location was good, but that's all the good thing I can tell about this place.  I should have spent some more and go to someplace else",1,1
"Basic room but so small, but it is not the worst: it was humide, smelled bad, the toilets cannot be flushed properly. It was so disgusting, yuk!!! Every morning, the water in the toilets was brownish. The ""things"" you flush away come back... I felt so sick. It does not worth the price at all. I have have taken pictures and a video to prove that it's not a lie. You'd better run away and select an Airbnb for that price !!!  The corridor is noisy as nobody cares about the others... People knocking at the doors or yelling in the corridors. The only positive point is the location: next to Central Park and Columbus circle/Lincoln MTA stations.",1,1
"I am not a big fan of the West Side YMCA, but I was making a quick trip into NYC to go to the opera, and the location was convenient.  It used to be pretty cheap - but not so anymore.  Rooms are spartan, no carpet, no hooks on the walls, no door on the closet and the bed had wheels so when you sat on it, it banged against the wall.  Outlets did not work; I had to unplug the lamp to charge my phone.  Hallways smelled slightly of urine and the one bathroom for the entire floor (with several corridors of rooms) was cramped, over-heated and a bit grotty.  No lounge area to sit in.  WiFi worked well.  I was there for less than 12 hours, but I would not return, regardless of the convenient location. Cheaper (and nicer) to go uptown to the HI Hostel or Hotel Broadway.",2,1
"Worst mattress I have ever tried to sleep on!!!  I was taking a nap for 10 minutes and woke up with a sore lower back. In response to that problem the receptionist sent people to replace it, but they got an even worse one. Afterwards, another receptionist tried to give a lame excuse that since it's a hostel there's nothing to be done, and even quiet me down when I tried to give my opinion.",2,1
"We stayed in the hostel/hotel whilst on a school trip from the UK. Whilst we didn't expect anything amazing before we went, i was frankly shocked with the disgrace we were given to stay in. Our door had to be forced locked, our radiator was broken, our room was so small we could hardly fit both me and my friends case in the room. The beds were highly uncomfortable and to top it off the ladder would not connect to the top bunk. We also found a small rusty pin in our bunk on the second night! The bathrooms were small, and very uncomfortable to use. The showers were see through and when sharing with strangers made for an awkward experience. Only 2 of the 3 toilets worked which made for long queues. It became very crowded at a night time and early mornings.   Overall, i believe that",1,1
when we first walked into our room it seemed small but we didn't mind because its not the size of the room that matters. But when you pay to stay in a room you expect some level of cleanliness which unfortunately there wasn't even that. The window was covered in grime and paint from a bad paint job they had try to do. until the day we left we didn't even realize the 3 cracks in the glass panels in the window because the grime and splatted paint seemed to some how mask it. although there was lots of faulty things i cant deny that the location was amazing.,2,1
"I thought YMCA is an organization that represents something good for the society. I changed my mind after staying in that particular accommodation. We had to wait until 15:00 pm to check in which means we had to walk around ny with our bags on hand. Front desk people were rude and not helpful at all. Room was on 8th floor. We had to wait for the elevator sometimes for 10 min. Dorm was like you were in prison. Doors as well. Room was tiny as hell. We couldn't move both at the same time as there was no space to do so. Bed was noise and window was locked. Bathroom... dirty, busy and so uncomfortable. There was no place to leave your towel and clothes. Doors were see-through. No paper sometimes for long. There was no space between the showers and the sinks so when it was busy it was",1,1
"Rooms were like cells, we had noisy neighboors, the shared bathroom was not that clean. When checking in I asked the reception ""how many people are sharing the bathroom"" and she replied ""only one at a time"". Is than an answer? Of course one at a time, I wont be showering with strangers. But she did not eventually answered my real question. How many people will be using the bathroom daily. About 80. Thats the number of rooms on each floor. And only 3 toilets and 3 showers. Stay away from it if you can afford something else. The only pros is the location.",2,1
Expectations were not high when me and my friend paid $50 a night but I've stayed in a few hostels and this West Side YMCA isn't the best value for money. Essentially you pay for the location. The rooms are bare and what can be best described as prison cells. Uncomfortable beds and I had to sleep with my shoes cause the metal bunk bed steps where too painful to walk down without.  Beds are clean but the rooms floor needed a good sweep - there was still hair and dust from previous guests. Noisy air con unit in broken window.  The bathrooms reminded me of 'Orange is the new Black' Netflix's show. Tired tiny facilities with no where to hang your towel and clothes whilst you shower. Toilet doors broken and not cleaned regularly enough. After a day the state of the toilets were,2,1
"I attended the West side YMCA and was bitterly disappointed. Even though going to this hotel I did not expect 5* luxury I expected simple and basic things which were not met. Upon entering the hotel the old fashioned look of the building is reflected some what in the floor and gates on the door, however, this quickly deteriorates as the lounge features tables and chairs that you would expect to see out side a low-quality caffé in a city centre not inside a building. Upon arriving on the floor I was to stay on it was immediately apparent that this was going to be somewhat disappointing due to the brightly coloured orange and blue doors which gave a very dated vibe. upon entering my room I was immediately concerned with the quality of the floor and the bed as they both looked",1,1
"I stayed at YMCA hotel during the end of July for 3 days and unfortunately I had terrible experience. The hotel do not provide any refrigerator in the rooms, the air conditioner was noisy and old as I slept together with a tractor (I had to sleep with earplugs), not to mention the pipe system that passed through my room… The doors of the rooms are made from metal and hold a ventilation lines that remind a little bit the doors of a prison. The place including rooms and bathrooms do not represent the pictures that shown in the hotel website at all! In addition, it is important to mention that there is no separation of the shared bathrooms in the hotel between men and woman at the floors, I had to shower less than 2 min because I was afraid that some weirdo (and there are a lot of",1,1
"I truly believed that not having a bathroom in my room for only three days would be tolerable. Big mistake! I wouldn't stay again in this place - which I chose only because the prices of hotels in New York (and not only in Manhattan) are surreal. But I do have some tips to make the experience at West Side YMCA a bit more pleasant. First and most important one: don't use the bathrooms at the corridors. Even if the hotel had a cleaning staff twice as numerous it would still be impossible to keep all the bathrooms clean during the whole time. The fact that they can be used by both man and women (a decision hard to understand, by the way!) doesn't help either! Use the large and always clean gym's locker rooms to have a shower, dry your hair, go to the toilet, brush your teeth and so",2,1
"The best thing about this place was when we left. My girlfriend had booked here for 3 nights, because of the location. Very close to Central Park & the Metro. She thought the rooms were bigger when she booked. I believe a prison would have been better to stay, I reckon the conditions would have been better. The rooms were small and horrible and the shared bathrooms were disgusting and the hot water never worked.  We ended up leaving early and booking into a Holiday Inn, just so we could get a good shower and a good nights rest, beds were horrible too.",1,1
Because it was my first and last time staying in this place. Please take a decent hotel in New Jersey for half its price. No charging port no towels no locks on bathroom no tissue there is nothing here Please aviod this at each and every cost  Believe me i have a first hand experience,1,1
"We stayed one night at the West Side YMCA over the Easter weekend. We booked it for its good location but were disappointed by the rooms and facilities on offer. We had a room with a bunk bed and shared bathroom. The corridor had a prison block feel, despite the doors being painted in bright colours. The room also felt like a prison cell, with a single bunkbed, a table and lamp and a TV. There was about 1m of floorspace around the bed which made it very cramped for two people to stay. The beds were old, small and uncomfortable and, given the number of rooms on the floor, we were repeatedly disturbed by other guests in the hostel.  The shared bathroom had poor cleanliness. There were only 3 cubicles and 3 showers for the whole floor. One shower was broken and the other two had",1,1
"Only good thing was the location!  I arrived at the YMCA after an 8 hour flight to be greeted by very rude reception staff! Rooms were small, however was not really an issue, main issue was the bunk beds - no ladders and no railing! Didn't help they were on wheel as slid about the floor with every movement. Spotted 2 cockroaches running through the hall of the 11th floor first night - was not impressed. Bathroom were awful!!! SHARED BATHROOMS might i add. Only one coded bathroom per floor with 3 toilet stalls and 3 shower cubicles. During my stay 2 of the toilets were out of order meaning ONE TOILET FOR A WHOLE FLOOR!! Showers were hard to control the temperature and the doors were see through!! The bathrooms were always dirty so obvious no one actually is cleaning them!!",1,1
"As soon as you walk in you will think you have entered a prison. I felt extremely unsafe there, with strange people walking round and whistling until gone 1am. The room was not clean at all and whenever you moved on the metal bunk beds it made too much noise. Me and my friends didn't shower for the whole time we were there because the the communal showers were dirty and the shower curtain was see through and didn't go the whole way across!I would put anyone off from going here, especially if you are travelling alone.",1,1
Room had a hole in the wall. The beds were extremely loud when moving. The toilets were very communal and we all wished we could have showered in peace. I recommend taking swim wear if staying. The good points were the wifi was fast and staff were helpful,2,1
"24 hour desk staff? They were very rude and incompetent. Except one woman who was very nice. The towels had brown stains on them, I dare question what they were. There was cat food in the guest book. The showers were dirty and the rooms smelt. Cheap prices for a hostel should not mean the staff should not care about the upkeep of the showers and rooms. I had no hangers on my extremely small ""wardrobe"" if you can call it that. Shower did not turn off and were cold. Great location and that was the only great thing. I left chocolates in my room and I came back after a tiring day looking forward to a piece, found it all gone! Must have been your maids! Overall my stay at your hostel was okay, but I will not be returning ever again!",2,1
"Welcomne to Hell. The showers had a build up of pubes, grease, feces and other human waste. There was bugs, the room smelt of my nan's breath and cheese when I first walked in. My friend's air conditioning didn't work so we put up with a broken window when the room got sweaty which was often. This place is literally disgusting. If you come here, you will catch some sort of infection and will be straight into the hospital. The worst place I have ever stayed at and I ever will stay at,",1,1
"we arrived after a 7 hour flight and all I needed was a nice place. Did I get that? No. It looks like a prison. The beds are lumpy and creaky. You have to walk into the SHARED bathroom if you want to go to the toilet. Then there is the showers, don't even get me started on the showers. On the 8th floor i presume there is a piece of a cloth to close the shower, on my floor which was the 11th, there was a glass door and you could see whoever was showering. There were clumps of hair in the shower, so great maids you have there. About the maids, they wouldn't even tidy your room, they would just fold up the cover of your bed at put it in the corner! wow. The blinds didn't shut and the windows were crap. Don't go, just don't do it. Seriously. Don't.",2,1
"I stayed there for 12 day over Christmas and new years eve. As soon as we walked into our room it immediately stank, and we were unable to open the window, and to top it all off our heater/ air conditioner didn't work. There was no hot water on our floor we had to go down and use the gym showers if we wanted hot water. The bunk beds were metal and every time someone moved it made a loud screeching noise. My stay there was horrendous i have never stayed in a place that bad, i would recommend anyone considering this hostel to avoid it and find somewhere else!!!",1,1
"I was kinda happy when I left. Showers took so long to get warm water, it was actually easier to go to the gym locker room to take a shower.  The shower on the room floors were dirty, and most of them did not work. The bathrooms were not very clean, and the sinks were disgusting.  The Gym lockerroom was outdated, with a large number of lockers that were damaged. The sauna and the steam room were nice, and the showers were okay.  All in all, I'd reccoemd going to the Vanderbilt YMCA. It's comparable in price, and it's much cleaner and comfortable.",2,1
"I stayed at the ymca west side for about 8 days. First impressions are the bunk room is not suitable for two people; one person would have to sit on the bed to allow the other person to walk around while jumping over luggage. The bathrooms, 2 out of the 3 shower heads were broken, usable but would spray water in all directions. There is no way to put your clothes/toiletries when you shower. Don't bother asking the cleaners questions, as none of them speak English. Café staff are rude. Security however are brilliant and helpful! Location is great, only a short walk to time square/central park and subway!",2,1
"Despite all the comments about the quality of this place compared to the price, I totally disagree that it's worth! I'm saying that because I've stayed in the Vanderbilt YMCA, and it's far more clean, organised, comfortable and above all: the staff was friendly and helpful.  I can't tell you the same about the West Side.  First of all, we arrived very tired after 9 hours flying plus 1 hour waiting at the airport immigration, and we needed to store our luggage for at least chill in Central Park that is steps away, because early check in was not available (I'm not complaining, just saying! I know early check in depends on availability of rooms), and it took at least 30 minutes for them to locate someone to open the door of the place that is reserved to store the luggage of guests",2,1
"I'll get this off the table straight away, the staff were really nice and helpful. That's my only real positive in this review, I just felt the pricing and reviews on booking.com were the exact opposite. The rooms are severely dated, the cost of the rooms is wildly high for what was on offer. I would never ever stay here in winter, I froze for my two night stay and wasn't impressed. The best thing is you can disappear into central park for hours to avoid the room until some of the nearby restaurants open. It was so cold I had to wear most of my winter clothes, super sick today. Stay in summer only for the location that's my advice, I'll never stay there again.",2,1
"Blame it on expensive hotel rate elsewhere, I stayed here because of it's cheaper. On the plus side, the location is very very good.   Daily room cleaning was omitted even I returned to my room at 2pm on Sunday. I read again and again on their guest information book: ""We like to keep our room clean, if you place ""do not disturb sign"" your room will be cleaned after 2pm. Guest cannot refuse room service for more than a day. Please notify the front desk if you don't want room service for one day."" Oh well, whatever, liar.  No additional power plug. If you need to charge phone battery, unplug the desk lamp cable cord from the socket.   Semi private bathroom is shared with other guests. We need to tap our room key to unlock them. Do not forget to lock your bathroom while using it,",2,1
"The YMCA is at a supreme location but very expensive in terms of money which we paid. The staff was not at all supportive and very rude. The rooms are not having much space to move with luggage and wash rooms are not attached. It is having a common toilet and it was not very comfortable. Drinking water cooler was not functioning. I was there to attend a conference with Microsoft. Booked online but later on realized that in this rate, we were having many options and get much better hotel.",2,1
"I wont stay here again even if it is near central park. The receptionists were not helpful or welcoming, and when I arrived at my room there were some men just randomly hanging around there doing nothing. As a solo traveller I didnt feel safe. The air con was so loud I could not keep it on. Only good thing was the private room element. Showers were dirty with hairs in the bottom and dirt everywhere. There was puddles of water on the floor by the sink which created a mess too. All in all not very relaxing. I was going to hostels all around the area so i am not high maintenance. I just would not go here again sadly. Which is sad as I respect the YMCA and the work that it does in general terms.",1,1
"We had a private room with bunk beds, can't lie not what I was expecting at all it was tiny and nothing in the room no home comforts at all. There was a shared bathroom with misted glass doors on the showers but this gave no privacy at all. For the price it cost you can really moan - right on Central Park. Good for travellers and there are dorms from what I believe but we were going on a romantic weekend away and got confused with booking the hotel, the room was quiet and mostly clean and so cheap. The place did have a fantastic gym though with good quality equipment and range of machines and weights.",2,1
"Be very careful when you book through expedia. the rate I paid through expedia was about double when I reviewed other sites which was certainly too much for a bunk bed. You must realise that this building is over 100 years old, the rooms are not like to photos. They are dirty and smelly. Very very small. Actually, depressing. Every bathroom on our floor had something broken and there were two not in use.  I reported leaking pipes and nothing was attended to during my 8 day stay. Beware, take an eye mask to sleep because the lights from the hall come through the slats in the door. You need to wear ear plugs to sleep, constant slamming of doors all night. They must be at least 60 rooms on a floor. Nose clip for the smell!  Having said this the location could not be better, you can",2,1
The line to check in was long and slow. they offer a lot of service's but only one line so the wait was long. I paid $120 for one night and didnt expect much. yup i was right. Creeky bunk beds that squeeked with the slighest movement. Bare rooms. Clean but bare. The add said shared bathroom. I expected one other room perhaps. nope! the hole floor. 10 pluse rooms shareing three showers and four stalls. umm bring your flip flops. I was charged once by paypall to travelocity then they charged me again to my credit card when i checked in. I didnt realise this till days later. many calls and emails. they will not respond!,2,1
"This place may be cheap but I would have rather use air bnb after my experience here.  Its cheap for new york but don't expect much. A single bed on wheels that rolls around all night, a tiny blanket and minuscule towel; a small tv and a small dresser or table is all you will get. Bathrooms are shared.  None of this bothered me though as it was the cheapest place I could find and it's a great location - right across from Central Park.  My entire problem with this place is it's ethics and lack of customer service.  Don't bother using the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door because it gets ignored. The company policy - without telling you - is they must check the rooms despite the do not disturb sign. I would have no problem with this if I had known.  BUT THEY DON'T TELL YOU.  Due",1,1
"Great location and price. Room is small but absolutely adequate. Good air conditioning. So i was very happy until i went to bed. Apparently my floor (13th) had been rennovated. But the mattress is the worst i've ever slept on. Completely sagging, springs right beneath the surface and painful to lie on. I changed rooms but the second one was just as bad.   Sure its cheap, but the most fundamental purpose of a hotel/hostel is sleep. It really is not too much to ask for comfortable mattresses - they don't need to be luxury. but this is shocking.",1,1
"Uncomfortable beds, dirty carpets: the light wasn't working so we complained with the receptionist who told us they would fix it and in 5 days they didn't. Not enough room to move in the room. It wasn't even that cheap. The location was good though",2,1
"Pro: good location near central park, clean (but very thin/used) sheets  Con: the most foul customer service I have ever experienced in my life (being talked to rudely, ignored, and the front desk purposely ignoring multiple calls from Expedia customer service and then being rude to the Expedia representative), dirty communal bathrooms with poor drainage, saggy bunk beds with no back support, dirty bleach gym smell in the hallways, poor cell-phone service coverage, 90+ min check-in   Out of the countless places I've stayed in my life, this was the first booking I made where I checked out early, after 1 night.   The YMCA West Side was a nightmare from beginning to end.   Check-in took over 90 minutes, with both of the front desk staff behaving exceptionally rudely. They talked to",1,1
Currently staying here for 14 nights. I tried to shorten my stay by one night (check out a day earlier) and via email was told it would cost me more money to stay one less night. When I replied questioning this I never got a reply.  I also requested a room change but was told this was not possible.  Pros: Location Friendly staff Price  Cons: VERY small towels (not enough to cover the important bits) and the shower curtains don't close all the way so you have to be ok with people seeing you naked. No kitchen so you can't make any of your own meals not even 2 minute noodles Not very clean in general the rooms and bathroom are not heaps clean but good enough Flat screen TV in room but reception is fuzzy on all channels,2,1
So dirty and stinky. We had a double bed with private bath. Carpet looked like it was last cleaned in 1990s. The room stank of sweat. Shower barely worked. A/C didn't work at all. Not worth $170/night. The only star is for great location to Central park and metro etc.,1,1
"We reserved a standard double room with a private bath. We were given a room smaller than the average walk in closet with a bathroom a quarter mile away. My daughter is claustrophobic, prone to panic attacks and had one within a minute of walking in. We immediately went down and checked out. This place should be ashamed of themselves for misrepresenting their accommodations.",1,1
"I booked a single room for 1 night based on photos and also the location for my first night in New York. When I arrived the person at the desk wanted to keep my passport for security as it was late in the evening, never have I ever had to do that before. Luckily they accepted my drivers license instead. The room was all white, the bed was white also and on wheels I felt like I was in a hospital bed.  The showers on my level were really strange, no where to put your things and 1/3 didn't work. For the price I paid I honestly feel like you can spend an extra $30 per night and you can go somewhere so much better!",1,1
"This was my first time in NYC and most likely it will be the last time. Obviously experiences are subjective but I see a lot of misery and dirtiness. The hotel YMCA is located next to central park. In order to enter, you have to go thorough security. I'm glad because there are really ask kind of people around and better be safe than sorry. The check-in procedure took half hour, with verification of ID, reservation, etc.  The room we got was a simple 10 by 10 with a bunk bed, 1 sheet and 1 towel for each.  One chair one table and one TV. Pretty much like a jail. The bathroom is shared on the floor but you can lock in and have some privacy. I saw a huge cockroach the size of a quarter coming out from the sink. Loud people around 24h per day. Overall a bad experience I don't",2,1
"Stayed with a large group and have to say the hostel is very basic. On the outside looks okay. But once in it needs a major upgrade. The meeting area on the ground level floor has some chairs and tables which are quite old fashioned. There are three lifts to all floors. With floors 9-13 the rooms for the people staying at hostel. Staying on the 11th floor I had a single room with a bed with wheels on and for some reason you couldn't lock the wheels. So once in the bed it moves a lot. Room has space for a small storage area for clothes and window opens slightly, has air con but was so noisy had to turn it off. Room is very basic and is well out of date.  The hostel is based on 63rd street and is less than 5 minutes to the tube on 59th street.  Location is good but needs a massive",2,1
"I choose this place because of being in the center and literally didn't expect to be perfect when I consider the reasonable price. However, having no heating in the room when the temperature is around 4C is unacceptable, especially if it is done on purpose, just to cut of the expenses! When I first arrived, the heater wasn't working and basically slept with my coat on, since noone answered my phone call. In the morning, they told me that they can send an engineer to fix, but I needed to be in the room. I waited in the room, noone came, but the heater started working after 10 min. I left the room and thought that everything was ok, but when I was back in the evening it was off again! I gave a call and they told me they were going to fix it. I waited for 1 hour and it wasn't",1,1
"The West Side YMCA is in a great location. We were on the 13th floor and the bathrooms were usually pretty clean and I never had to wait. The rooms are absolutely tiny and the wifi didn't work in our room, only in the hallway. It's definitely a ""family "" hostel, not many young people about. The bunks weren't too bad but we did see a bed bug on the bed. Overall, the location was great to be in the centre of NYC and we walked everywhere, but it's a bit scary indoors.",2,1
"We expected it to be basic but it was awful. Our room was like a prison cell, it literally just had a bunk bed and a desk.The walls had paint peeling off and stains on them. The furniture was scruffy and old. The TV was so grainy we couldn't watch it (not that we wanted to stay in the room long enough to watch it!). The window frame and ledge was rusty and the paint had come off. One night it rained and the rain on the air-conditioning unit outside was so loud hitting the metal we didn't sleep until it stopped and the closed window leaked. The wifi did not work in our room. They made us pay and extra $20 for access to the gym which we didn't want- we came to NYC to see it, not use the gym.   The shared bathrooms were not very clean especially by the evening. They were cleaned at",1,1
"I couldnt fault the location, only a 5 min walk from times square and over the road from central park. HOWEVER, my room was basically a tiny room  with a set of bunck beds in (also no ladder to get onto  the top so i had to use the bed frame which i thought was dangerous. The shared bathrooms were atrocious, there was only 3 toliets and 3 showers for the whole floor, which i must add were discusting, i actually got an infected toe from the shower, also the shower curtain didnt even cover the gap you could see in. The receptionist staff were stuck up and snotty, very rude.",2,1
Stayed here for 3 nights this weekend and was pretty disappointed. Nothing to do with the standard. The standards are pretty low but that's exactly what I was expecting for the price you pay.   Taxi from JFK cost me just shy of $60. I got the subway back to JFK though and that cost me $11. Pretty easy to do. Airport train to Howard beach ($8) then transfer onto the a train which goes all the way to Columbus circle ($3) and then it's only a couple of blocks walk.   The reason why I was disappointed was because of 3 reasons:  1. Every single morning I hung the do not disturb sign on the door as I was concerned about security as my iPad etc was in the room. Every single morning the sign was ignored and the maid made up my room.   2. There is only 1 bathroom per floor. That in,2,1
"My girlfriend and I booked a last-minute trip to NY. Unfortunately we hadn't realised it was over the marathon weekend, and were very (very!) limited with our hotel choices. Our stay here was therefore out of necessity more than anything else. Nonetheless, the bunk beds in our room were not particularly comfortable, so we didn't get a great sleep. The shared bathroom was also not great. But, the YMCA seems to be very well run (check-in/out was efficient etc.), and it is very well located (close to Central Park). As long as you know what you're in for, this place does exactly what it says on the tin.",2,1
hotel was not good. too many boys on the trip. donuts were stale. swimming pool was unavailable. lady at desk was rude. man at desk was rude. elevators were slow and wet(?). poor poor poor poor experience,1,1
"I loved the location.  This place is right across the street from Central Park.  It is within walking distance of several museums, Times Square, Broadway and many other places.  The price was quite a bit lower than almost everything else available. The employees are nice.  I liked the little store. It was convenient and the prices are reasonable.    My room was ok, it was nothing fancy at all.  It was small but is was clean. The AC was powerful.  The room was nice and cool when I got there.  The bed was not the most comfortable.  It was not much bigger than a cot and I could feel the springs in the mattress.  The shared bathroom was not very clean.    If you are someone who is used to staying in moderate to nice hotels, I would not recommend this place.  I would only stay again",2,1
"I stayed at the West Side YMCA Hostel for only one night, but it was the worst night ever.The staff was not rude but whenever I was approaching them with basic questions(I had to because they didn't explain anything when I was checking in), the facial expressions of the ladies at the reception were not friendly, rather highly annoyed and bored.The hostel is very big and crowded.My room was located at the 9th floor.The noise coming from the ventilation outside was unbearable.The moment I entered the room I realized immediately that the night was going to be sleepless and requested to be moved elsewhere.They did move me, however, the new room was at the same floor, same noisy.I haven't slept the whole night.The location is good, so if you are not planning to sleep but prefer to",2,1
"What a fantastic location for a hostel. Being on a budget, staying in Manhattan is tricky, but for the price of a 5 star spa hotel in Budapest, you can get a nights stay here at this well located NYC hostel. So if you want location and don't want to have to travel in from Long Island or other places to save money, and don't mind staying in less luxurious accommodation, this is for you.  It is expensive for a hostel, but again for Manhattan this is a bargain.  30s walk to Central Park, 5 minutes to both Columbus circle and in the other direction the Lincoln centre.  Showers and toilets in the gym facilities were superbly clean, compared to the shared toilets and showers in the accommodation. All three nights I stayed, I could not even use the shared toilet block on my floor so I",2,1
We spend just one night here and this hostel had all we needed- room with bed and shared bathroom. The room was small and simple. Not exactly clean but okay. We didn't care. But the bathroom was disgusting. 2 out of 3 toilets didn't flush and showers were nasty. We survive and we would probably stay again cause the location is great and who needs to sleep in NYC right?! :D it just seemed a little overpriced for that.,2,1
The staff could´ve done a better job at welcoming us and making us feel at home. The only seemed bothered by our presence and their attitude towards their job made me feel like they didn´t even want to be their. Keep those feelings outside of work and do your job!,2,1
"Really bad room, really bad staff, really bad facilities, no extras (like all other hotels), wifi was difficult to attain, constantly too hot, it's like the literally didn't care about anyone in there and were just churning people in and out as fast and cheaply as possible.",1,1
"You will probably consider this hotel if you're short on cash. Great location. But the hotel is worn down. I'm not a picky type, but had to ask for another room when I found half-eaten food and used q-tips on the floor. Cleaning is not that good in showers. Walls are definitely not sound proof! More like cardboard-walls.",2,1
"My mom and I stayed here for a week. We had a bunk bed room, and the mattresses were comfy. However, the sheets were only changed once throughout the week we stayed. The room had ants, and housekeeping threw away our leftover food we had brought back from dinner the previous night. Besides the constant smell of wet carpet in the hallways and the ants, the stay was good enough. You get what you pay for here, nothing special but a place to sleep and rest if you need it. I wouldn't stay here again, but it is good for guests on a tight budget.",2,1
"Had to PAY for luggage storage, which is in a secure location, behind security desk, many cameras pointing at the door. When I return to YMCA less than 4 hours after putting my luggage in safe area, I check my things only to find my Ipad had been stolen!!! The man at security refused to help, said that was nothing he could do. When I asked him to review the cameras he said, he wouldn't waste his time. ""Do you know how many people go through there a day"", I responded with "" We have been gone less than 4 hours, when we put our bags in there, there were only 3 other bags and the same bags are still there!!! I highly doubt that many people PAID to put there bags in the LOCKED luggage storage room for 3.5 hours. They refuse to help you make a police report or contact the police, they",1,1
A staff of the hostel entered in the room of my son and stole the charger. God sake the case was with a padlock. Too much money paid in a place not secure. At the end people was very nice but the charger does not come back.,1,1
"Stayed here one night, which was one night too many.  Have happily stayed in other YMCA accommodation before, but this one did not compare.  The room was literally rotting, the sensor lights tame on every time I rolled over in bed, the big box TV didn't work.  It was actually revolting.  My first thoughts on seeing the room was that this was a converted prison.  We were booked in for four nights, but cancelled the rest of our stay as it would have ruined our time in.NYC.  Not comfortable.",1,1
"The dirtiest, unfriendliest, and most expensive hostel I have ever stayed in. Do NOT stay here! The rooms were freezing and I was told the heating doesn't work, the toilet didn't flush and the showers and no hot water. What a horrible experience.",1,1
"The location is perfect, a few steps from the Central Park, perhaps a mile from Times Square, 300 feet from the Lincoln Center and the subway station and the facility is as ""spartan"" as you should expect from a YMCA chain...but the lack of maintenance is more than obvious. It takes too long for the service personnel to clean the bathrooms, once they forgot to leave me soap and shampoo, in other ocasion they forgot my towel,...This kind of hotels is thought to give a service below the average, but I felt that actually it is below the below.",2,1
I was traveling standby to new York where I had a reservation thru booking.com at the Westside ymca. Storms caused me to get stuck in San Antonio for a day.  I tried numerous times to contact the hotel to see if they would hold my reservation but never heard a response of any sort. Their message claimed they would return calls quickly which now seems laughable. Decided to cancel the trip because I did not know if I had a place to stay and did not want to risk paying outrageous new york hotel prices. Next time I will have to book with airbnb.,1,1
"I went with a friend to spend 4 days in New York. We were told YMCA is a large chain of good american hostels. Great location, near Central Park and subway station. Good communication to main services. Kind personnel treat. We payed for private bathroom and we were scammed, so we had to use the shared ones. Our room consisted in a berth and a destroyed bureau. The mattresses were completely uncomfortable and very noisy. The pillow was so flat you were laying your head on the mattress. The walls were full of holes. Our first impression was it looks like a junkyard. Bad house keeping.  I recommend this place if you don't mind sharing bathroom, simple bedrooms, noisy next door partners.  Thank you!",1,1
The hotel is located very close to subway and central park so it was very convenient to travel around. I booked a room with the semi private bathroom. The room is too small and not very clean and included stained carpet. The air box near the window was open and broken which made the air from outside flow inside. The bathroom is not clean either even though it is a semi private one. (You will only use your keycard to access the bathroom). There was a free wifi provided but very bad if used on the high floors. The service was not bad for me. Other than that it is okay.,2,1
"Well location was great but the stuff act like a police in prison,especially the guys at the fronte desk. They treat me like I was been there for free 8 days.The room was clean but the bathroom look like hospital for hommles.However for that price you can finde a hotel where you will be treated like a guest with dignity.",1,1
Excellent location close to the metro station at Culumbus circle and sout entrance of central park. Horrible prison like room! But a comfotable bed. So a good choise if you only need a cheap place to sleep while visiting NYC.,2,1
"I booked a room via phone with the on site staff of this hostel in July for a stay in September. While booking, the on site staff made me aware that the reservation staff off site had a habit of deleting reservations made in house so she made notes on my reservation not to move my room. I called in September to confirm the reservation prior to traveling as I would be arriving in NYC late at night. Sure enough, the reservation had been lost and because the hostel was booked I could not make a new reservation. I had to scramble to find other accommodations that took $119 out of an already tight budget. To add insult to injury the off-site reservation staff person was extremely condescending and rude. He spoke over top of me when I tried to explain my conversation with the on site",1,1
"We came from staying at motels on the west coast so got used to queen size beds each not small bunk beds. Things didn't start of well when we got there early and so had to pay $2 per back to leave them and go explorering, when we did come back and went to the room it's a little horrible, the walls are plain and the doors just have a vent so it looks like you are walking through a cell block. Once inside we did have a window which made it look a little nicer. Basically this place is definitely a budget stay, although I still think over priced for what you get. A sink in the room or even a little picture to give out done color would be brilliant. On a positive the location is very good!",2,1
"I got bed bug bites all over my body from my stay in a room at this YMCA in early September. The staff tried to imply I brought the bugs with me (did I take a bus or train?)  They gave me another room, but did not offer to clean my clothes or reimburse me or even say sorry.  In addition to a dozen bites, I have thrown out all my clothes before returning home.  And they did not tell the people in the nearby rooms or move them out",1,1
"If you can avoid it, avoid it.  Quite expensive.  I was a girl, staying 10 nights there, on the 13 floor: the ""luxury"" one: still you can see the pictures, not quite clean.  I had stained sheets, which weren't changed for like 4 days.  Once I went to the bathroom around midnight, one guy almost naked in his room asked me to come to help him find something under his bed...! And I saw someone naked in the bathroom who didn't locked the door, and didn't seem even embarassed  The staff is really the worst, at the reception you can wait 10 minutes and see other employees looking at us but not helping.  Girls working there look really annoying by customers.  The cleaning lady knocks like 3 times to make your room, and yell ""house keeping"", even if there is a do not disturb sign on the",2,1
"The room was ok, the sheets were clean. However, the bed had rollers like an office chair and that would wake me up each time I turned around in it. The room was quite spacious considering it was a single room. The biggest problem I had with the hygiene in the bathroom. With literally no ventilation it was stuffy and the showers were full of mould. I didn't dare take a shower. The toilets were pretty dirty too but that was mostly a fault of the visitors. The receptionist wast very pleasant either. The price was quite good in New York terms.",2,1
Please don't waste your money. Its not worth. bad was uncomfortable. bathroom was dirty and non functioning. Smelly place. Not at all good for couples and no go for family. Please book better hotel near by.,1,1
"A tiny dirty room here cost me $120 a night.  There were ants in one of the common private bathrooms that I used on floor 10 where the ""deluxe"" rooms are.  The locations is excellent, though, so if you don't mind dirt and a mattress that is as stiff as a board this is your choice  By the way, the staff person who checked me in was rude as well and unhelpful  For the price, I was charged, I'll stay in Long Island City, pay about the same, and have a nice room with a private bathroom.  I made a mistake.  This was a last minute trip and those hotels in L.I.C were unavailable.  This place is awful, however, and to be avoided.",1,1
"My fiancé and I made the terrible mistake of waiting until a few weeks before our week in New York to book our accommodation. And yes, we did try AirBnB and Couchsurfing. For $175USD per night we got a tiny room with two single bunks. The first room we were given stunk of cigarette smoke, so we asked to be moved, so they moved us to a room which had the spy hole on the door(which allows guests to see outside the door) REVERSED so people out of our room could see inside it! You have to show your room key every time you enter the YMCA to grumpy security guards, and you have to pay money using an arcane booking system just to bring your own bags to a not-too-secure room while you wait to check in. Any other guest could steal from your bags while they are putting their bags in",2,1
"The rooms were okay because we didn't have to share, but the bathroom had only one stall that could be used because the rest were disgusting. There was no place to change or put your things while showering.",2,1
Only stay a few nights as it's pretty basic and tired even if the location is great. Think next time I will couch surf or Air b&b rather than this place! Helpful staff though and easy to find some decent local diners to have breakfast out.,2,1
It was the worst experience! The room was so small and the room and hallway smelt disgusting like vomit & urine. The bathrooms were so dirty and they smelt terrible! The beds were extremely uncomfortable! It was the worst place I have ever been we stayed there one night then had to move hotels because the smell made my friend vomit! Never ever stay there! Such a bad experience.,1,1
"I have stayed at the West Side YMCA several times.  For me it's the difference between being able to stay in Manhattan, or not going to NYC at all because hotels are very expensive there.  However, the Y continues to increase their room rates, but do  little to maintain the condition of the rooms!  This last time I noticed that the entire ""renovated"" 12th floor is looking rather dilapidated.  YMCA should attempt to maintain the condition of the rooms they rent.  I have been assigned better rooms in the past and they used to charge a lot less.  I do not expect luxury at the YMCA, just a clean bed.  But the room I was assigned this last time was depressing.  I paid $140 for a 2-bed bunk room that was advertised as their ""best bunk bed room"",   I am convinced I could have saved the",2,1
"I booked at the YMCA after struggling to find a hotel that would let me stay for one night over the weekend in the area. I booked a deluxe room which is located on the upper two floors.  Pros: The location is great, steps to central park and the subway is only a few blocks away. I was extremely surprised when I discovered I had a corner room that overlooked central park, something you pay a few hundred more for at a hotel. The bathrooms were also better than average for a hostel and there was always hot water with good pressure. Cons: The room was extremely tired, skirting board peeling from the wall, chunks of plaster missing from the wall and lamp without a lampshade that didn't work. There is a wall a/c unit which worked well, however to keep the room cool I had to leave it",2,1
Visited in September 2011 on a school trip so its a bit of a late review but could never remember the name of the place. It was awful! Our room had two single beds placed on top of each other that where on wheels and not fastened together. Dangerous! There was stains on the bedding. Disgusting! There was mould and damp along the walls. We decided to venture to the sauna which was okay but in the shower area the cleaner left the cupboard open and it was full of cockroaches which then began crawling around the shower cubicles. Eww! Also the floor that we were staying on absolutely stunk of weed and when we complained the management did and said nothing! Only positive thing is that it's located across from central park and is a short walk from the National History Museum and Fifth,1,1
"This hostel is in a very good location, close to central park and the subway station. Other than that everything else was poor. I stayed in a single room which was a decent size, but decoration was very sparse and kind of felt like a prison cell. The bed was very hard and uncomfortable. The air conditioning/heating didn't work and when I asked at the front desk they promised to send an engineer to fix it. No one ever arrived! There was a lot of noise from outside, a constant buzzing. The bathrooms were not very clean and there was no ventilation in there which meant it was very damp and sticky. I'm sure I could have gotten somewhere better for the price I paid here.",2,1
"“First you can this hostel can start by taking down either very old or 'staged' room photos- It doesn't look anything close to that level cleanliness or esthetics / The Westside YMCA is a very scary place to stay and perhaps a ripe place to catch catch SARS or MERSA-. The entire hostel needed repairs, upgrading, carpet and for God's sake, more than the nasty filthy 4 stalls shared bathrooms for 50 guest rooms on each floor!! The dorms were a clean enough 'crash pad' but you get an F for the bathrooms. GLOOMY!!”",1,1
"I thought that it being under the name hostel that this place would have a social environment but it is extremely hard to meet other people as a solo traveller. The bathrooms are the worst I have seen, almost threw up from the smell when I first walked in. The showers are horrible and fluctuate from boiling hot to cold with no shower head making the pressure sometimes painful and no where to store your clothes. The location is great because it is in the centre of things but the transportation around new york is super easy so you do not need to stay heee just because of the location. The beds have wheels on them which is so annoying everytime I moved in bed I would scoot across the floor. Beds are rock hard and have had a sore back and neck everyday when waking up. Never going to",1,1
The hotel has a splendid location right by the park and is within short distance of the subway. The beds are comfortable and there are fitness and swimming possibilities... That being said the hotel is really just a place to kick back after a day in NY! The service isn't extraordinary and I wouldn't pick the hotel for any other reason than the obvious financial perk. The hotel has great wifi strong enough to maintain a Skype call. That is when the wifi is working of course...,2,1
This place is dog crap.  There was poo on the shower floor and my bed was damp with sweat and piss. Never go here its literally hell on earth.  People were knocking on my door all night and there was maggots on the floor. GRIM.,1,1
"Firstly, it was in a good location close to a subway. However I would never ever stay here again and i would highly recommend avoiding this place like the plague! I understand you have to share the shower and toilets and that would be okay if they were clean, there was all sorts of unmentionables on the floor e.g blood, and the showers were freezing half the week I was there. The rooms were tiny and the beds awkward and horrible. The bunk bed in the rooms is on wheels and has no ladder so it is a nightmare to get up there, an effort every night that is actually very dangerous. The mini place to get food is reasonable but with hardly any choice. The worst of all, is the disregard the people had for your personal things. The cleaners took a very important and sentimental toy from",1,1
"I brought a college trip here and I had told the students it would be basic. There is basic and there is inhabitable. This place verges on the latter, it ought to be condemned. The receptionist was deplorable and I can honestly say I have NEVER been treated in such an offensive manner in all my life, for a country that prides itself on customer service this trip contradicted that in so many ways but the epitome was this hostel. I can't even waste any more time on this but I would never recommend it to anyone. Appalling",1,1
"The only good thing about this place is the location. Other than that, this place was absolutely disgusting. Customer service was horrible and the hallway leading to our room smelled of feces. I understand that this place is very cheap but it's so not worth it in my opinion.",1,1
"I stayed at the YMCA Westside in New York with a friend of mine for New Years. It was advertised as a hotel, however our PRIVATE room at $125 p/night didn't even have a bathroom in it! Our bunk bed was on wheels and moved all over the tiny room everytime one of us rolled over. The hot water wasn't working at all over our 5 night stay and the cold showers we were forced to take were in showers with see through glass doors or had shower curtains that didn't reach across the shower so we had no privacy from other guests. The heat in our room didn't work. I asked for extra blankets multiple times only to have the rude staff ignore my request everytime. Staff were very rude with no customer service skills whatsoever and gave false information about the area. The Wifi didn't work at",1,1
"A friend and I travelled to New York for New Years this year. We had booked the ymca, expecting fairly budget but somewhat good accommodation (for the rather expensive price). Unfortunately we were disappointed and disgusted. The showers were cold and the shower glass is see through in the shared bathrooms, the bunk bed rolled around the floor when we moved, the room was TINY, staff we're rude and we generally felt unsafe staying there. Next time, I will be paying much less to stay in a hostel which far exceeds the ymca.",1,1
"I have stayed at this y several times over the last few years and this last visit was the worst. I'd heard about the 8th floor, but had never stayed there...until this time. Cigarette smell was repulsive, but the bathroom was even worse: one woman's room with 3 dirty shower stalls. Torn, dirty shower curtains, zero privacy. Everyone shocked. No place to hang clothes or change in privacy, dirty, one toilet out of three backed up and/or unlockable. Dirty mess all day long. Really? I have travellled all over the world and the state of this floor was pretty amazing. Other floors at this Y are fine -- not spectacular, but not notably grimy.  Also, this time around, the reservation got mixed up seriously enough that two young guests walked right into our 'room'... The folks at",2,1
Good locaition . BUT bad bad badddddddddddd rooms!!!  rooms on the eighth floor reek of cigarette and lsmell  like  Ashtrays! I had to fight a lot with the attendant to change us to another room! and after  she call security to check if the room was really stinky she  informed me I would have to pay 50US  to exchange for a room identical but without the smell of cigarette I  had to fight and make a scandal to get trade without paying the difference thas was  absurd! I think paying $ 90 for a room where everything is CRAP  its  not worth it!!,1,1
"Well I don't know if it's normal that kind of price. Like I thought it would be more good-looking room. Otherwise I felt secure and safe in the hostel. I didn't try the pool or the jim, because I didn't have enough time. I expected more from the interior. There wasn't toilet paper, liquid soap. I was on an non renovated floor and the photo in the web site was with rooms on the renovated one. The good thing is definitely the location. The security is good, and the employees are polite and friendly.",2,1
"We stayed here recently.  We were clearly in the dingy part with the big steel doors that looked like a prison on each room.  The tiles were falling off the walls in the bathrooms, and there was a plastic toilet paper dispenser that had cracked into sharp little pieces which stuck out from the wall.  BUt what concerns me the most is the fact that it is so hard to find the exits on each floor!  We have actually been in a hotel fire once while on vacation and it was TERRIFYING.  Now I always make sure that I know where the exits are and that I could find them even in the dark.  I'm not confident that we could make it out of this building.  At one point during our stay at this Y, we got tired of waiting for the elevator and tried to take the stairs down.  THe stairwell didn't go",1,1
"This is the most discusting place i ever stayed! The carpets and beds smells like urine, the sheets were extremely dirty, cabel TV was snow and barely watchable, poop was spread on the toilet walls, gorgeous muchroom in the showers, all night long noisy drunk germans in the hallways, staff was very rude, room are the size of a shoebox, i think they taped there water out the hudson river, the AC was louder then the drunk germans, broken window in our room fixed with plastic bag etc. I could go on and on. The only nice thing were the sport accomodations. Avoid this place at all time!!!",1,1
"This was by far the worst ""hotel"" i have ever stayed in. We stayed on the 13th floor which is said to be a new upgraded and renovated floor with private facilities and improved rooms with new furniture and features.   The hotel was horrible and dirty and the room was discussing, i had to buy cleaning products before i could sleep in there or even touch anything. When entering the hotel we went in to a small dirty lobby which was cold and dated. We went up in the elevator to the 13th floor and when the doors opened i felt a rush of hot stale air which was full of dust.  When we entered the room with the wireless key card we actually entered a prison cell, a small room with a bunk bed with a desk and 4 shelves. My first shock was the window! A moldy and damp window which was",2,1
"I stayed here for two nights with a group of friends while travelling. We chose this hostel mainly because of the location - which was great for the tourist trail. However we told them we would be checking in late and they emailed back and said that was fine but on check in they were less than accomodating, they also forgot to mention a break out of bed bugs and the showers and toilets were DISGUSTING! I have stayed in plenty of hostels around the world and this would have to be one of the worst.",2,1
"The Hostel have a good location, next to the central park, that is a thing i could not complain about it. But the rooms are very tight and also a little dirty. The common bathroom was a total CAOS. There was piss all over the floor and the sink din't work for good. The staff is another thing that i could not complain about, very compressive...",2,1
"I was booked to stay in your hotel last week, but having spent 1/2 an hour there I checked out and found alternative accommodation. It was scary, I felt as a single female, totally unsafe. I would not recommend it to anyone",1,1
"This is my third time at the West Side YMCA over the past 10 years, not including two says at the Vanderbilt YMCA.  While the front staff was very nice and security guard at night was professional, the rooms now have fluorescent lights that snap on when sensing any movement.  I realized this on my first night at 2AM when I turned over in bed.  Voila!  Bright incandescent light poured down on to me.  The bed is far enough so I had to tiredly walk over, manually shut it off, and creep quickly back into bed.  3 hours later, I woke up and needed to turn my head.  I ever so slowly turned in slow motion, trying to use my covers to block the movement of my head but boom!  Bright fluorescence shined on me again!  However, if it hadn't been for that it is a safe hostel in a superb",2,1
"I stayed here 5 nights in June.  The location is great. Right outside central park, near the subway and just 10 minutes walking to Times Square. There is free Wifi in the common room downstairs and there is a small shop to get coffee or sandwiches. The sheets of the bed were clean.  The downside is that our room was really small, old and didn't look clean. The shower and toilets were old also. Make sure you wear slippers in the bathroom just to be safe.  When it was raining the drops on the AC unit kept us awake all night.   We chose to stay here for the price and location. Don't think I will come back here.",2,1
"Stayed here for two nights in June 2013. Never again! From the outside it looks like a construction site, walked in and checked in. Corridors were loud, dingy, and reminded me of a prison cell. Room opens with a card, which didn't work at first. Once I finally entered the room the first thing I noticed was the smell, it stunk of old stale wet fish. The room was musty and sweaty and the window didn't  open neither did the air con work. There were cracks in the floor as the door lock didn't work. There was a tv which was the only good thing about this room. The bed had a musty smell and the sheets didn't look clean so i ended up sleeping in a sleeping bag as i did t trust the covers. The showers as toilets are communal, and very small, closed in and the shower curtain is too small",1,1
"This hostel is located at Columbus circle in NY and I think location this hostel is really convenience to go all around Manhattan.  I had a terrible experience because of the people in the lobby. They mistook my reservations like 3times which lasted for my entire stay in this hostel, they didn't even apologize to me in spite of all of their fault. Besides they kept complaining or blaming about the messy even thought it was because of them.  I felt that the bathrooms were pretty nice. I saw cleaners cleaning up so often. But you should consider someone staying in this hostel might mess there up.  I had reservations for 2room: one for myself and my friend and another one for my friends. I kept asking them to get a single room because one of my friend left earlier but they",1,1
"I stayed at west side YMCA for a week on a shared bathroom level. Oh the horror. I have stayed in my fair share of dorms with shared bathrooms before but this was my least favourite. Firstly the showers, which offer zero privacy and next to no space to put your belongings. They are relatively clean but a little more than a shower curtain that doesn't pull the whole way across the shower is required in my book. Secondly, there was no window, and no exhaust fan! Meaning it was constantly steamy and smelly. We were staying here during some very warm days and the lack of fan and/or window in the bathrooms made it terribly unpleasant. The sinks were also quite dirty but that is to be expected with however many people on the floor sharing the one bathroom.  Aside from the bathrooms",2,1
"Where do I begin...  I got conjunctivitis from my stay here.. whether it was from the sheets or just the absolute filth on everything, I am just not sure.. but bloodshot and gooey eyes ensued  for 4 days after the second night.  The corridors absolutely stunk, not sure what of.. but whatever it was, has been there for a while. The room we booked was a double private.. turns out it was a bunk bed jammed in what looked like to be a cubbyhole, my sheets were not clean and there was someone elses hair on my pillow..  2 out of the 3 toilets in the girls bathroom didnt lock - showers were tiny and whatever you didnt want getting wet, you had to put outside on the sink.  The staff were OK to deal with, apart from the fact that  a) we werent told where the lounge, kitchen or bathrooms",1,1
"The staff at this location are great and do their best to deal with the difficult circumstances of a rundown building. The staff were understanding and did issue a refund for my last night when I had to check out one day early.  Housekeeping staff were very friendly and did a good job cleaning the rooms.  I would not recommend this to anyone I know...they should definitely warn prospective guests that their facilities are in terrible condition. I stayed in a room on the 10th floor and paid $100/night for a private room.  There was one shared bathroom for the entire floor, which has at least 40 guest rooms....there were only two shower stalls that were in working condition, the handicapped shower stall was out of service for the entire duration of my stay (3 nights)....half of",2,1
"I had booked the West Side YMCA for one week (a single room with shared bathroom for more than 90 GBP per night), based on earlier stays there. When I arrived I realized that the place has deteriorated a lot since a year ago: the room (on an ""unrenovated"" floor) was tiny and spare, with spots on the floor and walls; the TV was old and produced graint images; the ceiling light (the only one in the room) went off every few minutes (on a timer to save energy I guess); the radiators made a very loud noise. After the first sleepless night a group of Danish teenagers arrived who turned the entire floor into a chaotic playground: they shouted and slammed doors throughout the night and made the entire bathroom (in which only one tap worked) a garbage bin with paper towels and clothes",1,1
"NY friends said this was actually and ""upscale"" Y and was suppose to be very nice and super inexpensive by New York City standards.....NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I paid $95 a night rate, available only if booking online. This was higher than the lower rate of $75 a night because it supposedly came with a semi-private bath. One would think that mean perhaps two adjacent rooms sharing a bath. NO. It means a bathroom down the hall where you can lock the door, as opposed to a communal bathroom with no lock I guess.  The very, very tiny room had furniture from three decades ago, and it wasn't ""retro chic.""  There isn't a real mattress, only a box spring pseudo mattress.  The twin bed won't fit anyone over 6' comfortably.  The carpet looked to be so old it probably would need",1,1
"This was a pleasant enough place - and the staff were generally helpful. Good facilities in terms of food, wifi and proximity to Central Park, subway, Times Sq etc, but my room had an insect crawling on the floor on the first night and I then found it difficult to sleep. The bathrooms were very very basic, although we then used the gym's facilities on a lower floor and found this to be much better. The rooms were cleaned every day, and everything was run very efficiently, but I won't be returning - mainly as I prefer a private bathroom and slightly more comfortable surroundings. Very handy for those on a very tight budget though who want to experience New York.",2,1
"The location Is great! It is right near central park and many other attractions. Room was tiny, paint peeling, and the beds were uncomfortable. For just a little more we could've stayed in a nice hotel. They control the radiators so in the middle of the night it would get freezing cold! Also, you have to shower early in the morning or early evening or the shower will be cold. Lastly, we had our""do not disturb"" sign up and someone went into our room anyway. No harm done just fresh towels but we wanted or room left alone. I will say that it is a safe area and there is constant security and you must show your room key to get in so no vagrants.",2,1
"This Hostel is a piece of crab. The Restrooms are gross, the matresses are pretty uncomfortable and the Wifi didn't work for a whole weekend!!! The Personal called themselves stupid and unable to manage things.",1,1
"We stayed there for 2 nights in a private room/shared bathroom. The room was not clean, hair on the ground, the matrasses laid through, really bad. The shared bathroom smelled like urine, the Walk in showers don't provide privacy, no doors... It is next to South Central Park which is good, but that's about it.",2,1
"the worst hostel I've ever spent a night. We were on the eighth floor, the corridors were similar to Alcatraz, there is only one bathroom for about 150 rooms, with 4 showers, one out of order. The small room was full of dust, dirt, and the price paid was like a hotel. a nightmare",1,1
"My Sis and I stayed here as it was Probally one of the cheapest places, also the location right by park was amazing! Its also only a fun through the shops 20 min walk to times sq! although it was a bit cheaper the room still cost us 100 dollars a night for a tiny room with a bunk bed in and a tv (no bathroom). I think we were confused booking this as I thought the YMCA was a hostel but it's not, there's no kitchen, common room or laundry facilitys so for a back packer it's extra expensive eating out 3x day. The rooms are above a community centre and you share the lifts with people going to the gym and kids going to the pool! Very strange! We did get use of the pool but didn't use it as it was always full of school kids. Our room was quiet but boiling hot, the air con was too",2,1
"Avoid this place at all costs... You are better off sleeping on the streets, they are cleaner!  After making reservations months in advance, upon arrival, I waited in a line at the front desk for 45 minutes, only to be told they did not have the room I booked available due to the fact that they overbook the rooms. The rude front desk clerk by the name of Roman Vasquez said he would see what he could do, if anything, but said he would not make any promises and yelled, next person in line!  I waited another 45 minutes and inquired again on the status of the room and was told there was only a single room available... we booked a double room because there were two of us. There was no other place to stay due to the fact that it was fashion week and the September 11th memorial. So we",1,1
"I had a terrible experience here for 2 reasons. To me, the worse one was that I was treated poorly by one person named Roman Vasquez because I'm a gay male. I booked and PAID for a room for three nights and my card was deactivated by him before my stay was over.  I went down to the front desk to find out why and it was him! This wasted a lot of my time. The other thing is that I found a HUGE cockroach in my room. It was scurrying across the floor I kid you not! I'm really disappointed about my stay. If you don't mind being discriminated against by this individual, by all means stay here. He'll call security on you...seriously",1,1
My boyfriend booked a room for one night there and he thought we would have two beds so we could join it and sleep together :) however when we opened the door to our room I was shoked... It was extremly small and there was a bunk bed... Ac didn't want to change the tempurature and kept 73 F. The room... it looked very old with blue paint. They have a fridge which is good.... Next night we spent in a good hotel and I felt finally very happy to sleep in a nice place.,1,1
"Seriously, don't bother wasting your money. A friend and I were booked into the YMCA for a total of 5 nights...but we only lasted 1.On arrival it looked nice enough until we got through to the guest services desk and it was a dive!! The man behind the desk simply kept yelling at us ""wait! wait!"" as soon as we walked in and before we'd even said one word. He got even ruder after that and tried telling us we hadn't got a reservation, despite us having copies of the confirmation with us (not what you want after an 8 hour flight). He finally assigned us a room but didn't tell us anything more than the room number, luckily we're clever enough to figure out which floor we were on but it would have been helpful to know where we could buy breakfast from in the morning and which floor",1,1
"I had to spend two nights in Manhattan in June 2012.  I searched for a while to find someplace just to stay close to the Lincoln Center area and not break my budget.  I have to return in July 2012 for 4 days.  I decided to try the YMCA West Side; their webpage indicated they had refurbished rooms.  I rented a room with a bunk bed.  Once I checked in, I realized I had 1/3 of a room.  Well, it had a bed, desk, window AC unit which blew hot air all of the time, and a color TV which did not get good reception.  The curtain would not stay closed when the AC was turned on.  The room was about 10 x 7...yep, smaller than a prison cell it seemed.  :)  It was relatively clean for its condition and they brought fresh bath towels only (no wash cloths).  The bathrooms were community",2,1
"A roommate & myself planned to stay at the west end ymca for 18 days for an internship opportunity.  Unfortunately I had to leave early due to the passing of my grandmother.  I went downstairs to simply return my  room key before catching  a flight & was all downhill from there.  They refunded part of the room charge to me which was nice but I explained that my roommate wasn't leaving, she still needed the room.  They then tried to talk me into telling her to move to a single room and pay for the remaining cost herself.  Of course, I said no because that would be very unfair to her.  I asked them to remove the refund from my card & place it back towards the room so I could leave & my roommate could keep our same room.  They assured me this was taken care of so I left to be with",1,1
"Yes, we stayed there two nights and it was quiet, but we spent the double price they told us before!",2,1
"If you are a teacher in the UK, or taking young people, you should read the following. I am a History teacher from the UK and I took 80 students aged 14-16 here in April 2012. Despite doing an inspection visit in October to the YMCA and addressing with them issues about graffiti, health and safety of bedrooms (windows being wide open and no ladders to climb up high bunks) and sharing floors with other travellers none of these were addressed. However they realised this and refunded our school £660 and £250 off our next visit. However we won't be staying here again. The travel company, NST, booked us in here for maximum profit for themselves.  NEGATIVES = The rooms are too shabby, comparable to a hostel for homeless people in the UK or a very run down youth hostel. The bathrooms",2,1
"I had a single room, witch was good enough for me but not clean enough! There was a shared bathroom but it was discusting! Also the cleaning people has sniffed in my luguagge! I had also a problem on the last evening to get in my room, access was denied because they made a mistake when i did my check in! The staff was very rude! So for me this was the first and the last time that I'v booked this!",1,1
"I booked this hostel with a little bit of doubt. Due to the fact that the opinions of the hostel guests where so inconsistent I did not know what to expect.  I stayed at the top floor in a room that was OK clean. Could be better, could be worse. It was kinda strange that the window did not close and that the airconditioning was hanging outside --> which gave a hurrandance noise when it was raising. It was practically not duable to get to sleep if it was raining. I did find a cockroach wing in my room, but frankly from the start I would have been surprised if I did not. The house keeping changed my bedsheets and towel every day. The bathrooms at the top floor are private and clean. There were I guess 12 single bathrooms with everything in it. If it wasn't clean you just simply",2,1
"Nice location, but if this were located in pretty much any other American city, the health department would shut it down. The bathrooms are third world, and not GOOD third world. They are completely, utterly disgusting. The Y should be ashamed of itself. Bleach doesn't cost that much. DO NOT EVER STAY HERE!!!",1,1
"the place is probably good for teenagers/students and people on a very low budget but personally i had a depressing time there and would not recommend it to anyone who looks for some decency. i was mislead, when choosing to book here, by the description on their website: ""single de lux room on our newly renovated floor with semi-private bathroom"", which came at 115 usd per night. the room was in fact very basic, similar to a poorly maintained student room on an average campus. the walls were dirty and stained. the hallways to the room were horrible, painted in a strong yellow. the bathrooms were on the hallway and not necessarily clean (true, this also depends on the people who use them). there was no sink in the room, though i somewhat thought that ""semi-private"" bathroom would",1,1
"You pay for what you get I suppose, although we didn't expect to share our room with an ant infestation.. I also cut my foot on a shard of metal sticking out from one of the bunk beds.  Complaints aside, the location was great, just over the road from Central Park and the views from the hostel were pretty decent.",2,1
This is the worst hostel I have stayed in. The room was freezing and the radiator was broken. The girl on the front desk was very unhelpful. They sent a serviceman up to our room to fix the radiator but he couldn't fix it. Instead of moving us to another room he used one of our towels to try to block off the vents where cold air was blowing in to our room. We had a shared bathroom which was filthy and the shower curtains don't fit so everyone in the room can see into your shower. Went back to the bathroom the next day and they still hadn't been cleaned. Only good thing about this place was that they gave us our money back so that we could stay somewhere else,1,1
"Stayed here over new year and in terms of quality you really do get what you pay for. The room was small, and the bed creaky. The shared bathrooms were truly awful, with a flimsy shower curtain separating you from the world.  The corridors have an air of foreboding that would be inspirational if you were Stephen King, but otherwise are just plain creepy!  Staff aren't up to much, pretty blunt and not interested in anything but the basics!  Having said all that, the location is second to none. 1 minute from Central Park, 10 minutes from Times Square. And at Christmas and New Year you really can't put a price on that!",2,1
"Having read the reviews on here before i left i did not expect to be staying in very good accommodation. I shall start with the service. The people in the ymca were not very polite and were quite blunt. The cleaners looked dodgy. As for the facilities, where do i start! The bunk beds were not stable at all and me and the my room mate had to take the bed apart in fear that the bed could not take two 14 stone men. I also had several stains on my pillow, which was not too pleasant. The tv made funny noises all the time when it was turned off but other than that the rooms were fine... My worst problem were the bathrooms! The toilets had too much water in them therefore there was a 'splash back' whenever you went to the toilet. On one of my visits there i found a cockroach in the far",1,1
"After a wonderful semester in the USA and lots of traveling within this amazing country, my friends and I decided to end this wonderful experience in New York City. After staying in several hostels the last weeks, the one better than the other, this one is by far the worst. Better said, it's the worst place I've ever been.  When I wanted to check in after midnight (I called them and sent 3 e-mails about my late arrival, due to a delayed train from Virginia), the security guard refused to let me in. I was walking in with all my luggage (5 months of personal belongings, lots of suitcases) and he was just staring at me struggling with this and shouting at me that I couldn't put it at the place I was collecting it. Then when I wanted to check in, he told me in a very rude way that I",1,1
"After reading some horrific reviews before our visit, the expectations were poor an this hostel well an truly lived up to them, if not, shocked us even more.This was an educational visit, with 20 or so of us, each on floor 9 or 11. To start the first night off with a blast, we had a continous disco running from 11pm to 8 o clock the next morning where the lights in our bedroom decided to go on and off every 5 minutes.... providing us with a complete lack of sleep. After this issue supposidly being resolved, this still happened atleast a few times each night. Couldnt fault the rooms TOO much for the money, they were box sized, with bunk beds, dull and could do with a good lick of paint... slightly dirty but  could of been worse. But as for the toilet an shower area... filthy,",1,1
"Well, what can I say. It's pretty crap to be honest.  I never chose the hotel as I was with a group so I had no idea what I was getting into.  To be fair to the place it does have some good things. It has WI-FI downstairs. I actually managed to connect from my room so that was a bonus. There was also an AC unit that looked brand new! I stayed on the 11th floor. The view from my room was..... well there wasn't a view. All I could see were other rooms as the hostel is in a U shape. The room did actually have a TV and a desk. Now, i'm quite tall and the top bunk was unreachable. I had to throw myself up there. The room was also really dirty.  The bathroom. OH GOD! It was communal. (being from the UK communal bathrooms are pretty much banned. Everything has an en-suite.) There were",2,1
"Just returned from a two night stay. The location is great, which is the only thing this hotel has going for it. I have previously stayed on the LES for closer to $150 a night but decided to give this a shot.  The YMCA doesn’t even make it to the level of “student hostel” style accommodations. The room was tiny,  the furniture very old, the furniture was minimal (vinyl tile floor, flimsy mattresses, bunks with no ladders or railings).  The shared bathrooms were perpetually filthy. They seemed to be cleaned only once a day, which was not adequate for the number of people using them. They were sopping wet, covered in detritus of use, out of paper towels, and lacking any place to keep a towel or clothing dry while showering. The lock on the outside of the woman’s bathroom did not",1,1
Rooms were terrible. Beds are the worst I have ever slept. Rooms and bathrooms were not clean. Air conditioning was installed so bad that lots of rain get into room. Internet was only accessible at ground flor of hotel. Only the location of hotel was good. It is very close to Central Park I advise everybody to pay little more extra to stay at a better hotel,1,1
"I was thrilled when I booked this room for such a great price. The location was nearly perfect & I wasn't looking for a fancy room. I just wanted someplace where I could throw my stuff & occasionally sleep.  I was traveling alone and came back late one evening. Up until this point my experience was fine. I had lost my key on the subway and tried to explain this to one of the YMCA's security staff. I had my I.D. on me and showed it to him. I also offered to pay for the key, since it was my fault I had lost it. Instead of looking up my room or making a new key, the staff stared at me like I was speaking a foreign language. It took me OVER AN HOUR to get into my room. I had to be escorted by one of the guards who then pinned me in my room once we had arrived.   I had given my",1,1
"I made a last minute decision to go to Manhattan. After checking ""Bed Bug Reports for New York City"" and ""Tripadvisor"", decided to stay at the West SideYMCA for three days. I only needed a place to sleep since I would be gone all day and the price was very tempting. Also I wanted a place to swim. I arrived early and parked in the parking lot next door for $40 per day, let my bag with security for $1 and proceeded to go to the MoMA. Check-in was easy and I was given a room on the 10th floor. When I got off the elevator, it smelled like skid row. (Urine and musty) When I got to my room, I was surprised that someone would rent a dirty room to someone. The bed was clean and the  TV and AC working.  When they said shared bathroom, I didn't realize that it was down the hall; but I",2,1
"The YMCA is in a fantastic location, however, beware that it has a number of permanent residence including what seems to be a mens shelter on the 8th floor. The bathrooms were disgusting and the rooms tiny and dirty. The 8th floor was home to a number of old (and senile) men who looked as though they should be in an aged care facility rather than a YMCA. The bathrooms were disgusting and smelt terrible and the showers only include a curtain, which allows senile old men to watch as you shower (this sounds funny but it did happend to me at the West side YMCA and was my worst experience since we started to travel in February). The hotel staff were generally friendly and helpful, however the YMCA is is cheap for a reason. Never again!",1,1
The bathrooms smelt of wee all week and if you can manage not to gag from the smell while in the shower then you might not mind the cockroaches. The bedrooms are small but manageable. Most of the staff were rude and unhelpful although one or two were good.,1,1
"Possibly the worst place to stay ever. The price is low for a reason and don't be tempted by it! As soon as we arrived, the rooms and corridors smelt of smoke and in the bathrooms there was cockroaches underneath the radiators and bins! There were stains on the sheets and many of the TV's didn't work. Don't put yourself through it and it wont be the worth the money you payed to stay there. It has a good location and gym, however, that is all, unfortunately.",1,1
Everything was okay nothing great. Do not fell safe at all. The rooms are very small with bunk beds no ladder. Close to central park and subway. The street its located on is very scary. The cost is to much for the value. Security is very nice but not very good. Front desk people are not very nice.,2,1
"This was our first stop on a 3 month trip to the US. We stayed here for 7 nights at the beginning of March 2011, and from the very beginning our experience at West Side YMCA was negative.   After being in transit for approximately 30 hours, we arrived to check in and were 'greeted' by a very rude staff member, who seemed completely disinterested in what she was doing. We experienced the same attitude from all members of staff during our stay.  Our room was very basic (and we had paid extra for a premium room). The floor was very dirty and looked as though it had not been cleaned in quite a while. I actually didn't feel comfortable walking on the floor without shoes on. The area around the air conditioner on our window had not been sealed properly; as a result, our room was",1,1
"I am a 17 year old guy went to New York YMCA with the School to enjoy our break before our exams. When we first got there, we all found that the hostel bedroom was very filthy and dusty. The bunk bed has no ladder and the top bed was higher than me. I am am 6 feet tall. We didnt feel that safe because we couldnt lock the door. Most of our Air Conditions were not working as the room is boiling hot and it stinks really badly. There seem to be a lot of strange and weird people including peadophiles who approached 2 of us. One was in the swimming pool area as a 60 year old ask a boy if he wants to go to the master bedroom. This  also happened to me as a guy aged 75 was staring at me in the shower. We would not go back and our school wouldn't go back.",1,1
"I stayed here 3 years ago for 5 nights and found the place to be clean and comfortable.  The fact Central Park is pretty much across the road is a bonus. Was going to be in NYC for the marathon so decided to stay here the first night so that I could go for a run in the park first thing. My flight arrived late in the evening and got the the YMCA after 10pm.  Had to wait whilst someone else was seen and then it was my turn to be ""greeted"" by the totally uninterested desk clerks.  Whilst I was been seen, someone asked if he could get hot water anywhere for a drink, and after being told to use the tap, a snide remark was made about ""What do you expect for $100 a night?) It took a good 5-10 minutes before I was given the key to my room with private bathroom on the 9th floor for $169.",1,1
"All I wanted was a private room with a bed to sleep in, being out and doing tourist things 8am - midnight every day, so the Y was fine.  The location was perfect, right on central park and close to subway stations etc.  However, for the price there are nicer places not much further away if you book in advance and look for specials.  The bed wasn't amazing, but good enough.  The room was sufficiently large.   Pros:  Great location.  Helpful staff.  Cafe downstairs was okay.  I got good, quiet sleep and wasn't disturbed.  Could come and go at any time without hassle.  Air con and heating in room, linen and towel service.  Wasn't too noisy.  It felt safe and secure.  Cons: Much better amenity available elsewhere in this price range.  Shared bathrooms not great; some on my floor had",2,1
"This was the first and last time I will be staying in a hostel. You certainly get what you pay for. It is cheap and well located and for a short stay checking out all the sites New York has to offer it is fantastic.   But it is very uncomfotable. Horrible, small rooms with cold tiled floors. The shared bathrooms are extremely disgusting (shared between around 20 rooms per floor) and unclean. Take your flip flops for the toilet and the shower!  I would encourage you to pay a bit more and stay somewhere nicer as this hostel is like living in poverty.",2,1
"Walked into the YMCA after using different good ones in the past and was greeted by a surly person at the reception counter and a rude person at the check-in. Charged for leaving luggage in an open room with no security so don't know why they justify charging. Charged for internet use when every other place we stayed in on the way up from Kentucky was free, (in cheaper accommodation). The room was a disgrace with paint peeling off the ceilings and wall, the air conditioning unit didn't work and when I tried to turn it off as it looked a little bit dangerous it wouldn't allow me too just making a whining sound without throwing out any cold air.      The shower rooms were dirty not due to the fact of not being cleaned but just not being maintained by replacing broken tiles etc.",1,1
"Myself and my teenage son had booked this place through our travel agent who said it was a good place to lay your head at night, because that was all we would probably be doing there. He was close to the truth !!!!!. The cleanliness was appalling with a dirty towel left lying on the landing for the whole of our 5 night stay, used toiletries left in the ""shared"" bathrooms even after so called cleaners had done there bit. The launderette advertised on the leaflets given to us on arrival was non-existent and the bedroom floors never saw the slightest glint of a mop head. If you want a cheap place and not bothered about the cleanliness then this is the place for you but not for me.",2,1
"The summary of what follows is: you might be tempted, but do not stay here.  The deluxe single rooms are moderately pleasant; they have whitewashed walls, blonde wooden furniture and adequate shelves and space for hanging clothes.  The YMCA’s traditional linoleum floor covering and strip fluorescent lighting has been replaced by a soothing sage coloured carpet (albeit it of the “hose down” variety), a soft overhead light and a table lamp.   The quality of the people you have to deal with at the West Side YMCA vary.  The front desk staff are totally impersonal, look right through you and are robotically polite.  The security guards are obnoxiously rude and manifest nothing but disdainful contempt for the customers.  The cafe staff are so charismatic and joyful, and their coffee",1,1
"We have stayed at the Vanderbilt Y previously and generally know what to expect, but this was our first stay at the West Side Y because of the location and the things we wanted to do in the area.  The location on 63rd Street near Central Park, Lincoln Center  and Julliard is fantastic and the cost for 2 including tax was only $102, a bargain for NYC.  After reading the reviews, I expected it to be worse that it was.  The rooms for 2 have bunk beds in a relatively small space, the TV is hung on the wall and worked fine (the Vanderbilt Y TVs never seemed to work right).  There is a desk and chair--no chest of drawers for clothes, but there was a closet (which the other Y did not have) to hang clothes and there were extra blankets.  The mattress was adequate, but the pillow was",2,1
"On the bright side you are seconds from Central Park, Trump Tower, Lincoln Plaza etc - five stars for location. The gym is also well equipped and the staff are brilliant - making it a great bonus for the stay at the Y.  The room I'm staying in on the other hand seems straight out of a public hospital ward. As soon as the doors to the lift open on level the whift of something horrid greets you. Walking down the corridoor the carpets are stained and the walls aren't much better.  The room itself doesn't smell but the double bed seems exceptionally small and feels more like a table, the toilet gives you a workout when trying to push the handle to flush it, the hot water for the shower seems harder to find than a ticket to the most popular ticket on Broadway, and the television is",2,1
"Stayed here for two nights. The location is great, I've always been a west side person so I loved the location. Can't say the same about the rooms though. My basis is the Vanderbilt YMCA which I stayed at several months ago.  The rooms are definitely lower quality, no carpeting, only a closet for your stuff with no drawers. The bathrooms however are the worst, the showers, sinks and toilets were frequently clogged and dirty, sometimes with water overflowing. I did mention it to the front desk but I was already on my way out.   The wifi is available only at the lobby, not at the rooms. Someone already mentioned about their left luggage which is in an unlocked room. Again different from the Vanderbilt where they have a locked room for luggage.  Most hotels eg. the Jane or the Pod",2,1
"See at the bottom for recommendations for better places to stay.  This is a hostel, which explains the lack of room amenities, I suppose: no clock, hair dryer, bathroom kit, blanket, robe, or sink in the room, for instance.  But it doesn't explain the other problems:  Check-in took a very long time (while the clerk debated with a colleague whether the room was clean and ignored me; I had arrived 45 minutes after check-in time).  The clerk never apologized or thanked me for waiting, and declined to hand me the key even after I said that I needed to get to the room and then leave, and that I  didn't care if the room wasn't clean yet.  My room was on the  9th floor, and the clerk wrote down a 3-digit number and ""bathroom,"" but failed to tell me that this was a code, not a room",2,1
"The price/quality levels are ridiculous for this hotel, but I guess this is typical of NYC as we couldn't find anything with better reviews for the same price. But it is definitely very overpriced.   The room is very small with a bunk bed and a small desk. There is a closet in the wall and a TV hanging from the ceiling. There is no space to sit except for on the bottom bed, but the top bed is too low to be able to sit comfortably. Can sit on the top bed but not easy getting up and off there!   This is a hotel to arrive late, sleep and get out of your room asap in the morning.   First few nights we had the shared bathroom, where there are some showers opposite the wash basins. The showers only have curtains, no doors and are very small so no privacy. Hard to get dressed without",2,1
"Depressing institution.  The airco was noisy and broken. I paid for the upgrade to the upper floors with a private bedroom shared bath. The T.V did not work. I asked to fix it or change it. Nothing was done to solve my problem.  It rained and the water leaked in my ceiling onto the bed.  The toilets were very dirty full of hair and dirty tissue on the floor, so I took advantage of the free gym pass and used the gym showers on the 3rd floor. The showers are an open room with 10 showers heads and has no private shower room. the steam room was seedy. it is for exhibitionists. Think twice before booking the west side YMCA unless you are ok with dirty room, noisy corridors and a totally depressing decor. There is no place for a coffee or to eat on the premises. You can walk out and",1,1
"I stayed at YMCA West Side for 4 nights in October. I arrived in NYC on my own and I'd never been there before. I booked in the YMCA as I could not find any reasonably priced hotel accommodation in Manhattan. The place is extremely depressing -I didn't mind the tiny room or unpleasant shared lavatories -this does reflect the price after all, which is seriously cheap for New York. But it did feel more like being in jail or a psychiatric clinic than a hostel. I was hoping that, as I was traveling on my own, I'd have a chance to meet some people there. The cafe was closed for refurbishment though and there was no place to chill out with others or get a  coffee in the building. The internet connection that was supposed to be free at the foyer did not work either. All in all, good",2,1
"The stay at this hotel was horrible... Bathroom wasn't working, and showers were not really clean. The AC were noisy so it wasn't possible to sleep correctly. I really don't advise this hotel!!",1,1
"We stayed at the YMCA for four nights in September during a longer visit to New York. This place has both its advantages and disadvantages: It's in a really good location - literally a stone's throw from central park and it doesn't take very long to get to areas such as Times Square.  We paid $110 a night to stay in a 'premium' bunk bed room for two people. I later found out that 'premium' rooms are on one of the two refurbished floors of the hostel, and there's nothing different about the rooms as such, from what i could gather. There is also apparently more bathrooms for people staying on this floor. But this was actually, it turned out, a major down point of the hostel. On the cheap floors, you get a bathroom with a number of showers within it. however, on this floor (12th)",2,1
"As I visited New York with my school I knew I wasn't going to get anything posh maybe that's why I wasn't as shocked when I saw my room. A box is basically what you get as well as a squeaky bunk bed, a ""wardrobe"", a tv, a flashing light, a desk, an actually decent AC and a ""window"", what more can you ask for? ... SPACE (and maybe a sink!). I wasn't against the idea of having a communal shower but I was 100% against the idea of a dirty shower. The bathroom regularly smelled and stained of urine and the sinks were incredibly shoddy, you'd feel dirtier having showered in there. People recommended the swimming pool showers but as my friend could not even find the swimming pool I lost hope. The service is poor, normally I have little to comment on this but as I stupidly locked my",2,1
"I chose to stay here just to have a place to sleep before taking an exam in the city the following morning. The room was very small and basic but I have no complaint with that. I just wanted a bed. There are bathrooms with wheelchair access - but that is useless if no one can find a key that opens them. At check-in I wa given a key for the disabled access bathroom - a regular key, not the sliding card type. But this key did not fit anything on my floor (12th). The disabled access bathroom needed a card key to open. But my room key would not open it. It would only open the regular bathrooms (which thankfully were big enough to get in and use the toilet, although there were no grab bars around the toilet). Staff could not figure out how to get in the wheelchair bathroom. In the",2,1
I travelled to New York for a long weekend with my boyfriend and to start off there was a limited choice of rooms available so we settled for a bunk room which meant we had to sleep in seperate beds. The room itself didn't matter so much because we were not there to be spending time in our room. The air-conditioner worked at least. The bathroom however.... we I understand it's a hostel but they didn't stay clean for long after being cleaned and of the 3 showers only 2 of them worked. This was especially irritating when the cleaners would come each morning (at a time when people want to use the showers) and clear everybody waiting out so they could clean. It was a pain to wait for them to finish cleaning as it cut into the day.,2,1
"The only good thing about this place is the location, it is well situated in the centre of NYC. Having said that, if you don't mind sleeping in a tiny bunk-bed room with broken windows and full of cockroaches and a lot of noise than this is the place for you! Apart from that, the toilets are the worst of all as you share with the whole floor (probably over 50 rooms!) and it is in such a dirty condition that you have to use the ""3 second rule"" every time something falls on the floor! The staff are rude and very unhelpful; our room was broken into the first night and we had to change rooms at 12 midnight for security reasons. What's worse, as we reported the incident the morning after to the security manager, his reply was: What do you want me to do about it? I think that pretty",1,1
"A school trip a group consisting of myself and 20 17-18 year olds from ENFIELD.. we stayed at this hostel for 4 days. We were on the 11th floor. The rooms were TINY. Creaky bunk beds with floorspace just for one suitcase. The beds were reassuringly clean, although the hostel itself did not itself look like the cleanest of places. I suppose it is somewhere ok to stay if you spend the least amount of time in it- if you just use it to sleep in. Its steps away from central park and overall a great location if you want to explore NYC. But the toilets were FILTH. They were unable to flush and obviously if everyone on that floor had used the toilet you can imagine the stench and disgusting view you had when you tried to go toilet. It was unnacceptable, the showers were cold and BELIEVE",2,1
Im aware that this review may seen a bit harsh but this is genuinely the worst place I have ever stayed in in my life! We travelled there as part of a school tour in April 2009. First of all the bathrooms! The toilets would not flush and were full to the brim  with yellow and brown water! Pages of pornography littlered the bathroom floor and once or twice I stood on semen covered tissue paper on the floor! The smell was atrocious! The showers gave no privacy and the shower curtain didnt even cover half the shower! I  had to wake up  at 1-2am to get some privacy in the showers! The staff were the most unfriendly people I have ever met in my life! They were rude and arogant and very unhelpful! The walls were paper thin so when Itried to get asleep  at night you could hear people,1,1
"Deluxe rooms are not worth the price.  I have stayed in the regular rooms on a number of occasions and have never had reason to complain – they have always been worth the price.  The location is perfect – that’s all I was really paying for when I stayed in a standard room.  But as I would be staying five nights on this trip I opted to pay an extra $25 per night – mostly in order to have a ‘semi-private bathroom’ instead of the standard shared bathroom, which provides no privacy.  The semi-private bathrooms are indeed semi-private.  One thing to note however, is how few of them they are.  The literature provided upon check-in stated that there were 11 bathrooms on each floor – on my wanderings around the twelfth floor I found a row of half a dozen of them.  The bathrooms are all",1,1
"I only stayed here for four days and three nights and it wasn't hugely pleasing. I found that generally, the staff were very polite and willing to help and most areas on the lower floors were very well kept. The upper floors however were a different story. When i got to my floor it felt like a prison block - there were lots of very small rooms crammed onto one floor and decoration was limited. My room had a bunk, a dressing table with mirror, a t.v and a closet. The bunk was on castors, impossible to get in to, had no ladder, no rail to stop you falling out and pretty much had its own imagination. The closet was tricky to hang things as only 4 hangers were supplied and the shelves were far too high to reach. Other things i noticed were that the window frames and window sill were",2,1

The rooms were very small, and the bunk beds were not practical at all. one of the stuednts found fleas in their bed and was even more shocked to see that they were still there the next day! Obviously the maid service was not up to standard! This sort of accomadation would be adaquate for one night, possibly two but when you are staying longer than that its unaceptable. The shared bathrooms were a disaster! There is a line between not being very pleasant and being",1,1
I had to transfer to this hostel because I could not stay at my other hotel.  I hated every minute of it.  The room was small and grubby and the wash rooms unclean and the toilets did not flush.  I couldn't wait to get out of there and would never recommend anybody staying there unless it was the last place in NY to find a bed.  The hostels in China were better and cleaner than that place,1,1
Don't ever come here! Toilet stinks strongly of urine. Concierge was rude and unhelpful when I wanted to ask for directions. Not worth it at all!,1,1
"The floor you stay on seems to be very important, so for the record I was on the 9th in a single room with a linoleum floor, double bed, cable TV, desk, chair and AC.  The location is fabulous as others have said, but I thought the primary concern is getting a good sleep. Afterall, if you dont get a good, restful sleep, your whole NYC experience will suffer as a result. In that regard, the accomodations were a little lacking.  -noise. Very loud slamming of doors, guests talking in hallways, cleaning staff vacuuming at 8:00AM, etc. Some say this is a ""dorm experience"", but my experience in college was actually far quieter in comparison, at least during sleeping hours.  Some have said to use earplugs, but if you're like me, the sound of no noise and the new sensation of having",2,1
"We stayed at this facility one year ago, and had a pleasant stay consistent with what we expected from a facility one step above a hostel.  Cheap, but clean.  Basic amenities with bathroom down hall for about 45 bucks per night per person.  Food was available down on the ground floor at decent rates.  Flash forward to this year.  Apparently the facility was under new or different management.  Our rooms were just basically filthy, with burned out light bulbs, an unusable television, a dirty floor, and a dead rat in the bathroom.   No hooks or racks for clothing, really disgusting.   I started using the bathroom in the lobby, as did my daughter.  Also, the food prices had more than doubled.  $3.50 for a bowl of dry cereal.  Later we were told we were on the least desirable floor,",1,1
"I stayed at the West Side YMCA for two nights on one of their non-refurbished floors. The location is excellent and comes at a fair value, while there are a few issues that you might want to consider, particularly when travelling on a budget and aiming for the lower-end bunk bed rooms.  The room I shared with my friend was very small but functional and was cleaned every day. We stayed away from the elevator in a relatively quiet area. The corridors on our floor were dark and a little smelly.  Men's shared bathrooms on my floor were a mess - very dirty with an obtrusive smell of urine, as if they hadn't been properly cleaned for weeks. Women's shared bathrooms came with a key code lock, which is great per se, but says much more about security at this place. There where weird,",2,1
"I first stayed here 10 years ago in 1998 when travelling with some university friends. When returning to NYC for the first time with my fiance as part of a longer trip, our restricted budget made me decide to stay here again. In many ways I wished I had left this with my other memories of being 19 as returning as a 29 year old wasn't that great an experience.  The first mistake was not booking a room directly with the hostel but booking it online. Online I was shown a picture of a double room, in reality we got bunk beds as there are no double rooms. We also stayed in a cheaper room on one of the unrefurbished floors. I did see a room & a bathroom on one of the other floors, but in the end opted not to spend another $100 upgrading, it just didn't seem worth it.  On the plus",2,1
"This was our second time staying here, on a group trip both times, and in rooms on the ""premier"" floors (12th and 13th).  The elevators are now high-speed, which is a huge improvement over before, but I didn't see much evidence of the other guest room renovations mentioned on the Y's website.   The shared bathrooms are a pain even if you're used to that kind of arrangement. They don't stay clean very long (even though the cleaning staff do a great job), there are no fans in them so anytime you take a shower it gets unbearably hot and steamy, and, at least on our floor, the room keys weren't keyed for all the bathroom doors, just a couple. So if you wanted (or needed!) to use the bathroom and the ones that matched your key were occupied, you would have to wait even if other",2,1
"I stayed at the YMCA for 5 nights at the beginning of December.  Good points: - The location was excellent, 30 seconds from central park and about 5 minutes (or less) from a subway station with all the main trainlines running through. - Sheets, towels, etc were all provided and were very clean! - Good security with receipts for left baggage and 24 hour reception (after hours through security guard) - There was only one set of showers & toilets for each floor but I didn't have to wait more than a couple of minutes.  Not so good points: - It was a bit worn down and dingy, looked as though it needed some renovations!  The floor in my room looked dirty but I saw cleaners most days in the hostel so I think it was just old. - Water was variable: they had problems with the hot water so",2,1
"I stayed at the West Side Y.M.C.A. for four night recently and thought it was terrific value and in a great location. We arrived after midnight, and were greeted by a courteous, and helpful man, and given directions to our room on the 9th floor. We had already seen photos on this website of the rooms, so we weren't suprised by how small they are or the bunk beds! The room was clean and warm, with soap and soft towels provided. The bunks were comfortable, and the sheets and pillows clean. The bathrooms were another story, only one Ladies bathroom for the whole floor. It was mostly dirty, with blocked loos. A real nightmare. Luckily we were out most of the time, so a quick shower was just about all you could manage here. The West Side enjoys a fabulous location, right on the",2,1
"If you do not mind waiting 20 minutes to use the bathroom in the morning this might be okay. Stayed on the 12th floor (newer floor) room tiny felt like I was in a cell.  Window filthy, thin matress covered in plastic, tile on floor cracked. This might be okay if you are out of school less than one year. Only plus location great are of NYC walk to Lincoln Center, Central Park South and the cross central park bus M66.",1,1
"I had spent two nights in this terrible hostel for US $ 106 per night staying at the 10-th floor with a crazy idea in mind to save some money. The room was very small and dark having an appearance of a trench rather than of living quarters. It had a tiny fixed window, untidy walls and a squalid built-in wardrobe. The door latch was broken. The blanket was ragged. The light was very poor. The TV set looked shabby. No TV distance control panel was available. It was necessary to pass about 60 yards to go to the shared bathroom with dirty showers, sinks and lavatory cabins, which perhaps were used to be cleaned once a day only in the best case. I saw people washing their clothes right in sinks! The water fall was weak, so that even washing of hands was problematic. Soundproofing of",1,1
"Yes the location is ideal (as everyone has said previously).  The wife and I stayed here because the location is a perfect starting point for exploring Manhattan.  However if you don't spend at least 12-15 hours out and about as we did, you are gonna hate this place.   The men's bathrooms (you share one on the floor) are not filthy but they are certainly grubby (no shower heads on the 9th floor).  NEVER pay for internet access with your credit card (3 dollars minimum but the suddenly a ten dollar charge appears...but they are cool about reversing it) use cash instead. The staff were okay.   The rooms themselves are also grubby (9th floor room 934) after we checked in we noticed a suspicious brown smear on the wall next to the closet (which doesn't open all the way) and once we",2,1
"I would like to save others from having the same terrible experience we had at this YMCA. Yes, the location is great, right next to Central Park, but that doesn't outweigh the horrible accomodations.  The room is super tiny, old, dirty, really smelly and totally gross.  You share a bathroom with everyone on the same floor, including the street people that stay there. The halls smell like stale smoke, the elevators don't ever show up and your lucky if your key works in your room.  We spent one night at the YMCA and for the next night we drove off the island 15 minutes and found a beautiful hotel for $139.00 and it included breakfast.  We shopped around the city and couldn't find anything under $300.00 a night.",1,1
"I had always assumed hotels considered it bad policy to house guests in areas under renovation, but I was wrong.   We booked a two-day stay at the West Side's website expecting similar accommodations -- run-down, but clean and cheap -- to that I had experienced a few years ago.  Upon arriving at the Y we were taken aback to discover major renovations were in progress. Since I hadn't noticed any mention of this on the Y's website, I assumed it would have no impact on our stay. So, idiots that were, we  checked into a room on the unrenovated 11th floor after being assured the work concerned  some elevators several storeys below ours.  After our return from dinner, we noticed workers around one of the elevators on our floor. Although their noise was loud enough to be heard in our",1,1
"I stayed on the unremodeled 11th floor.  The room was about the size of a small single college dorm and was clean, but a dull and drab gray.  The bed was pleasantly firm.  The air conditioner needs to be replaced.  Presumably the remodeled floors are better.  The elevators were a nightmare.  The staff is friendly.  But you didn't come to the NYC for the YMCA's rooms, right?  You get what you pay for...and the location is 5*.",2,1
"I stayed at the YMCA West Side from 17th March-21st March 2007. After reading many reviews from Trip Advisor I was very apprehensive about staying at this hostel. I travelled with 21 other students from my sixth form along with 3 of my teachers. I stayed on the 11th floor.   ROOMS - Quite small - Relatively clean - Great heating system  You have to remember that you will only use your room for sleeping in and it was comfortable enough for that!  YMCA - Mice in the front entrance - GREAT location - Opposite Central Park - Has a little canteen which is great for buying water...only 50p! However, I would not recommend buying food in this place  Communal Bathrooms - A little grimy - Toilets would sometimes get blocked and overflow - Showers are relatively clean, however, the sinks",2,1
"Book the 11th floor!!! Beautifully renovated!  The rest is Alcatraz!   My six year old still is traumatised!  We found feces everywhere in the bathroom one night - on the walls, in the shower.  A cocroach in our room was found the first night!  One night a huge man was walking around the halls in his y-front underwear - scary!  It was sooooo bad!  We refused to use the feces bathroom and were given a key to heaven - there is a a couple of floors fully renovated and clean with private bathrooms!",1,1
"I came here with my sixth form In July 2006. We spent 3 nights in the YM and its safe to say that 3 nights was more than enough.  Upon arrival, we were already edgy about what our teachers had booked.  The front of the building was covered in scaffholding so it was obvious some maintainance work was being done.  After being given the key, my mate and I went to our room on the 11th floor.  It has to be said that the room was comparable with a prison cell.  There was a bunk bed on the left, a small space where you could stand up and a chair had been shoved in.  There were no drawers and only 1 cupboard, which would not open, however after a technique combining kicking the crap out of the door, but also pulling at the same time, it opened.  Furthermore, the window was a nightmare",1,1
1) The location is great 2) To stay in it for longer than 2 weeks is not okay (for me)  3) The single rooms are really really small 4) There are better hotels for less money 5) The shared bathrooms are not very private (small shower curtains) 6) The staff is okeey 7) Nothing got stolen 8) The view is beautiful 9) The Airco works 10) It is old/dirty/broken (depending on what floor/room),2,1
"Firstly I was really impressed with the location. Closest subway stop is columbus circle a sought after neighbourhood with great little shops etc.  So let me tell you that I had the worst stay of my life here at Westside YMCA. First of all, the girl at the front desk smart mouthed me when I told her I had paid on expedia that used the YMCA as a direct booking agent. She basically told me off and replied no that it wasnt a payment. When I asked her why then when I gave my credit card and had done so for other places had been charged for such. She said well she would have to charge it to the card anyway and if I had been charged twice it wouldnt be their problem. I said well I cant come back in and debate this with you, I live in Australia ! Oh well then not our problem again -",1,1
"Tips are to get a room on the 12th floor and ask for a view of the park. Otherwise, IMO, you don't get what you pay for. I paid $86/night for a 2-day weekend stay, which is cheap for Manhattan. My room was on the unrenovated 11th floor and it was a dive! Uncarpeted, old linoleum floors. Old paint on the walls that was chipped in spots. An uncomfortable bed. The community bathroom doesn't have any place to put your stuff while showering. If I had known this beforehand, I would have considered staying at the Bowery Whitehouse hostel, which is a real dive, but at least it's appropriately priced. HOWEVER, the West Shore Y is clean! Bedbugs are a real problem in New York right now but I didn't have any welts after getting up in the morning. I took a walk on the 12th floor and, like",2,1
"This hotel was cheap by New York Standards ($110US per night) and the location is excellent, right near central park and only a few blocks from Broadway and Times Sqaure.  It was a little noisy (from the other guests) so I would bring some earplugs.  We had no hot water in our private bathroom or in the shared one I went to on another floor on our first day.  These things I could cope with.  What pushed me over the edge was the mice!  I know that it's an old building and I have stayed in some bad places but mice in my room (and even in my backpack!) are a first.  We told front desk and they sent security up while we were out but our little ""visitor"" was back the next night.  Besides this though the room was small but adeqaute and clean and we did eventually get nice hot showers",2,1
"I booked a room at the Westside YMCA online for a $72.00 room.  I was supposed to get an e-mail confirmation but never did.  I called before my trip and she gave me a confirmation # to give to the desk when I arrived.    When I arrived at the Y & paid for the room I noticed it was $88., not the price I thought it was.  I asked about it saying maybe there was tax added or something and she said no.  Since I didn't have the confirmation papers in hand I wasn't sure WHY it was more but intened to check on it when I got back home.  I did and sure enough the room I booked was $72.00 not the $88.00 room.  I called YMCA and she basically told me, too bad, you accepted it at the time and didn't rectify it then.  She was curt and not customer friendly at all.    I got to thinking...this",1,1
"I thought this would be a good experience, but upon walking in and being harassed for simply being in the lobby by the security bozo at the desk, it went downhill from there.  By the way, don't listen to the reviewers who state that the security is top notch, I walked in numerous times without showing my key and even walked around without them even blinking an eye, they're just underpaid employees who like to bug you when they can to act all tough, make an actual complaint about loud music or weird creeps walking around and they shrug it off.  The YMCA Westside building is from the 1920's and by the looks and smell of it, it hasn't at all had much upkeep to it.  Paint has been sloppily splashed onto the metal, doorknobs and wood throughout the years, inviting a ""sloppy,",1,1
"I stayed there for 1 week in a single private room. I  found the location very promising as I read the other reviews. Was looking for a place for sleeping, but this place is not even suitable for that.  I did not expect too much, I am not picky, but for 70 $ per night at least no PAINT COMING OFF THE WALL, WINDOWS closing TIGHT and a room bigger than a SHUE BOX.  I catched there a terrible cold at night under the thin blanket because of wind and cold coming inside (there was no heating any more in april but it was snowing outside). I was ill for 2 weeks. The bed is on wheels, rolled each time away from the wall I sat up.  I would have refused to have television instead of having a tap in the room, had to walk every time to the common bath serving one floor with only 2 showers.",1,1
"I have stayed in the WS YMCA many times, mainly due to finance and availability, although if you phone, they tell you they've nothing, I turned up after phoning and always got a room. The rooms are tiny and basic. The restrooms are always almost flooded, but strangely empty considering the amount of people sharing. The noise from rooms around you can be a bit much, people scraping their chairs above you is really nippy. The things you cannot fault: The location, the feeling of being safe, the on-site restaurant, where you can watch everything being made, the community spirit and just to witness the real life going on about you, no falseness, fake smiles, if the staff don't feel like it, they don't. The security is reassuring, if you're not meant to be in there, you won't be. I",2,1
"The worst place I ever seen. The room was very small and dirty (found nails on the carpet). In the 7th floor, where we stayed, there was one rest room for 60 rooms with two toilets, one of them not working, lock damaged. The staff is very unfriendly, impersonal and unwilling to help. Not for human beings.",1,1
"Where to begin, where to begin? First off the bat, and it has been mentioned in another review...but the top floors and other floors are like two different hotels.   First, the general location of the Y, is good. 3 minute walk to a subway station, supermarkets and a Kinko's if you want reliable, but expensive internet connections. The staff on check in and check out were reasonable and friendly, and there is plenty of security. The neighbourhood is VERY safe.  As for the rooms: again, I have had the pleasure and displeasure of staying in both parts of the hotel. The top floors are single premium rooms. You get a room with carpet, a functional TV, paint, and adequate closet space. The rooms are not big, but they are comfortable and clean. The matresses are NOT the most",2,1

"We just recently returned from a wonderful trip to New York City. Everything and everyone was great to us but our accommodations were atrocious. We originally booked with the Vanderbilt YMCA months and months ago. After arriving at GCS and struggling with luggage we finally made it to the Vanderbilt only to be told we had actually booked with the West Side YMCA. This was not true! We didn't even know the West Side YMCA existed so how could we have booked with them. We had previously stayed at the Vanderbilt and for inexpensive accommodations they can't be beat IN NYC. We tried to reason with the clerk but, no, she insisted we had to stay at the West Side. There were five in our booking so I'm sure that it was easier for them to manipulate one reservation and free up five",2,1
"After much searching of websites etc we decided to stay in a private room at the West Side. Our experience was mixed.On the positive side, the YMCA is very central, located just 4 blocks from Columbus Circle and half a block from Central Park. The room was very spartan and not very large but ultimately the bunk beds were comfortable and the pillows and sheets were impeccably clean.The shared bathroom facilities were very ordinary and need work. For US$80 a night, I would recommend you look elsewhere but if nothing else is available, this place should be OK.",2,1
"While waiting on an apartment to open, I stayed at the YMCA. My company was footing the bill on a weekly basis. When checking in, I was asked why I was staying, how long I anticipated being there, and was sort of disappointed at the lack of friendliness despite the fact that this was, after all, NYC. (It's not what Y's are supposed to be like) My room was on an upper floor near the end of a dark hallway. The room was small, but had an adequate closet and despite the shabby furnishings, it was a place out of the cold, so I wasn't complaining.  I ended up being there three weeks. During that time, I realized I shared the room with roaches (enough of them that they should have been paying part of the rent) and some other small little black bugs that I didn't identify.

Two functioning of three TVs ( two small ones by beds and a larger one on the wall. One remote turned on both TVs with a slight delay so the remote control was doing something different on each.

I’ve been to the Paul before and it was a modest but acceptable hotel considering the pandemic has shut most hotel services down in most hotels. We stayed a second time last week and when we arrived there was a space heater in the room. I immediately checked the heat and it wasn’t working. A maintenance person restarted it but it still wasn’t working. I asked for a second heater and a couple of blankets but after repeated requests someone came and gave us one blanket that was extremely soiled. When we asked for a clean one we were told that’s all they had. We asked to speak to the manager and we’re told they didn’t work on weekends. We left a detailed message for them but haven’t heard back.    The hotel also was not clean in general. We wiped things down ourselves.  I would,1,1

We had been alerted to the problem with the TRYP hotel before we left to drive to NYC, and a person named John Smerna or something similar promised us that the replacement hotel would be “great” and “we would love it” because it was “a 4 star hotel” (maybe a few years ago?) just like TRYP.

6 days ago I had contacted The Paul Hotel front desk in order to confirm whether or not I had left my drivers license accidentally at the front desk when I checked in to the hotel about a week and a half ago. At which time “Ali” had answered and within a few minutes immediately told me that the “lost and found department” was not currently working and that I would have to call back the next morning to speak to them on looking to see if they have it.  The next morning I called back The Paul Hotel to once again be answered by Ali who after placing me on a brief hold of about 10 minutes came back to the phone to tell me he found it in the lost and found card section and that I could come pick it up at the Hotel. I had told Ali at that point that I am unable to drive the 2 hours,1,1

But my biggest issue is the lack of poor management by hotel manager and horrific customer service.  I had laundry that needed to be cleaned abs placed it in the provided laundry bags. I asked the housekeeper where I should bring it to get them cleaned.  The housekeeper offered to take them herself.

I was then told that the room I had booked six weeks earlier was not available for part of the stay, so we would have to move. The rooms themselves are barely Ikea-furnished and are cleaned haphazardly, with piled-up dirt in the bathroom corners.

As soon as I knew which hotel I got, I went to TripAdvisor to check photos and reviews. And a lot of reviews (especially newest ones) were very bad. Two main reasons of complaints were super tiny rooms and bad hotel staff. Right after reading the reviews and some additional exploring, I tried to call to the hotel to request a bigger room with 2 Queen beds, because one of my relatives was going to join me later.

I called 24 hours in advance and tried to move my booking to the next night. They said they would approve it as long as the 3rd party sent them a note to approve.

I don't think anyone works there! Will definitely not recommend as I'm in the travel industry,1,1
"Rooms really dirty and unsanitized, dust everywhere, broken A/C with a weird sound and wardrobe completely destroyed. Besides, everything smelled of cannabis, I asked for a room change and they moved me from bad to worst. I asked for a refund and they needed approval from the manager, ran out from there and book another room in a nice hotel in the area. Not coming back to that place ever again",2,1
"When The Paul Hotel opened, I was lucky to reserve a room at such a great rate.  It had great service and amenities.  The restaurant was open to serve breakfast - a buffet or a la carte.  My room was changed (as well as the linen) everday.  My recent visit was 9/4 and 9/5 was different.  My linen was not changed, the coffee maker was not working properly, and even though I set the temperature at 75 degrees, the temperature was 65 degrees when we woke up.  We did not get bottled water for the coffee/tea maker.  There was a strong smell of MJ in the lobby.  This used to be my favorite place to stay when in NYC.  Not anymore!",1,1
"We stayed here expecting something simple, but nice. While the staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel is kept up well enough, the cleanliness of the room left something to be desired.  There was a coating of dust on lamps, the shelf on the bathroom and the windowsill. The grout in the shower was a bit gross, and I kind of wished I had brought a pair of flip flops to shower in. I expect that in a hostel, but not a hotel of the star rating we were sold. We also took issue with the fact that the comforter/duvet cover was just two bedsheets loosely folded around it, so that they shifted and exposed the blanket as we slept. The heater/AC unit was also terribly unclean. We tried to use the heater to dry some of our clothes after getting soaked by rain, but the air coming out",2,1
"I called ahead of time to add a name to the room as I was just traveling and arriving late. The Front Desk staff told me all I had to do was send my Gov. ID and the name to be added. Very strange policy, but I did it anyway. Later, the person I added was not able to check-in despite following these directions. I called the hotel, and the night auditor was beyond incompetent and said this wasn't enough. My guest waited over an hour for me to arrive and it was already late. When I came to check-in, he gave nothing but excuses and also had my ID printed out on a full sheet of paper in plain view on the desk. He even held it up in front of strangers who were also in the lobby. This is unacceptable. Not only that, I booked directly through the website and paid for a King which was",1,1
"Worst hotel experience I've ever had in NYC.  Good luck trying to get an actual person on the phone when you call the hotel directly.  Arrived 2 hours early and charged $54 early check-in fee.  Food was inedible.  There was so much moisture in the room, caused laptop damage.",1,1
This is the worse hotel experience I have ever had in my life. I made a reservation the Paul Hotel. THe room smelled like mold and mildew which I am allergic to. I had an allergic reaction right in front of the manager DIDI. I could not stay there because of health reasons. They refused to refund my money. I booked this Hotel through Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo tried to call and email the manager. She would not respond. I called Choice hotel's customer service because the Paul Hotel is one of their hotels. They refused to refund my money. Anyone can go to Paul Hotel's Website and read the terrible reviews and experiences.,1,1
It was the worst stay in a NYC hotel I have ever had. No air-conditioning....the lights went off and on all night long and no one seemed to care. I found out from the front desk person when I left at 4am that they have electrical problems on the lower floor. So becareful!,1,1
"Used my points to stay here. Was placed on 2nd floor, and was told unable to have a complimentary room upgrade even with better rooms being available. The decks attached to the room had no view, and no privacy with the other rooms next door. ANYONE could go into your hotel room without the key to the room from the outside deck. Not worth your money or points. I expect better as a Diamond Elite Status member.",1,1
Extremely disappointed in the the Paul !! Had to change rooms 3time shower was broke A/C didn’t work finally got a room where everything worked doubt I’ll ever stay here again conveniently local close to everything but hotel just didn’t meet the standard as previous stays,1,1
"Many different problems.  Decent room, but. Flooding in the bathroom.  Bad design. No bedside light the first night because Both unscrewed and Staff diagnosed blown fuse. No answer for repeated phone calls regarding above at desk, necessitating re-dressing and going down 13 floors. No coffee for Keurig machine until buttonholing maid in the hall. Air conditioner indifferent/faulty.",2,1
"Paid almost $500 for a weekend stay at this hotel. Not only did we have to change rooms TWICE due to broken AC units (once immediately upon arrival and the second after returning back from a night out at 3am, rooms were over 80F), but both people at the front desk were cold and unopen to helping until pushed to. I will say both me that came to attempt to fix our AC units were kind especially under the circumstances. Both rooms (King ""city view"" aka direct view into the office building next door) were not up to any sort of hotel standard, w a cracked mirror and broken lights. The website photos of this place are wildly misleading, I would highly recommend just spending the extra $ to stay in a place you can actually depend on.",1,1
"I ended up in this hotel against my will. The hotel’s management also apparently owns Econolodge Times Square, and it was that hotel that I booked. Little did I know that the Econolodge no longer exists. The management closed it, but never bothered to take the listing down from Booking.com or warn the traveler. Imagine a solo lady traveler who arrives to her hotel in the middle of the night only to discover that the door is locked (looks like it has been locked for months), and a crooked note on the door says “You are being relocated at our sister property, the Paul Hotel”. To say I was stunned is to say nothing. This is not the kind of note you want ro see after a 7-hour trip at 11:00 pm in the middle of Manhattan’s dubious area, where you’ve just witnessed a fight broke.",1,1
"Incredibly rude front desk when we checked in at night. Wrote our room number on a post it note. There is NO SECURITY. A guy followed us  into the hotel and went on the elevator . The front desk person just gave me the reply that “there have only been a couple of incidents” and there was a bellhop but no security. Room smelled of urine. We would have checked out except it was late , raining and we were tired. Area is great and front desk was more professional in the morning.",2,1
"It's small but that's to be expected for NY hotels. More concerning was the complete lack of cleanliness, particularly of the bedding. There's no fitted sheet so the flat sheet draped over the mattress kept falling off to reveal a dirty mattress including an actual cigarette burn. There's no duvet cover but just a comforter between two flat sheet. Again the flat sheets would fall off to reveal and absolutely disgusting comforter. There was one spot where a portion of the comforter had been cut out to remove a stain but they didn't get all of it and you could see the remnants of the stain around the edge of the cut.",1,1
"We recently booked a room with a deck only to find out that all the deck rooms at the hotel were 'out of order' when we checked in. These rooms have apparently been 'out of order' for a while due to construction next door and shouldn't even have been an option for us to select when we booked our stay. That's a problem because the only reason we decided to stay here was because of the deck.  We were given the standard 'super tiny room without a deck' and helpfully assured that we wouldn't be charged the 'deck room' rate, which is a little like renting a car, being given a bicycle, and then being told 'Don't worry -- you're only being charged for the bike.' Gee, thanks so much.   Talked to the front desk to see what we could do about making a reasonable adjustment to our bill,",2,1
"The fire alarm situation was the worst experience ever at a hotel. My wife and I were locked in our room during the fire alarm and had to dial 911 to get out. Luckily a guest heard us and opened the door after 20mns of banging and screaming. This has me and my wife stressed and very worried about staying at hotels. The clerk said being locked is a security procedure   The rooms are so small it’s ridiculous. 2 adults cannot maneuver in the room together. The room is over priced , we had mold on the bathroom ceiling that the houseman said he knew was there and the wanted to charge us $750 for dialing 911 and we were locked in during a fire alarm   Nightmare from hell",1,1
"They forgot to clean my room in 3 days, they don’t have enough staff. Total unacceptable. They said me yesterday that will go the day after and they never came. The person of the front desk never try to help, he only say sorry please go to your room. And that I have to put all the trash in front my door. Please don’t go to this hotel.",1,1

"This Hotel has fallen apart at the hands of Management.  I do not blame housekeeping or any other employees other than management. I was about to step in the shower but right before I did something on the floor very sharp punctured my foot.  I then went to get napkins and noticed a USED SYRINGE in the ice bucket. I am now very worried about what punctured me.  I then looked around and noticed the bedding had not been cleaned and there was definitely some sex stains, pizza box with pizza In it in one of the draws, and a lot of other things Management doesn't think is important in a ""Luxury Brand Hotel"" during a pandemic in which the #1 thing to not catch the virus and die is SANITARY CONDITIONS along with responsible businesses caring/protecting its customers/guests.

"I would not recommend this hotel for stay in the NYC area. The front desk lady was rude to us when we had concerns such that our lock on the door did not work, our phone did not work to call down to the front desk, the light in our bathroom would randomly turn on unless the door was shut, the door to the bathroom was also a pain to close super hard to slide it open/shut, the A/C did not work whatsoever it was near 80 degrees in the room the whole time even when we tried to lower it it never got cooler. Oh and it says they have a gym-I assure you they don’t, we asked and the front desk told us it’s down the street. Will not be staying again, do not recommend whatsoever.",1,1
"When we first arrive in the lobby , the hostess waived with her hand so we can wait without saying nothing. She didn’t tell us about any rules or amnesty of the hotel  The room was tiny and dirty , dust everywhere. We ask for changing room they lie and say they are no other room available or I was able to book a room on their website. Guys don’t go in this hotel , is the worst service .",1,1
"I asked for a Family Room at another Hotel and was redirected here on the day of my trip. From the beginning of my stay, It was what I expected because my family and I intended to be together. We had TV issues (coming on and off), Never had our room clean, Had to call or ask more then 3 times for new towels and bad sheets. Our food order was stolen from someone on the property. People in the lobby came in and out without having mask on. Security was at an all time low.",1,1
The Paul claims to be a boutique hip hotel.  This hotel leaves a lot to be desired. The floors reeked of cannabis smoke. I watched a drug deal going down outside.  Vagrants hanging out in the entry way to the hotel. Only received housekeeping once during a 3 night stay despite calling to request it on both mornings and leaving my door tagged to request it. The room was tiny even by NYC standards. I ended up here because the TRYP transferred my reservation here.  I'm incredibly disappointed with both hotels.  I won't stay at either of them for future stays.,2,1
"The rooms were stupidly humid because there is no door between the bedroom and the bathroom, just a sliding door that leaves a large gap for air to flow through. The sheets are worse than a motel 6. They don’t believe in fitted sheets or house keeping checking fridges for rotten food either. The shower floods the bathroom floor because there is a huge gap by ones feet, where the shower naturally aims that leaves water all over the exterior of the shower itself. I’d use the AC instead of the mini fridge to keep things cool. No microwave, most services are limited. 99% of what’s on TV you have to pay for.",2,1
"Nos hicieron pagar por adelantado el primer día (6/03/2020) y tuvimos que irnos antes por el estado de alarma del coronavirus y el cierre de fronteras.

They made us pay in advance when we checked in, Marc 3rd, 2020, and we had to leave earlier due to coronavirus alarm state, they stole the price of the nights we didn´t use, after telling us they would give us a refund, they never did. Absolute thieves.",1,1
"I booked a reservation for a 5 night stay with a 3rd party the night before I was supposed to check in due to my planned sleeping arrangements being disrupted because of the Corona virus. When I get to the hotel I tell them I may need to shorten my stay and they say that it's not a problem, but that their policy is that I will be charged an extra night than what I'm actually staying as some sort of cancellation fee. I am totally fine with this, but they look into my reservation further and see it's through a third party and say that I'll have to call them to change my check out date. Ok cool, so I do that and my booking company says their policy is to follow the hotel's policy and that they just need to call the hotel to get permission. That's fine I guess. So they call the",1,1
"The hotel itself is fine - rooms are small, be prepared for that. The service on the other hand? Absolutely brutal. We arrived in NYC on March 12th, and upon arrival, the city was declared a state of emergency. We are Canadian, and the rumours started that our country might close the borders due to Covid-19. We asked to speak with the manager no less than 4 times and she was nowhere to be found. What kind of manager leaves someone in charge at a time like that who cannot make major decisions or help guests in a time like this? Piss poor leadership, to say the least.  We left NYC the very next day to come back to Canada - everything in NYC was basically shut down at this point. We did NOT ask for a refund, we asked for them to move our remaining 2 nights to another date, and to",1,1
"When we arrived (before check in) they told us that our room just wasn’t ready yet. We had no problem with this and went and explored the area. When we returned (after checkin time) we were told that they were going to have to put us into a queen room instead of the king room I had booked because they “just didn’t have one available” the woman behind the counter tried to mumble through some excuse of maintenance which she didn’t even sound to believe. They offered NO means of accommodating the downgrade until we made it clear that we paid more for the king room (bigger bed and bigger room, all the rooms in this hotel look virtually the same otherwise) and were unhappy with this service. They agreed that they would put us into a king room for our next night we had booked and gave",2,1
"Completely unprofessional service, service with a scowl, impatient front desk. The staff they have working in customer-facing positions at the Paul Hotel have no business dealing with the public.  I was treated as a nuisance rather than a guest from the moment I checked in. After mostly neutral aloofness, the desk attendant working the morning shift was outright hostile.   I purchased the breakfast buffet for myself and two young children. I was double charged for the breakfast, and when I pressed the issue, the desk attendant was dismissive and told me to “be patient”. I was simply trying to avoid being ripped off. After breakfast, I desk-checked our small overnight bag, but you’d think this request was a major imposition. Upon returning to retrieve our bag, the desk attendant,",1,1
"We had a terrible time. If I could leave 0 stars, I would. My party of 4 spent two nights at this hotel. We check in and see our room, which is the size of a closet. When booking the hotel, we were told of a rooftop bar and valet parking, neither or which were available. Our room had minimal space, with extremely loud construction happening outside of our room. The ice machine didn't work, the hot water was hit or miss, and the hotel bar was terrible. When we complained to the desk that we paid $400 for one night for such terrible accommodations, the response was ""that's one of our bigger rooms."" After the first night we requested a refund and to speak to the manager. There was NO manager on site during our stay. What hotel doesn't have a manager on site on a weekend, let alone",1,1
"Very noisy rooms; You have to chose if you want to sleep with cold or noise!  Air cond. machine makes a lot of noise... From 10pm no one answers you the phone, neither the lobby, nor the concierge, nor the room service. If you need something you have to drees your self and walk to the reception. I didint take breakfast at the hotel but I visited the room, it is in the basement and realy poor.",2,1
"So in a deep sleep the water hose from the ice maker exploded and filled my room with water. Tried to call front desk, housekeeping, concierge, guest services - not a soul would answer. Had to leave a message - yet all mailboxes were full. I scramble to get dressed before the entire room is flooded (thinking with a fire it would be full of smoke given how quickly it came in) with some of my wet things. I go to the front desk to leave and the guy says “You’re all set and paid!”  No offer to take care of my clothing, a discount on the room or even a free cup of coffee. I ask for some sort of disposition and the response was “I would have take it up with corporate.” Awful experience. Terrible service. Very weird vibe.",1,1
"I do not recommend this hotel ... they said that have watched a movie that I didn’t watch. Even proving with photos that I was in a dinner at the time they said that I watched the movie, they said they could do nothing because the hotel would be charged by a partner company. They charged $ 19 for a service I didn't use and the guest simply has nothing to do. Think carefully before staying at this hotel. This system will make more victims, and may be charged over $ 100. I do not recommend this hotel mainly for this mistake and for the lack of commitment on the part of all hotel staff. Even realizing that I was absolutely right, they simply said they could do nothing.",1,1
"I only give the Paul two stars because of the location ... otherwise it's one. Everything else about my stay was terrible. First the room was poorly lit, lacked a nightstand, and had no full length mirror. The bed was very uncomfortable. The elevators are VERY slow. The bathroom had no light over the mirror and no counter space. The service was also bad. Housekeeping did not clean our room one day and did not replenish coffee supplies on three days (we were there for 5 days), But the worst is when you complain to hotel staff and that make you repeat the same complaints over and over but NEVER do anything about it. Even at the end of my stay, I took the time to fill out a form about my stay ... all I got back was an email (from a non-responding address) saying ""I'm sorry"" from a",2,1

"We arrived at this hotel with high expectations after reading reviews and viewing online photos. What we had read described what seemed to be a different hotel.  We were greeted by an indifferent staff member who didn’t seem to care very much beyond wanting us to let her get back to her day.  The room was of decent size but lacked basic amenities that one would expect from a hotel of this price point. (Plastic cups are great for a roadside motel people)  No place to hang anything In the washroom, and no counter at all completed the lack of attention.   If you feel the desire to pay for an upscale hotel but receive all the services and amenities you’d expect at the NO TELL motel then you should stay at the PAUL NYC.",2,1
"Staff attitude was something to behold. Just plain rude. Whilst NY isn’t ever going to be quiet, the Paul is located opposite an enormous construction site, and boy is it noisy at all hours of the day.

Avoid this place if you find anything else around or below $200, it will almost certainly be a better deal.",1,1
"The room I got was extremely small. It's probably the worst I have never seen in my life in a hotel. The overall feeling about quality (furniture, services available in the room, noise) lets me think of a low-cost hotel. Not only the room was very small, but the bed was too small for me! And it was not possible to upgrade (the hotel was fully booked) or cancel my reservation after seeing the room. Calling the reception from the room puts you in relation with an office which is not the reception, and they weren't even able to explain the cancellation terms to me (whereas the agents at the reception were able to do it). Despite all of this, the price I had to pay was extremely high compared with what I got! The only positive point was the location, which is very good.",1,1

I stayed at the Paul Hotel from September 5th, 2019 to September 6th, 2019. They overbooked and 3 of my coworkers who were charged for their stay had to then argue to get reimbursed and moved to another hotel even though it was the booking staff’s fault. I didn’t heed the warning of one irate lady who said that she wants her money back for the remaining 3 nights of her 4 night stay because her and her husband could not sleep all night from the jack hammers outside.

We arrived in the morning and I met one of the managers who told me she was working on our rooms at that very moment, but we could not check in until 3 PM.

There wasn't breakfast available, the rooftop bar was out of almost everything we tried to order, the kitchen was closed at the rooftop bar even though they said they were open. The bar next to the lobby that was supposed to be open until 2:00am never even opened at all. We had to wait until 5:30pm to checkin because it took so long for our room to be cleaned from the previous guest. While waiting over 8 hours to checkin we weren't even allowed to use the restroom in the lobby because they require a room key to access.

Many guests were complaining of issues and mistakes made with payments. Some of these people were left with no money after being overcharged by the hotel. The photos of the rooms are misleading.

"We reserved two rooms at the Paul for my Canadian mother in laws 60th birthday party. When we arrived at 9:45pm only one room was ready, and we had to wait 20 minutes for the other room to be ready. My mother in laws room, which she shared with her sister was just fine, but the room four of us shared...oye.   I kept reading reviews before our trip that the AC in some rooms were having issues. Knowing what NYC summers are like, I was getting a bit nervous upon reading this numerous times in recent reviews. And sure enough, our room had horrible AC. They offered to come and fix it for us the next day after laying in pools of sweat at night.   We explained to them that our mom's room was set at 67 and ours was at 67 and it was a 180 difference in temp. The fix did nothing. I'm not",1,1

Construction work didn’t help the sleepless nights either. When we arrived to our room, we had a  complimentary small bottle of water although the hotel knew to expect 2 guests. The whole time we stayed, our floor did not get cleaned or swept once. We intentionally left a bit of card on the floor and it did not even get picked up. The windows were also filthy. Will not be staying here again.",2,1
"Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and it was not a good experience. The only pro is the location, but other than that it is not worth it and this is definitely not a 4 star hotel. What others said about the construction going on is very true - understandable and this is not the hotel’s fault, BUT the noise from the AC is unbearable. There was another loud noise that I recorded and showed it to the manager ( it happened multiple times a day) when she heard it, she said it was from the AC or the vacuum, then I figured out is came from the mini fridge. The windows are filthy, which ruins the great view of the ES (another pro) Our second day we left at 10 am and returned at 11:00 pm, I only wanted to shower and go to sleep. No towels!! Called the front office and requested towels,",1,1
"We got a good deal for our stay because of the construction nearby.  That was fine, we had earplugs, but the rest of the stay was pretty bad.  When we first checked in, we got our keys only to unlock the door to a room that already had another guest's belongings in it. We went back down and got a new room, but it didn't make me feel safe in leaving our belongings in the room, or even us being safe when we were in the room at night, if anyone could be mistakenly given another set of our keys.  Our ""free breakfast"" deal turned out to be one per person for only one day, different days, despite the fact we stayed two nights.  The breakfast options were pretty pathetic for a normally $14 meal. There was also no space in the basement to even eat.  Our room's AC was either super cold",1,1

They had no manager on duty (what hotel has NO manager on duty at night) and gave us a room with bunk beds.

The room had very poor lighting making it hard to work and use the sink area. The room fridge was jammed under the desk so you had to sit at an angle to use it. I can't believe how you would get two people in a room like that with luggage.   I told the staff the sink light appeared to be broken because it was only coming on low.  They said they would have it looked at by engineering.  When I came back that night, it",2,1
"After a friendly service at book in, was so disappointed how small the room was. There was no where to put 2 suitcases & 2 carry ons anywhere. Although a great location with a view of the Empire State Building from our window, I’m afraid that’s where it ends. There was No hot water from the shower, after leaving the shower run for over 6 minutes 38 seconds, Yes I did time it, we ended up with no running water from the shower. After 4 days of complaining about the water we gave up. No compensation was suggested when we complained every day, they could have suggested to move our room or drink voucher or something but nothing.  My niece asked reception for recommendations on where we could eat, they suggested their restaurant. Which we decided to try as there was 12 of us, all",2,1
This was a nightmare from the beginning. We arrived on the 28th November to be told that we were too early and to come back in 3 hours. Then when we returned we were told that there were no rooms available due to heavy rain previously. We were moved to another hotel and told to come back the next day. We had a full day planed the next day so had to change our plans to accommodate going to checkout of the alternative hotel and re check into the Paul. We were not compensated for this inconvenience and we had a half hearted apology from Mohan behind the desk. We were eventually given our room. The only reason I have give 2 stars and not 1 is that the room was nice. The bed was very comfy and the bathroom was very clean and well stocked. Then the drama continued. When we checked out,2,1
"5 of us recently visited NYC, with three staying in the Paul and two in another. The family in the paul said the rooms were great but that is where it stopped. The receptionist did not know what she was doing and was working on her own during very busy periods. Apart from the 5 of us, we had other family members come into NYC from PA and NJ, the family from PA were staying in the hotel and before they left PA they called to confirm their booking and were told there was no record of the booking but when my cousin was able to confirm the booking from paperwork the booking was then found. The bar was a joke. We got three rounds of the same drinks and each time the total was higher then the last. We had planned to have a family get together on the saturday night but due to the price",1,1
"Visiting from NZ for work I had booked an online deal to stay at The Paul via Booking.com.  A few weeks in advance I received an email from the hotel looking forward to receiving me for my stay.  From that point on the whole experience was sadly a negative one.   On check-in day, after a long day it meetings across Manhattan, i arrived at the hotel just before 7pm only to be told that there was some ‘bad news’ - my room had flood damage and I would have to go to a sister hotel (The TRYP) 15 mins away.  Slightly odd as it had not rained in the two days I’d been in the city, but they said it had occurred the last time it was raining. They would pay my taxi fare to get me to the TRYP, and that was that. Initial inconvenience was two fold, I had picked that hotel to be near venues",2,1
Hotel is fine. But only if you’re okay with being woken up by jackhammering at 7am from the construction site next door. Incredibly noisy... even from our room on the 16th floor. There’s construction on both sides of the hotel with one construction site just getting started.,1,1
"We booked this trip a couple of months back and yes we did see the mixed reviews but given the perfect location we went ahead.  Ugh what a mistake!  We had nonstop problems with our room Since check in... the tv never worked, the room was filthy, then someone was running a sawzall right behind our shower and managed to set off the fire alarm On our room.  When the “maintenance” person arrived they blamed that on us taking too hot of a shower.  What?  Then when we tried multiple times to explain what was happening at the time the alarm was set off both the “Maintenance” person and THE HOTEL MANAGER poo pooed the whole thing off!  We stopped every day of our stay to see if our room could be cleaned and our television looked at and it Was never addressed by the staff.  Finally we",1,1
"First let me write something positive:  the location is perfect for meetings nearby,  there is good subway access, and it is an easy quick walk from Penn Station.   But...This hotel must be competing for the ""Smallest hotel room in NYC award"" Everything about the room was small and crowded.  And given that it's not cheap, it probably wins the ""Most expensive hotel per square inch of room space in NYC award""  (not including the luxury places that go for $10k per night).  Much to my surprise, I was given a room with a two-level bunkbed, fully equipped with a hobbit-sized ladder. I've never seen bunkbeds in major city hotel before, ever.  Not only were they bunkbeds, but they were barely long enough for me (and I am under 6' tall).  The only vessels from which to drink water were",2,1
Somehow a reservation in my name showed up at this hotel accident on hotels.com..... and called immediately to cancel. Literally within the first 24 hours. Hotels.com tried calling the hotel for DAYS..... hours spent on the phone and no one ever picked up . I finally called myself and left a message for a manager. No one called back.  Two weeks later I tried again.... calling hotels who had to call the Paul to cancel.... I called as well. No one ever got back to them or me.  Two MONTHS LATER - I finally got a hotel employee on the line who said the manager was busy and would call me back. No manager ever did .. i left at least 5 messages.  This was a fradulent charge for hundreds of dollars that I never made and the hotel went through with it and would not get rid of it.  I  let,1,1
"Don’t book this hotel if you are a light sleeper, construction starts at 7am. Would have been great if the hotel advised of this. On top of that, the room was disgusting, dirty pillows and sheets. Ground had crumbs and was never swept during stay. Generally unclean.",1,1
1. Why should I listen to marketing down my through before I can speak to anyone on any internal line. For folk sakes America please try and make it nice again.  2.

I trust the double charges not my card will be reversed...,1,1
"Just about each of the amenities are not correct. No room service, you can't even call the  restaurant.  Then the menu in the rooms are not correct.  The hours of service was off, we missed breakfast and once we had to go down to order, they didn't have any of the desserts or the kids menu.  The bar tender said he could still order the sliders that was on the kids menu.  When I got them, they had blue cheese on them instead of BBQ sauce.  No kid likes blue cheese.  And then he said cheerfully that it was only $13 which was not the kid price stated on the room menus. The coffee was not replenished each day, I had to call several times each day to get it and the 'complementary water' is a water cooler on the first floor with simple cups. TV screen didn't work until the 3rd time",2,1
"I arrived to what looked like a nice, trendy hotel.  When I got to my room, I noticed the A/C wasn't working.  I had to leave for dinner and called downstairs when I got back.  I called again 30 minutes later, and after 1 hour, maintenance came to my room at 10pm. Once the A/C was fixed, the room was freezing. I was up every 30 min all night adjusting the temperature up and down because the room was either too hot or too cold. Additionally, upon check in, I provided my ID, and didn't notice it wasn't returned to me until a day later when I was at the airport.  So for 24 hours, the hotel had my ID at the front desk and did nothing about it. The hotel wouldn't send a car to the airport, even though I offered to pay.  I then asked the hotel to expedite shipping my ID back to my",2,1
"Let's start with the positives. The price we paid through online booking was very reasonable for NYC. The location is good and convenient. The rooms are extremely small but if you plan to be out all day, it doesn't matter. The bed was comfortable. BUT. As we arrived before the 4 PM check-in, we left our luggage and returned after the business dinner at 11 PM. My room was on the 17th floor. Up I went with the luggage, the key did not work. Down I went again and got new keys. This time the key worked ... the door opened ... partially ... the latch on the inside was on because they had given me the key to AN OTHERWISE OCCUPIED ROOM. I was not happy by that point so told them to please be certain about whatever room they sent me to next. A housekeeping person supposedly went in",2,1
This was the worst experience I have had in NYC!   Upon arrival you would think that I would be greeted by the receptionist desk.  No!!  I felt like I was putting them out.   My reservation included 2 complimentary drink...….I felt like I had to beg for it.  The staff was so clueless.   After a night in a very warm room we went down to get some breakfast only to find that it looked like scavenger's beat us to it.   When we asked at the front desk where we could get a sit down breakfast.  The girl as the desk gave us the wrong street!!  I would not stay here again if they gave me a free room!,1,1
"A total disregard for its customers and the service was horrific. Upon arrival we where told that a ""maintenance issue"" has caused them to have no double, king or queen rooms available!   I had booked the best room to help us enjoy my wife's very special trip to New York ... which was ruined by The Paul Hotel.   We where offered a bunk room (yes, bunk beds) or we could go and find somewhere else to stay.   Amazingly at the exact same time a party of 30 maybe had arrived ... coincidence, I think not.  After a day of travelling we really had no option ... we where given a voucher for a ""complementary breakfast"" ... oh dear god ... take a look at the pictures!   Room was tiny, wifi wouldn't work, opposite a construction yard. Unhelpful and somewhat rude staff.   The hotel is a lot",1,1
"We checked in after a very long journey today to be told there was plumbing problems and our Queen room with a view would not be available and we had to stay in a bunk room. Well that was like a prison cell..... awful service at Reception when I got upset, she said I could go and find somewhere else to stay. All she offered me was a breakfast voucher for tomorrow morning. There was a group of about 20 people coming inso we think it was a last minute booking and they gave our room away!! Never ever stay here. My 40th birthday tomorrow and my husband organised this as a surprise, to say I’m upset is an understatement 😢😢😢",1,1
"I stayed there for 2 days. The rooms were like the size of cell in a prison movie. Construction sight outside was horrificly loud. The bar, let me not get started. Horrible over charging. Cannabis smokers outside.  The only good part was when I was greeted by a young woman at the reception named April. She made us laugh from check in to check out. Thanks to her.....or else my stay would have been a complete disaster. She was the only reason worth a star. If it were to rate people.. .I would have given her 5 stars. She needs a raise. Especially working there.",1,1
"Appreciate that this hotel is probably not high end New York but over 300 dollars per night is high end as far as I am concerned and there was no luxury here. The room was quite tight, had no full length wardrobe hanging space and very little cupboard space. The towels were thin and not a decent bath sheet size. Breakfast was a disaster...understaffed (they worked very hard to try and accommodate everyone but they can only do so much). The choice is hardly vast and you are allocated one medium plate when you hand over your breakfast voucher....so just balance everything on that.....no spare plates to be had ....and we ran out of bowls most mornings for cereal too. We ran out of milk, hot water, bread, fruit and the 2 hot dishes on offer most mornings but weekends are especially",2,1
"Don't stay here unless you want to be a kid again, who stays in a bunk bed unless you're five years old. On top of that the toilet was dirty we asked to change rooms only thing we got offered was a room change almost a hour later. Plus no heat in the room and we could not call the front desk because the phone did not even work.",1,1
"I really hate giving bad reviews to hotels because I understand that after all its a business and there are real people with jobs at risk. I will try and be gentle and describe my experience as positively as possible.  Arriving at the hotel there was only one receptionist who was on the phone and actually had me waiting for almost 10 minutes before reaching out. Eventually I got the wrong room, and had to change.   I had a queen size room that I found very small. There was a nice view of the Empire State Building. Mini Bar was empty and I found the in-room air conditioner to be very loud. But with time I got used to the noise. Shower quality is average. Housekeeping does a pretty good job cleaning the room.   No dry cleaning service is offered. I was actually told that I have to",2,1
"...what we got was a tiny box!  My colleague and I decided to share a room to cut company costs and to take advantage of the prime location and the suite we were promised.  The photos on the website made the room look spacious.  I should've known that it was tomfoolery!  The beds were basically on top of each other.  The bathroom was basically on top of one of the beds.  The terrace overlooked the wig shop, etc and we could leap right into our neighbors terrace as well.  One of the staff knocked on our door to come through our room so he could clean the outside windows.  Seems odd that they didn't do that prior to our arrival!  The AC unit was loud and clicking all night so I didn't get much rest.  I will say, the bathroom in the restaurant downstairs was beautiful and breakfast",2,1
"1. The hotel has a really weird policy of included breakfast. We have booked a room including a breakfast, but upon arrival we were informed that extra $2 per day per person is applicable. One time they called it a 'tax', another it was a 'service charge', but in any case paid in cash without any receipt directly to the canteen's staff. Tips are OK, but considering the service at the canteen was non-existent (no clean plates/forks/knives, poor food selection), on the second day we refused to pay the fee, as tips presume likeable service. Upon this the canteen's staff wagered a full-blown offensive on us, refusing to give us clean plates ans so on, unless we pay in cash directly to them, once again confirming that the fee was rather tips, than tax. We escalated the issue to the",1,1
"Not a bad hotel, however the pictures are very deceiving. There was no tub for the shower, just a regular bathroom floor with drains making a complete mess of water and a safety hazard. Garbage left out in the hall, cracked mirrors, the locks for the bathroom and terrace were not working. I was under the impression that the terrace would be completely private however, it is in fact separated by a mini “garden” and is  shared. At least the people were nice",2,1
"jack hammering from early am, loud hammering comes right thru the windows, do not stay here if u need to spend anytime in hotel during day, or like to sleep in, usually in past a hotel would offer something to customers for such loud noisy construction site directly across the tiny street noise noise noise, it might be gone in ten months mean time stay away",1,1
Was placed in a room without normal shower - had handicap access.  Water from shower wetted down all the towels and I and my husband slipped in bathroom several times while trying to dress in the mornings.  Extra towels were never left although it was obvious when all of ours were spread out all over floor in bathroom to clean up extra water.,2,1
"I was assigned a VERY small room, with twin bunk beds. Although the decor is quite modern and nice, the room reminded me of a college dorm. There was barely enough room for me to get dressed.   Also, when I lifted the cheap mattress, there were used earplugs and lots of crumbs between the mattress and the bed frame.  Good for a cheap stay - and for any college students, but professional travelers should look elsewhere.",2,1
"Let me start by saying I book a lot of hotels and I am also an ex GM of a hotel so I understand a lot about the customer and customer service. I booked this hotel a couple weeks in advance on Expedia.com.  I've had generally very good experiences with Expedia and sites like Expedia so I feel confident booking there.  My negative review I feel is more the fault of the Paul Hotel due to the way they choose to advertise their rooms on Expedia.  They have many options for booking such as queen mod, manhattan king, manhattan double, terrace double, two twin beds, bunk bed mod.  I was staying with a friend of mine so we needed two beds.  We did not want the bunk bed option so we booked the twin bed option as the others were sold out.  The Twin Bed option states there will be a room",2,1
"Stayed there a night in June on vacation. Hotel room on second floor came with a rooftop patio. The door, however, would not lock and didn't have a deadbolt or anything; likely to keep people from getting locked outside. Kind of an issue when the people in the room next to you seem like they're high.  It's nice that the front desk will hold your bags for you for something like $5 a bag before/after check out so you can tour the city.  Walls were paper thin- could hear the couple next door loudly until 3:00 AM, and they weren't doing anything loud. Just the TV on low and the occasional softly spoken word.  Breakfast in the morning includes a 'new' service fee of something like $2 a person, even when breakfast is ""included"" and you have a voucher. Except there's no service to",2,1
"Never book anything non refundable . Big mistake. Booked because room was ""perfect"" for 2 adults and 2 kids, because there was a rooftop terrace, a restaurant on site and breakfast. Also central. The room is so tiny we can not turn around without bumping into something. No place for suitcases. A/C is Right up against bed and bed Shakes and the noise is going Right in the matteess. Just a sliding door to bathroom - no privacy. The rooftop terrace is a non kid friendly bar, and is rented out to closed events. The ""restaurAnt"" is not run by hotel they said, when I asked if we could expect more of what was on the menu, to be available(unfortunately tired kids dont really allow dinong around town every Night, why it was important). It feels like you enter a grotto.dark",1,1
"I had high hopes for this hotel. We stayed here for three nights. We had a nice view from a high floor. It's in a great location. We had a package that included breakfast vouchers, but there was still a small fee for the adults to eat. The food was adequate. The room was smaller than expected for a double room, but I can accept that being it's NYC. However, we had to call the front desk every night for maintenance because our air con stopped working. They had to fix it three times. Keep in mind that the temps were in the high 90s our entire stay. Even with this happening I was still going to give the hotel four stars.  However, we came downstairs one morning to find the young lady behind the front desk cursing and loudly talking about her private life. She was talking about how",2,1
"First of all I have to say that we never got the room we booked for, so let's start there.  We arrived, the first thing was charging us with a deposit without saying that the room had something already damaged, the bathroom mirror broken, etc. We never got the info that this room was connected to another one, which was noisy since the first moment. The room was also in a really low floor. We complained about it and they told us that all premium rooms were connected (bit strange) and they said that next day we could be moved to a better room, not connected. We talked and decided to change room around 3pm and when we got to the hotel they already moved all our stuff to a smaller room. First, they did not have our permission to move our stuff as we did not close our suitcases,",1,1
I have never been to a worse hotel in my life. I have been in close to 80 different countries. We checked in early in the morning as our flight was delayed. The told us that after 4pm all reservations are canceled and I would not get my money back. It was pouring rain outside we had no where to go all other hotels were booked. I called the police for left because I thought there was no other option. After the police arrived the front desk person finally decided to give us a room. I decided to take a shower the hot water didn't work. They sent an engineer to fix the water. It still didn't work I opted to take a freezing cold shower so at least I was clean. At about 5am the jackhammering started and whole hotel room started to shake. The hotel is next to a giant construction site.,1,1
"AVOID.  Nasty people into ""bait-and-switch""  Booked the room through Priceline Express.  Then looking at the actual hotel site, I saw that their ""sleeps 2"" rooms are BUNKS.  They refused to cancel my reservation. Talked to Priceline and (after discussing this with the second level CSR at Priceline) they agreed that a $175, 3.5* room ought not be a set of bunk beds.  Priceline forced the hotel to cancel and refund the money.  (I was in NYC and walked over to the hotel. The two desk agents were the nastiest people I have ever experienced at a decent hotel. ) Avoid all of this hassle.  Do not book at this hotel.  You will see that they will not offer comments on these reviews because there is no defense.  See the other reviewers with this experience!",1,1
"Stayed there for a day. The best part was the interaction with the front desk people. I went to check in and the lady at the front desk said she will look up my reservation. I said 'thank you ma'am' and she got so upset on being called ma'am. She said only old ladies are called ma'am and I should not have called her that.  Then I was informed that my reservation had 2 bunk beds like a hostel as I had somehow clicked on 'hotel chooses my bed' option. I went online and showed them both the rooms (room with the queen bed and hotel chooses bed) and that there was no difference in the price. But she said if I wanted to stay in the hotel, I'd have to go for the bunk bed option. Then I asked for a cancellation which she refused and told me I'll have to pay extra for the room with the",2,1

So, ok, day before check in I called and spoke with a pleasant woman named Claudia who informed me that in order to get a noise free room we have to pay $40 MORE than we already paid. If I hadn't booked through a third party site and prepaid I would cancel immediately!!!! Seems very shady to ask for more money. Basically be prepared to pay extra if you want peace and quiet.

I could deal with the space issues but the fact that we had no hot water all weekend (and I'm an early riser and in the shower by 6:30am) and the water pressure was ridiculously low, was extremely unacceptable. The roof top bar is basically a patio and if there are more than 10 people out there, it's shoulder to shoulder! When we checked out, we had planned on doing some shopping before leaving the city. When stopping to leave our bags, we were informed that it would be $5 per bag over 2 bags! Because of the lack of hot water, they waived the bag fee. The staff was mostly friendly but I",2,1
"IF YOU BOOKED THROUGH HOTWIRE, you should contact them and ask for another hotel. The one star rating is not for the quality of the hotel but for the dishonesty of their operation.  The M.O. of the hotel is to assign couples to a room with a bunk bed and then charge an additional $40 per night to change to a room with a queen. The desk clerk admitted to me that do this as a matter of policy. I've booked through Hotwire at least a dozen times and have never been scammed in such a fashion.   My sense is that if they do something like this routinely, they are more than likely dishonest in other ways as well. Probably best to avoid the place.",1,1
"I booked a room supposedly for 3 people because I was traveling with friends. The room is so small it's barely enough for 2 people, let alone 3. We booked for 5 nights and there is no space for suitcases whatsoever.

The staff was completely unhelpful and the hotel extremely noisy.",1,1
"Stayed in room 1103 with a view of fire escapes and an empty lot.   The room was ridiculously small (bathroom about 8 inches from one bed), the ""full-length"" mirror was a tiny narrow thing stashed in a cabinet wit no light. There was inadequate space to hang clothing. There was only one towel rack in the bathroom. The mattresses were too soft. At check-in, we had to wait an hour because the room wasn't ready. The front desk clerk explained that check was between 4 and 7 (but shouldn't they have the room ready at 4?) and offered no apology, free upgrade, or free drink for the inconvenience. Nope. Won't stay there again.",2,1
"Half of the hotel faces a construction site, and absolutely unbelievable noise begins at 7 AM. When I called to ask to be moved, they told me they could move me to the other side of the hotel. After I packed and went down to the lobby, I found that they had, in the meantime, given that room to another person--and that there was nothing they could do. I'm not sure why I was deemed less worthy of consideration, but I was. I finally had to book another hotel; the room I was in was uninhabitable. And the management refused to give my money back. One of the worst hotel experiences in my life. If you get up before 7 and don't plan to be in the hotel at all during the day, it's fine. But I'm not exaggerating about the noise--the room was shaking, and I had trouble hearing the front",1,1
"I arrived at the hotel at 11PM.  Was told that they had a ""burst pipe"", room was not available. No sign of burst pipe anywhere.  They sent me to a 2-star in shaky part of town at half the cost.  20 blocks away, noisy. etc... Not what you would expect from a serious establishment.  When I requested a refund they claimed the reservation was non-refundable.  I would stay away.",1,1
"I stayed at the hotel on March 21, 2017. After a late flight, I arrive at approximately 11 pm. The lobby smelled like garbage and was not very tidy. I should have taken that as a sign. The room was tucked around a dark corner by the maintenance closet. Upon entering, I saw that the rugs in the room had visible dirt stains. There was hair all over the bathroom sink and floor. The worst was the hair in one of the beds and the, um, body fluids on the other comforter. The windows had handprints on them and the remote control was greasy. I was too tired to change rooms and also feared that I Waikiki get more of the same or even worse. I highly recommend avoiding this hotel.",1,1
"All of the negative things others have said are true, but I overlooked them at first. Yes, the room had bunk beds and would barely have accommodated two people and two suitcases, but I was one person with no suitcase, so I fit. Yes, it was unbearably noisy starting at 7 a.m., but I was up and out the door at 7:15. I stayed there several nights and was not told about free breakfast until the last one; probably an oversight.  But being charged $150 for smoking in the room, a charge I was not informed of at checkout, is outrageous. I have never had a cigarette in my life, and certainly was not smoking in the room. I called the hotel to dispute the charge and was told that two people confirmed the smell of cigarette smoke in the room. I asked to speak to a manager and was told to",1,1
My stay with the Paul Hotel started off on a bad note - was shown to a room on the 14th floor that smelled like a sewer. I requested a change and was given a room on the second floor. The walls in the hotel are paper thin -so you can hear every cough and conversation. The adjoining room had their tv blaring till 3 am and either the room above or beside had a disco going on until 6:30am. I called down at 3 am to have them investigate - never heard back and the party continued all night. The bathrooms in both rooms have a barrier free shower - which means water spills all over the floor and into toilet area.  I asked them to reduce the rate given the horrible stay. Instead I was offered a 10% discount on my next stay. It was the worst experience of a hotel in NY - and I travel,1,1

Yes, I am a smoker but I NEVER smoked in the room, I ALWAYS went outside to do so.

Then, when I went in my room, the towels were already used and dirty. The rooms are very small. The girls that works at the reception are not so kind. The breakfast is very poor. They also called a taxi for us to go to port authority station: 30 dollars for 5 minutes drive! We won't nevere return in this hotel. The worst service ever!",1,1
Staf is super kind but not informed that housekeeping does not clean  the hotel. I was on the 19th floor and asked 4 times different days of they could clean and dust the room. Last evening of my stay it was done a little.  Got complementary wine and snacks for my anniversary.  Like I said besides housekeeping and cleaning the staff is professional and clean. Had a nice stay,2,1
"Do not stay in this hotel if you have a vehicle to Valet. Also be warned that some rooms only have twin bunk beds in them. I have never seen bunk beds in a 4 star hotel before. I had big issues trying to valet my vehicle. Please see the email I sent to hotel ""I stayed at your hotel on 10/31. I called to inquire about parking options. I was told you had valet. When I arrived the spots in front of the hotel were taken. I called and spoke with front desk who I could see from my vehicle and was told someone would be over to take my truck. I waited 20 minutes and I moved because a traffic cop told me I was in the bike lane. I proceeded to drive around the block and call the front desk asking when my truck would be picked up. The process of waiting and driving around the block",1,1
"The hotel charged my personal card for the room whilst on a business trip, once my employer provided the correct card details they 'refunded' me and charged my company.  HOWEVER, I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE REFUND OF OVER $2000. AND THE PAUL ARE SIMPLY NOT REPLYING, I'VE EMAILED THEM 8 TIMES. It's appalling.  Poor service, long queues and slow service at desk. Breakfast staff nice. Constant drilling from around 5am directly outside the hotel.",1,1
"With Priceline I booked 2 rooms with 2 beds that was listed as 4 STAR for around $200 each room but found out that based on my travel experience it was not 4 STAR in fact 1 room that they gave me should be 1 STAR because it was small and has bunk beds like a  HOSTELS ROOM. The hotel should not list this hotel as a 4 Star if they have these type of small rooms with bunk beds. The lobby is small, front desk set up for 2 people but only 1 person working there, no parking in the area unless you ask for valet parking that has to come from a garage 10-15 minutes out, very small breakfast room with so-so food. One of the two rooms we had did have 2 beds but very little space in it, the other room was the size of a closet in a house with 2 bunk beds in it and a small bathroom. I was mad",2,1
"I will make it short: Stay away.   We booked a room and PAID for it We arrived late - 9pm, which is no crime where I live.  they said they had no room for us due to ""maintenance issues"", and the ONLY option they gave us was to drive us to JFK (!!) which we had to agree after 3 hours of trying to get out of this bad bad situation.  Results: Ruined evening in NYC (our last evening of our vacation) Hours spent driving to the hotel and from the hotel Bottle of wine (ha ha) which they gave us and which we returned the next day before flying back home, AND which I hope they stuck you know where.",1,1
"I chose The Paul because I needed a hotel in convenient distance form my event venue. The description of this hotel sounded very nice. I like boutique style hotels with trendy bars, it's even nice to have a restaurant for breakfast. But all of this was just a big mess. The owner claims to be a ""modern nomad"" checking out the world. Well, I suggest he'd rather stay at home to fix his hotel. My room (307) was basically ok, but super small. It was difficult to place my luggage and still have room to get to the bed. I was travelling with hand luggage.... The room was super noisy as it was facing a huge construction site (not the fault of the hotel of course), but the windows are definitely not sound proof. Breakfast was lousy, the atmosphere a nightmare with loud music. The food",1,1
"We stayed three nights over the past weekend.  I was really surprised how small the room with two double beds was and how difficult it was for three women to share the space.  I noticed a lot of things that could be improved.    It just looks shabby if you look closely.  Scratches on doors, needs paint in places.  The breakfast is a cheap ""Holiday inn"" breakfast not a real cooked breakfast..should have know. I think it is WAY over priced.  DIssappointed in the whole experience",2,1
"This place is a RIP OFF  and clearly deceiving consumers. This was, hands-down, the WORST experience I have ever had with a hotel and I travel a few times a month, because I have an airline pass.  I booked The Paul for 2 nights via Priceline. It was advertised as a 4 star hotel. It is a HOSTEL! Starting from the reception desk, which is dirtier and smaller than that of a motel, with incompetent and unfriendly service, to the rooms which are smaller than a Hampton's Inn bathroom and have BUNK BEDS. Not cute, whimsical, optional bunk beds. These are prison-style, cheaper than Ikea BUNK BEDS in their STANDARD rooms. The reason for this? A regular full size bed WOULD NOT FIT. I'm only 5'6 and I tried to stretch my arms side to side. THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH ROOM, they are that small. To",1,1
"I went with my best friend to NYC for a week. We spent 7 nights in the hotel, thinking it was a 4 star hotel (and paying USD 280 per night, accordingly). Well, IT ISN'T. The room doesn't have any room to move, the space between the bed and the bathroom door is LITERALLY 30 centimetres wide. NOT KIDDING. It's so small the bathroom door is slidable, because if it weren't, you wouldn't be able to open it. The staff is bad tempered at best. They provide bad service AND they are understaffed. Every time you go to the reception, there are at least 4 people in line.  Breakfast is OK for a Holiday Inn. NOT FOR A 4 STAR HOTEL.  TV has 20 channels. That's it. The AAC determines by itself if it's going to cook you or freeze you to death. It's impossible to regulate. Either you sweat, or",2,1
"A pile driver digging for a new skyscraper across the street is a major problem for this hotel as of October 2016, and for who knows how long to get that building into the ground. Another problem is that the scale of the entire hotel is tiny, veering into cramped. Two of us in room with stacked bunkbeds was difficult. Most of the staff was helpful  and attentive. Our room was very dark. The target audience seems to be young travelers. I did meet interesting young people at the bar while waiting for the room to be ready for us. But car alarms, shrieking, and loud music from the bar on the patio continued late into the night. The design was hip, but execution lacking. The tile stuff up 1/3 of an inch above the laminate wood planks. If you plan to be away all day and evening it's",2,1
"I booked a one night for me and my wife at this ""hotel"".  They categorize themselves as a 4 star which it is definitely not.  It is a 2 star at best.  The room was uncomfortably small and dirty.  I requested a queen size bed and was given two bunkbeds. I had to sleep on a different bed than my wife on our romantic couples trip.  The staff member did not care at all for this dilemma.  The room makes you feel suffocated and you can not move around.  I had to shower with the curtain open because I did not fit, and I am of average size.  The staff does not know the meaning of customer service at all.  They were all rude and did not seem to want to be there.  We got woken up at 7am due to the construction next to the hotel.  The breakfast was below mediocre.  This is definitely NOT a",1,1
"Major issue is the noise and dust from the major construction going on across the street. Guests should receive a warning and a rebate. Still the price we paid was $300+ per night. Incessant hammering starts at 7:30 am and goes on till 5:30 pm. Windows are dirty and dust is present in common areas. To add to all that check-in time is 4:00 pm. We did not have time to prepare for our early evening appointment (they only let us in after 4). Location is trending, but it not enough to offset the downsides. I don't think is right not to warn customers in such a situation.",1,1
"There is a skyrise building coming up across the street.  I would have had a better sleep in downtown Aleppo, Syria.  Excavation has started, and by 7am, you will not sleep a wink.  It was disingenuous to not mention this before booking.  The guest services manager, blew off my request for modest reimbursement.  When I called back the next week, he feigned inability to do so, offering a minor reimbursement on future stays and a bottle of wine.  The thing is I will never stay there again.  If you want rest, do NOT stay at this hotel.  At least ask about the construction, not that you'll get an honest answer.",1,1
"The Paul Hotel is a well located hotel with outstanding views from around Manhattan, including a wonderful view of the Empire State building, for now until they finish the building in front of the hotel. My purpose for choosing this hotel was definitely location, going for the first time to NYC for the Home Textile Market Week was a very important opportunity for me and my company and I really needed to be on my 100% to get my work done successfully. The hotel lack of staff at the entrance makes the arrival unwelcoming, more if you have luggage and a very NYC impatient taxi driver. The lobby is very modern with a lot of character; no big enough to help more than two people at the time, but the staff is fast enough to compensate for the lack of space. This is a very old building",2,1
"after checking in a few hours later than check in time there was trash on the table from a fast food place and when we called down to the front desk, they said to just wait they would send someone up. They sent house keeping manager, she inspected the room and then told us to wait in the room and they will clean it. This is a NYC hotel there is hardly room for two people and she wanted us to sit there while she had someone clean it. I called to the front desk and asked for a new room and they instantly said they would send someone up to give us a key for a new room. This would not bother me normally but we were in a hurry to get to dinner reservations and still needed to get ready.",2,1
"Friendly staff, clean rooms, however, I recommend that you check your bathroom before you settle in.  Our shower was broken and the toilet backed up twice. Also, noisy location, if you are a light sleeper.",2,1
"Called ahead for valet parking. Called when we areived put on hold 15mins while circling the block. Told to pull over n come inside to check in? Parked in front of hotel. Asked if ok n was told to pay meter in am. Cops were about to boot car in am said never could i park there, ticket for $115, on top of this hotel charged $55 valet for the 3 hrs we had left in the city. I tried to call manager and he put me on hold for over an hour- never picked up! Staff were unaware, unattentive, one front desk lady was helpful- wish i knew her name, but that was all. Front desk was aparently the manager? He was aloof, never gave us breakfast tockets so we missed breakfast. Air conditioner ""sometimes"" worked, room was smaaaallll! But we had a great deal on room, at least we thought until we",1,1
"The only positive thing is the location close to the Empire State..... But if you are looking for a hotel worth the price, you are wrong here.... The rooms are so tiny that even for a single person it is too small... Also if you are looking for a good sleep you will also be disappointed since the walls are so thin you can hear every single word from the next room! Also housekeeping is nearly an option, don't count on it before 5pm! Definitely do not recommend!",1,1
You get what you pay for. A cheap and clean hotel with few amenities. The biggest bug bear was the fact that they frequently went down to one elevator which made the only other small elevator work a bit too hard. On one occasion I waited for what felt like an eternity to get to my room. The staff were indifferent at best. It was not great.,2,1
"More than 200 bucks for a place just like a youthhostel - that`s al lot  - even for NYC and  Midtown Manhattan. The place was extremly noisy, breakfast not very good. The roof top ist closed in the evening - what a pitty!",2,1
"Good location, decent room rate, clean and a well-appointed, though small, room. All of these things made me like the hotel. But then the fire alarm shrieked on at 2 a.m. After a while, the intercom announced that it was nothing serious. Five minutes later, as we were trying to get back to sleep, it went off AGAIN. After a while, the intercom announced it had been a false alarm. All this time I tried to call the front desk, but never reached an actual human being. When we checked out the next day, there was no mention of the disruption or offer to provide an adjustment of the bill. So, while the hotel was otherwise nice, I would not stay there again.",2,1
"I was looking forward to staying at this hotel after reading many positive things on this property and what the hotel was offering on their website. However my experience was not what I was hopping for. My hotel room was not available until 5:30pm, I had also requested an early check-in.(they did offer a free drink while I was waiting for the room) Got to the room and there was not fridge mean while my reservation said the room had a fridge. Later that night I requested  a fridge which never showed up and no one followed up with me. The next day I left a note for the maid for an extra pillow and a fridge and I did not get either. Later when i got back the key to the room didn't work so I had to go to the front desk for a new card. That evening I went back to the front desk to",1,1
"I had a request for this hotel, and I had been emailing them for over 2 weeks with not getting any reply, also been on hold for over 10 minutes, with calling the hotel multiple times where the reception promised me that I would get a answer and i never recieved one. It does not seem like they care about guests, and what guests thinks of them. I have got a really bad impression about this hotel, service must be improved.",1,1
"Booked 1 night, arrived on 5/16, the last day of our vacation in NYC. They had maintenance issues and had to relocate us to another hotel. The Paul sent us to the Clarion Hotel on Park Ave, a DUMP! I had to find my own hotel around 11pm. They charged my nieces credit card, placed a hold on my funds for the card that was on file. The Paul was supposed to take care of the bill at the hotel we stayed at...never did. After 3 weeks they have finally credited the card, but, then they turned around and charged my card? I called them and was told that they did not charge my account. It is clearly showing up on my account. Have had to call my bank...they ruined our last night in the city, and I am still dealing with the charges. Have to sit and wait to see if the charge will go through!",1,1
"We arrived at 11PM from the airport & were told that there was a leak in the hotel & that our room (which we had booked for months) was unavailable.  They told us they would cover us for a 1.7 star-rated hotel in the Bronx instead.  Not only is this significantly worse (location & star-wise) than we had planned for, but the hotel had about 12 hours to notify us about this, as check out time (the time they would have noticed the leak) was 11 am.  I completely understand that accidents can happen, but from the way  it was handled it was either a lie & they over-booked, or it is just a horribly run hotel.  Either way, we took our business elsewhere & I would NEVER consider this company again.",1,1
"I made a reservation based on the reviews and location. I arrived late, maybe a bit after midnight, and found the neighborhood to be just on the wrong side of 29th.  I had to make my way around the security guard who had his back to the entrance and was blocking the receptionist view of the entry - a regular station for him it seems like. The elevators and stairs are open to the public so it's not secure. Got to my room which had a housekeeping cart planted against the door. The room looked made up but was dirty and still had someone's clothes in the closet. The bathroom was dirty, looked like it just had a towel change and that was it. I went back down to ask for a room change, made my way around the security guard's back and got a new room which was dirtier than the first.",2,1
"I had booked The Paul in February through Hotwire.com, but the hotel charged me a second time without authorization. Despite admitting guilt, they have yet to issue a refund for their error.  When we checked in, they gave my husband and I a room with bunk beds. When asked if there was an available room with a queen or king bed, they moved us to a room with a broken shower. The location of the hotel was the only reason I gave this hotel more than 1 star. Will not stay here again.",2,1
Didn't have great experience. First off the receptionist told me the two rooms I had booked had been cancelled. After 50 minutes they came back and said they found the booking but the rooms we ordered where not available. So ended up in a twin room for the night before getting proper room next again day. They also failed to mention there was building work going on at either side of the hotel  so at 7am sharp every morning at jack hammer would wake you up and the noise would pretty much continue until 4 pm.,2,1
"The good was hotel was clean and conveniently located. The bad...well the worst part was the jack hammer literally outside the window of room 902. It started at 7am which was tough for someone from west coast. It was so loud I could not even talk on the phone. I realize the hotel can't control NYC construction however they could have provided a pre arrival warning and allow someone to cancel if their plans included working in the room or sleeping past 7am. They did not warn me prior to arrival, nor did they say a word about it upon check in nor was there an apology letter from the GM in the room. The only day they don't operate the jack hammers is Sunday. They offered to change my room but I was so frustrated (maybe lack of sleep!!) that I decided to check out. Check in was not",1,1
"Firstly let me say that Marie is the best thing about this hotel. She is the only one at reception that is friendly and can help you with whatever you need. I hope they appreciate her and realise what she means to that hotel.  Room: Small as per usual in New York, everything is modern and nice. Bathroom is also small be very functional. The heater in our room didn’t work properly so wasn’t too happy.   Location: Good location, walking distance to Times Square, Macey’s etc.   Breakfast: Disgusting. It was free and we still didn’t go there after 3 days. The muffins and pastry’s where all stale. Pancakes as hard as cardboard. The really need to look at the quality of the breakfast as it was seriously bad.  Price: Very good for the area.  Room Cleaners: All excellent and very",2,1
"Rooms are loud, very loud! All King rooms are disability rooms (not disclosed by hotel prior to booking).  Inconsistent water temperature.  Loud internal heating/cooling fans inside room (i.e. no ducted air con). We were downgraded after requesting room change with no response to our queries and are still waiting for a refund for the higher room charge. Just very disappointing - you have been warned !",1,1
Nice hotel . Rooms are nice . Although not always warm water in the shower.    Breakfast included is nothing much. At least for European people. Bagel coffee and jam .....????  Staff at the reception is not to bright.  Manager + 2 assistants trying to figure out why we are booked with four people in a 4 people room . Instead of 2 doubles like the confirmation said. Took them almost 3 days. In the meantime charging double. Never leave your credit card behind.  They won't just reserve the money.  They charge it. And then try to get it back.  You ll lose the valuta for sure.   But what surprised me most. My brother send me bottle of champagne by courier from Holland for my birthday 31st of december.  But although I had confirmation that the hotel received it . They never gave it to,2,1
"I discovered this hotel thru a deal from Travelzoo. Location and service were great. The room was clean, new and functional. However, it was the noisiest hotel room I have stayed my life. They failed on the soundproof area: police/firefighters sirens kept me away until the wee hours of the night. I could hear my neighbour activity the entire night. To make things worse, there is a ground-up building construction (March 10, 2016) JUST in front of this hotel that starts activity very early in the morning.   I got impressed by the looks of the place and very disappointed by the experience. A hotel room whole purpose is to provide a restful night and this one failed to deliver.",2,1
"There's simply no way that a hotel at this star/price level can justify a $150 deposit for incidentals for a one-night-stay. The 4-star and up places that do charge hefty deposits as such use whatever service that returns them the next day. Paul Hotel takes 10 days+ to return an unjustifiably high amount. I didn't even have a minibar in my room, but one of my 3 TVs was thoughtfully not working.    This is especially true when one is put up in a crapulent, cramped bunk-bed room that looks and feels like it was designed for an aging hipster's grandchildren. Add to that a toilet and and shower crammed behind a closet door and charmless hotel staff who sneer at simple questions like, ""Is Paul a person, or a marketing fiction?"" (he left a lot of creepy notes in my room, inviting",1,1
"We tried to have dinner in the Mexican restaurant located in the lobby. We were told that the chef had left.  We thought we would have a drink, and were told that the bartender was out looking for the chef (sounds like a bad joke!).  We decided to eat someplace else.  The rooms are tiny and the plumbing needs attention.  The toilet didn't flush properly and we had to take cold showers.",2,1
"Despite the already somewhat late check-in time (4 PM), much to our dismay, we were informed when we arrived that we would still need to wait 5 minutes for our room and that they would come get us. We were a little aggravated since we had 2 young children with us and the waiting space they offered was an area by the bar with a couch that was already filling up with others who were also waiting for their room. As the 5 minutes stretched to 15 and then 20 minutes, my husband decided to go wait by the front desk as it was possible that they had forgotten about us since the waiting area was far removed from the front desk. As I continued to wait, I learned from the staff that this was a daily occurrence and that the average wait time was 45 minutes to an hour for a room. I guess we",2,1
"Things started out quite well at the hotel: the room was modern and stylish, we had a great view of the Empire State building on a high floor. My boyfriend reminded the hotel about my birthday, and they decorated the room with balloons and left us a bottle of champagne, which was very thoughtful.  Then I woke up with bite marks on my feet. This was very troubling in and of itself, but was made worse by the fact that the hotel didn't seem to take it very seriously. The desk agent said she would have the hotel's engineer take a look at the room, and then told us she had no other queen rooms, so maybe we would prefer to stay in the room until he looked at it. We said that we definitely wanted to change rooms, and I had to push to get another room (albeit a double) on a high floor.",2,1
We arrived at the hotel and missed it twice while driving by as it appeared that the front of the facility was under construction. The hotel is not advertised properly as there were scaffolding in front and no proper sinage. I wanted valet parking and had to wait 15 minutes parked in the street for the attendant to come from a garage. During that time I had to make the block again to allow the flow of traffic. While I booked my hotel I requested an early check in which I was consistently told to check back every hour. Eventually I ended up checking in at the hotel time of 4PM. The front desk clerk was not accommodating as I mentioned to her I've been waiting to check in since 1PM. Check out time for this hotel is 11AM. The restaurant to the back is completely  different in terms,1,1
"I like to write positive reviews, and try to find good things to say about everyplace I stay or eat, or visit. So, I'll begin with the good news: the staff at The Paul is very responsive, helpful, and friendly. Having said that, the management should really be aware that their staff needs help. The line at check-in is ridiculously long for the digital age, and we waited 50 minutes for the contracted valet service to pick up our car. That's not a great beginning to a long weekend in the city. At breakfast, when asked for cream cheese for our bagels, it was happily brought, but we were told they don't just put it out on the buffet witht he bagels because it is too expensive.  We had an ironing board, but no iron, and it took two phone calls to have it delivered. The room was nice,",2,1
"31 August- 6 September 2015 Invited family to N.Y. so I got 2 rooms. TWICE we had NO room service. WE had to call in order to get clean towels, soap, toilet tissue and the basic items! Left message for manager to call me while we were still in N.Y. and never heard from her. Got home, called the OWNER but was never available so they gave me his email address. emailed him and never got a response. The rooms are micro size, only the bed fits-no joke! so imagine having to be jumping over 2 days of dirty towels and overflowing trash cans!!  NEVER AGAIN.",1,1
"It's in a good spot if you're wanting to go uptown and downtown but it's incredibly noisy all the time and I barely got any sleep as a result.  The rooms are so small that there's actually nowhere to lay down a suitcase. The use of the minimal is bad with an enormous air conditioner that is complete overkill for the room and is either off or blasting cold air at you....there seemed to be no happy medium.  The included 'breakfast' was insulting. Think purchased baked goods, no fruit or anything, served on plastic plates purchased from a supermarket in a room with low rent outdoor furniture. It was appalling.  All in all a very disappointing hotel and I wouldn't stay there again.",2,1
"A family members room better than ours but we had no closet just a small cupboard. The bathroom floor had no separation from the walk in shower so the entire floor flooded after showers, no washcloths always had to call and request. Not a bad location but better hotels for the price in my opinion. The staff was very nice.",2,1
"I can't lie - I really didn't enjoy my stay. It wasn't terrible, but it really missed the mark for me. First, when we got there, I noticed a door connecting to another room. It was unlocked on our side. Yes, of course I locked it, but if I hadn't been paying attention, I would have gone to sleep with the potential for the person in the next room to walk right in. Maybe that seems petty, but creepy things are known to happen now and then. I expect my hotel to look out for my safety. To have the staff leave the room vulnerable that way was careless. We got an accessible room which we didn't request, but that usually doesn't present any problem for me. This room had a bathroom that I really can't imagine working well for someone using a wheelchair. There was no place to put",2,1
"Very disappointing stay. Poor service and it was so noisy that I had to cut short my stay. Worse of all, the numerous sleepless nights made me sick. I wrote in to the guest service manager, but did not get any response at all. Prior to my stay, when i asked for an option to reach their hotel, they did not reply me as well. When i called, they say i should have contacted them earlier and i said i did! Not only did they not apologise, but just simply state that they can only get a shuttle, not even offering any options or directions to their place.",1,1
If you're traveling to New York City let me be the first one to tell you to choose some where else to stay. The location is decent but that's about the only perk for this place. My family of 3 traveled to New York City with high hopes of a fantastic trip but left very disappointed. Upon our check-in we were very specific about which credit card we wanted to use. Even though we handed the lady at the desk our card she proceeded and charged a totally different card which in turn caused us a huge headache and numerous non-refundable fees. Instead of her apologizing for her mistake she continued to not take responsibility and blame the computer. She said it was the systems fault. Let me explain that we are not new travelers. We travel as much as possible and this was the 1st stop,1,1
"View photos.   Booked from Saturday June 20th 'til Wednesday June 24th for 250$ a night. Ended up paying more...   Leisure trip for 2 adults. Been to city plenty of times before. We are in our late 20's.  Flew into LGA, hailed a taxi to the hotel for 50$. Road was closed on June 20th for the construction of a new hotel across the street from The Paul. I did not know. I dragged two suitcases and a carry on down the block in  around the corner to check in. Not their fault. Just letting travelers know.   The service desk is small and to the right. It had sticky juice and crumbs all over where you lean to sign. I made a comment politely about it so they would know for the next guest and the guy just snapped at me. Anyways... My room I booked online was not ready. I was there after",2,1
"We booked the ""best"" room in the hotel and by best I mean the most expensive. This room has a terrace and king size bed. The bathroom was poorly designed. When we took showers the whole bathroom would flood making it a safety hazard. We asked to please be moved to the other terrace suite and they did but the back door to the terrace would not lock. The maintenance people told us the hotel management was well aware of this for several weeks now but nothing had been done. I guess they were hoping we didn't notice.  We were moved again but they didn't have any more king size beds so we got a tiny room with a queen bed and the only thing they did for us was refund one night stay.  We paid full price for the priciest room and ended up staying 5 nights in the worst room.  During our",1,1
"Booked a one night stay for a business meeting I had in the area. When I arrived, I was told I didn't have a room. I understand this sometimes unfortunately happens, but what should also happen at that point is a sincere apology and a care for what happens next. Neither of those things occurred. The fact that a heads up call or email prior to my arrival to let me know of the problem was also not a consideration, added to the unprofessionalism. As a final cherry on the top, they were very rude to the desk personnel at the  ""sister"" hotel they sent me to 12 blocks north when they called the next day to confirm the charges. These things happen, but they don't need to happen like this.",1,1
"Yes it is new, yet it is central but here is where the positive things about this hotel stop. Oh and the amazing view to the Empire State Building if you're lucky enough to get a room in one of the top floors (16 and up). But note, the exterior of the windows is extremely (dusty watermarks) dirty so this does obstruct that view a little, but still...The front desk staff is friendly but basically inefficient and unable to deal with simple everyday requests. Cleanliness is patchy and below standard. Which means, we found hair in the toilet, plenty of dust (hubbie was sneezing all night) but at least linen was clean - thank God. No shampoo and no shower gel for us during our 3 night stay - bottles were there but empty. No cups in the room. Not a shower cap either and the showerhead",2,1
"Even though the rooms are clean and this is a new hotel... I would still recommend you find another hotel.   Apart from finding out that there is no resturant open here so room service is not an option ( unless you want a macdonalds around the corner), there is also no city information pack to read through (just a A4 piece of paper with basic hotel info and I mean basic) and there is not enough storage space in the room for a single person traveling...... Just imagine what it would be like if it was a couple.  My advise would find a suitable hotel that has all the facilities you require because there website is a bit misleading too.",2,1
When you first enter in the lobby it’s lovely and the staff are very friendly but as soon as you go to your room there’s where its bad the paint on the wall is peeling and its really dark the air conditioning has a knob what you turn its not modern at all and the bathroom’s door paint is peeling up I will never stay in this hotel anymore.,1,1
I went to the NYC with my mom and sister and stayed at the Empire hotel. This was deemed a 4 star hotel..it deserves 1! The lobby and front desk staff were lovely and the location is great but that’s where the compliments end. The rooms are super small and dark. The lighting was terrible. Our showers were luke warm at best the entire 3 days. The bathroom was only big enough for 1 person to enter at a time. The beds were double not queen. The air conditioner/ heater was an old unit with a dial and though we had the temperature at the lowest setting it was still really hot in the room. The blind in the room on the one window randomly fell so it was all the way down and it was so old it didn’t go back up. The furniture is all really old. One of our lamps looked like it would fall,1,1
"Disgusting. Just purely unbearable. Unbelievably dirty. Can’t believe this city keeping these places remain open and calling them hotels. Can’t believe this. Extremely dirty. Garbage on the floor. I can’t believe this. The garbage from the previous guest was witnessed at the same hotel series in Lenox. I feel like I was pushed into the very worst thing to face about the United States. Oh my God, dirty. This is just disgusting. No way.",1,1
"I normally don't write reviews but was so disappointed with my stay on so many different fronts that I wanted to share my experience.  My wife and I and two small kids were promised adjoining rooms.  On check-in, one was ready and the other was not.  When we came back that night, we were given a key to the second room and when we walked it -- there were animals in it (a dog and a cat) and it was disgusting.  The prior guests had not moved out and we were not notified of this in advance so we could make other arrangements.  When we told the front desk, they were not particularly helpful and it took numerous follow-up attempts before they rebooked us.  The bellman never showed up as promised to help us move our luggage so we moved it ourselves.  And calls to the front desk were",1,1
"An Instagram v reality hotel - looks great on the outside & in the lobby, but beyond that it is in need of some serious TLC. The rooms are dated & we had to call reception at 2am for assistance to get some air into the room as it was too hot & the rickety unit was shut off. The view from the room window would have been great if it was clean and the wifi was the worst I’ve used on my travels for years, making the “resort fee” all the more laughable. Furthermore, unlike any other hotel I’ve travelled to across the world, the reception at check out didn’t remind/inform me that I had to pay that “resort fee”, so I’ve just seen it pop up on my credit card bill (that card was holding card for incidentals rather than the one I would pay with given I also incurred a nice non-Sterling",2,1
"Horrible. I checked in, got ready for an event (happy I showered that morning at home) and couldn’t even sleep there the night I was so grossed out. It’s as if they only care about the lobby and not where guests stay. Hope you don’t want to be able to see through the window too - it was like the scene from my cousin Vinny.",1,1
"Do not stay here unless you're absolutely desperate, even then, keep looking elsewhere.  Keep in mind, none of these issues would be relevant at $90/ night, but with the rates these people charge their service is disgusting.   They have a policy not to give guests more than two bottles of water which is insane. They refuse to answer the phone if you call the front desk and are rude when you ask simple questions.   It's incredibly frustrating to pay so much for a room so tiny that you have to step over the toilet into the tub to close the restroom door.",1,1
"Like the people in the most recent reviews, I have also been trying to get a refund for my stay that I couldn't complete because the hotel was closed.  I booked a trip in March and have been going back and forth in emails for EIGHT MONTHS trying to get my refund. Each time, I am just told that my refund request has been sent to ""upper management"". At this point, I hesitate to believe any management exists at this property.  It is just a run-around with no resolution. These people have probably gotten away with taking dozens, if not more, people's money... during a pandemic when people need their money the most.   Horrible customer service, horrible policies, and most likely horrible people. I never leave bad reviews for places, but I felt like I should warn others. I have been",1,1
I had booked a trip here for July which got subsequently cancelled. I’ve sent the hotel countless emails which all get the same response. Refund request with ‘upper management’ Absolutely useless.  I think in these trying times a company’s response is very indicative of what they truly think of their customers and their attitude is shocking. Constantly fobbed off and no one can be bothered to do anything. Never ever book here.,1,1
"We received an email from the hotel reservation department in June cancelling our stay for July due to closing for COVID (understandable). The email stated we could keep the price of the stay as credit for a future stay or take a full refund.  We opted for a refund.  Since then, after countless emails over the past fifteen weeks the decision is still with ""upper management"" whoever this may be.  Absolutely no update on timescales other than the above reply to each email. The hotel have cancelled the stay and offered the refund, so provide the refund.  Absolutely horrendous customer service, wont be going in future out of principle. Looking online it appears there's plenty in the same boat as us.",1,1
"We booked in February for a stay in July. With COVID our flights were cancelled and we asked for a refund for the hotel stay in March. It has been months and countless emails that just tell me they are waiting on the approval from upper management.  Literally, probably 15 emails back and forth asking for status updates and refunds. The hotel was not even open for the stay we had paid for in July!! I am very disappointed. Completely ridiculous that they will not refund our money when they weren’t even open. To me, that’s stealing... I have paid for a service and it was not given to me.",1,1
"Don't book this hotel. Shocking Customer service. Had 6 nights booked for July 2020. They cancelled have failed to give a refund. Cant get response, being told by reservations that our request is being ""referred to upper management!"". Refused direct email contact to them. Wont provide complaints procedure. Diabolical. Book somewhere else for peace of mind of better customer service!  Would have given zero circles but wasn't an option!",1,1
"Absolutely loved my stay here, couldn’t have picked a fault with location / hotel etc until I arrived at the airport realising my airpods were gone from my bag.  i did not check if my airpods were in my bag as they had not been used or left my bag in the whole time i was in NYC.  I contacted the hotel and they weren’t helpful at all - airpods have been removed from Find my iPhone which after speaking to apple support means someone has them and has reset them. Extremely disappointed with the response as they were removed during my stay I would have thought the hotel may have been more helpful.  We 10000% checked everywhere in the room so they were not left at all - checked under the bed and every possible place things could’ve been left.  Very unhappy guest!",2,1
Very rude staff Small rooms they don’t face anything nice you just look at a wall overpriced breakfast management that can’t call you back or do their job worst hotel I’ve ever stayed or will never be going back to this hotel ever again they should not call at the Empire Hotel that’s an insult to the USA,1,1
"We arrived late to our room after a night out. I have stayed here numerous times so this last visit was a surprise how dirty our room was. I didn’t notice until the next morning when I was in the bathroom. The bathroom door was grimy with finger prints all over it an some kind of spillage on the bottom of the door, the cabinets didn’t look like they had ever been wiped down,but the truly disgusting thing was the toilet seat lid. RealIy really grimy! I sent  a letter to the hotel manager, and to her credit, she called our room right aware and assured me everything would be taken care of right away. When we returned to our room there was a hand written note with an apology and some treats. But the room was still dirty.the bottom of the door had been cleaned. Dirty fingerprints",1,1
I have stayed at hotels across the world and this is the first time I have ever had a room that doesn't offer top sheets on the bed unless requested. Not informed of this when I checked in.   Absurd and a cheap way to save a few bucks.   First and last time in this property.,1,1
"First room was 85 degrees. Maintenance came in at 3am to fix it and said they couldn't. Second night we were moved to another room. Loud loud loud clicking noises all night! We called the front desk and told them and they were like ""yeah this is just an old building it makes loud noises at night"" THANKS FOR NOTHING",1,1
"We booked this hotel for its proximity to Lincoln Center, and it did have that in its favor, but that was the only thing.  The heating unit in our first room was so noisy that we could hardly hear ourselves.  We went to the front desk and had to persuade the person there to give us another room.  In that one, the heating unit made a clanking noise that kept up awake at night.  We also asked the front desk person where to buy a bottle of wine and were sent on a wild goose chase down Columbus Ave.",2,1
"I booked my room and paid in full online, all fees included according to the contract, but was charged an additional resort fee.  When I inquired about the additional charge, the manager was rude and dismissive and offered no explanation.  Also, hotel staff entered my room unexpectedly, without knocking, while I was in it .  I had not called for any sort of room service.",2,1
"I was in New York on business and the closest hotel to the venue at which I was working was The Empire. The place is nice and my checkin went smoothly. I slept pretty well. I woke up and went to the gym located within the hotel. Half the weights were missing and the treadmill kept getting stuck. This may seem inconsequential for most however I travel quite a bit for work and book conditionally on the fact that there is a gym on the premises so I can maintain a modicum of normalcy while traveling. So when the equipment was not so great, I was a bit displeased. However I kept up my optimism because I figured it wasn't all bad. Then I got to my room, and decided it was time for a good old fashioned shower. That idea quickly fell flat because the shower head was busted. It did",2,1
"Visited here late January... hotel reception it lovely, staff are very friendly, which is a big shock as everyone in NY are rude! But every staff member we spoken to was so nice! 5 minute walk from central park, 15 minute walk to time square! So great location, they also have a roof top bar which was very nice but expensive, HOWEVER the rooms are VERY POOR! , so small no where to store any clothes, dated heating system blows out cold air for 5 minutes and then blows out cold, bathrooms are tiny and not very clean, although the shower is very powerful that was probably the only good thing about the room, and also the hall ways are very dated, i feel like all the money they have they have put into the lobby and roof top, looks like two completely different hotels   Wouldnt stay",2,1
Well my girlfriend and I decided to stay at the empire hotel in Manhattan but before we decided to stay she showed me pictures of the hotel and it looked amazing the colors were bright and beautiful i told her i didnt want to stay at  a place where the colors were dark and dull so the empire was definitely not that from the pictures that I saw and it looked updated and the rooms looked modern  and well kept so before we got to the hotel my girlfriend called to ask if we can check in early our check in time wasn't until 3pm they said that they couldn't tell us over the phone we would have to go to the hotel so we drove from Jersey to Manhattan only to find out that we have to wait for an hour and half to check in so we sat around because we had no where to go and nodded off,2,1
"Usually in previous stays in the Empire, I have been pleased with the room and never experienced such a disaster as a heater that would not turn off.  I felt like I was at a stifling summer camp. This room and other rooms on the same floor that were west facing all had issues with overheating.  Windows were inoperable.  I have in the past praised this hotel, but watch out for a miserable room assignment. I will go back because of the proximity to the Met Opera and the opportunities offered for entertainment at Lincoln Center.  Next time, I'll be on guard against a raunchy room assignment, as you should be!.",1,1
It was terrible air control quality. There is no water given and you’re charged for extra toilet paper. Room smelt of mold and was the size of a shoe closet. $150 refundable deposit on room in case of any damages when everything in the room is worth less than stuff you’d find in a dollar store.,2,1
"Stay away at all costs   Valet broke my windshield, hotel gave me their number. Can only speak to a “manager” who apparently only works a couple of days a week. The guys there just hang up on you. Hotel manager doesn’t return phone calls. Stay far away from this horrible establishment.",1,1
"I dont understand how they even sell such kind of rooms.   Horrible noise. The worst 500 usd i spent for two nights.   Tried to change rooms, the registration person said that what my rate gives.   Make your own decision on this",1,1
This was the filthiest room I have ever stayed in! The shower was so gross I didn’t even use it. I was so surprised that hotel of this type at Lincoln Square would have rooms like that. Unacceptable!!,1,1
"Stayed here as part of our honeymoon visit to New York and felt compelled to write a review. The location of the hotel is fine and the rooftop bar and lobby area are good however would never stay here again. Our room and bathroom were tiny, our AC didn’t work and when a member of staff told us he would get it sorted, we were greeted to a knock at our door an hour later and another member of staff holding a tiny heater - no explanation given and he just walked off! We were also in a room that had what sounded like a generator running constantly and it was unbearably loud. We decided, at 12.00am on our first night in New York, that we couldn’t stay there as we knew it would likely ruin our entire trip so we arranged to go to another hotel that night. On checking out, the staff at",1,1
"Worst experience I’ve had at a hotel. They lost our reservation from booking.com and when we finally checked in the room we got was very obviously the room that’s never been updated since this hotel opened. The bathroom door was molding and falling apart and the shower never actually got any hotter than lukewarm. The thermostat was ripped off the wall and when we turned on the heater manually it started spewing smoke, we notified the front desk who had maintenance come and say there was nothing they could do. Hotel staff was rude and very obviously would rather do anything but help you. You’re much better off staying anywhere else but here.",1,1
"For a 4-star hotel, the amenities are subpar: The provided refrigerators don't cool down below 50°F (I had a thermometer on my keychain), which management should make clear to guests. In fact, I had them send up a second after the first didn't cool down enough, but all are of the same model, which are only suitable to ""chill"" drinks and candy bars typically found in a mini bar. I had counted on the fridge to store breakfast items (e.g,. yogurt, cold cuts, etc.) as well as leftovers and basically all of them were of questionable safety after one night in the fridge. No coffee maker or hot water kettle were provided. The fitness room was left unkempt: no towels and no wipes on the two days I visited. Subpar lighting and insufficient outlets, especially near the bed. Doors slam",2,1
"The sink didn’t drain, ac didn’t cool even in 40 degree weather.  Lighting was horrible, couldn’t even find clothes in the suitcase with the lighting.  The light over the shower was completely exposed, and a fire hazard.  Every pillow we had was horrible.  Housekeeping was amazing and always helpful.",2,1
"I found a tick in my room. The manager refused to compensate me saying, ""We'll have to investigate it first."" This is after I handed here a plastic bag with a live tick in it. Earlier, when I told my colleagues I was staying at the Empire, my colleagues asked me if I had bug spray. So this is a well-known issue. I recommend you stay there if you like tick-borne diseases.",1,1
"We had a suite, so the room size was good, and location is ok, but based on the following issues, I would not recommend this hotel: - Heater - the first night one of our heaters was broken, so they came to fix it.  However, the other heater made such a horribly loud noise that it kept us up all night, which with a 2 year old was a nightmare.  We asked for it to be fixed, and they said that is just the way the old steam heaters work, so we ended up sleeping without heat the next 2 nights.  It was better to be freezing that not sleep due to the horrid noise. - Check in - room was not ready until 30 min after check out time.  Would not have been a huge deal, but in combination with everything else, it was just one more negative - Bathroom - Felt dingy, and there was a rusty",2,1
"This hotel is a disgusting rip off. I just checked into a tiny room that is not  clean.  A former tenants bathroom articles are still on the shelves in a bathroom so small that I have to go out of it in order to turn around. If I hadn’t booked a non refundable ( but still expensive!)  Expedia price I would leave immediately, but I’m stuck here for 6 nights",1,1
"Was there for WOBI Conference across the street at Lincoln Center. Didn’t sleep a wink as the street noise from the 7th floor was as if we were actually on Broadway and not in an expensive hotel. Woke up to shower and get ready for the big first day and there was no water! Called the front desk, but they never picked up the damn phone! Went down to complain and they said they had no idea as they hadn’t received a complaint. No kidding! You didn’t answer the phone! Had to go to battle with management to get refunded. No one wants to unpack and then change hotels, but that is exactly what we did. The place is small, dark, and in need of maintenance. Front desk and door staff were polished, but it seems like they know the place kind of stinks. Too bad as it’s a great location. The",1,1
The lobby is very nice and of course the location is great but the rooms suck and the manager and staff simply don't care. Was put in a handicap room with this weird diagonal shape and the worst bed you've ever slept on with tears in the bed skirts. Asked for a new room and the Manager simply told me that in 3 nights from now the hotel is oversold and didn't want to move me 2 nights later.  Do yourself a favor and just stay somewhere else.  Your back will thank you!!,2,1
"Booked online through ‘last minute.com’ first time visiting NYC as a family and I am appalled!  The lobby is beautiful which draws you in however the rooms we got were awful! Not 4 star at all.... The curtains are dirty, the walls had marks on it, the pillow cases had marks of makeup left on it, the mirror in the bathroom is rusted and the mirror in the room was not cleaned at all and the door in the bathroom needs to be repainted. I feel that I have wasted 5days here and wasted money that could’ve gone towards a better hotel and a much better room.   When I put the complaint to the manager they showed me alternative rooms which were EXACTLY the same as the room I currently have and in he exact same state! I felt insulted and quite frustrated as we was on a flight for over 8",2,1
It’s nothing fancy. Or posh that’s for sure. It’s a place to lie your tired body down. This was one of the places offered to us at a discount for HSS. It’s not that much of a discount either. Nor close to HSS. It’s a 2 hours walk and 35 minute ride with the traffic. Rugs and window blinds pretty but very very dirty. Very tiny room. Very tiny bathroom. Vanities are cheap wood and tiny being so tiny they should be water proof or steam proof. No coffee station in the hotel. There’s Starbucks next door. Wasn’t an enjoyable place to stay for me at all.,2,1
I woke up with a very sore throat and painful sinus.  I checked the a/c unit which was filled with grime and dust.  I was spending the day at auditions with my son - I felt awful the entire day.  Someone needs to check this stuff!!!,2,1
"Ridiculous. I booked a room and canceled it almost immediately using Booking.com and the charged me for the full price if the room. I even asked if I could just have a credit for a future stay and according to Booking.com, ""the upper management declined."" Completely unreasonable. I'm out about $200 for a room I never stayed in.",1,1
"I prepaid for three nights but was unable to arrive timely due to hurricane, flash flood, and severe thunderstorm warnings in the area.  Despite the manager being totally lovely and understanding, corporate refused to refund the first night.",1,1
"Issues at check in, and getting card holds refunded. Front of house staff and manager aloof, admitted they are doing differently to their hotel policies, but didn’t seem remotely bothered   No effort at all to help resolve the issue. Plenty of other good hotels in NYC that are easy to stay at",1,1
Upon arrival I requested a room on a higher floor and was told the hotel was sold out which was a lie.Upon entering the room I immediately noticed some small stains and hair on the sheets.  My husband called to inform the front desk and we were quickly moved to a different room which was tiny my husband and myself couldn’t fit in the bathroom together as we needed to get ready for our dinner. we requested a different room because the new room was just to small. The third room was better but the bathroom outlet didn’t work so I had to do my hair in the bedroom. We stay in the city almost every weekend and expect to enjoy our room and hotel amenities. this was a disappointing experience and we will definitely not return for a stay. The manager was also rude he came upstairs to,2,1
AWFUL experience. The beds are extremely small and uncomfortable. The room is so gross. Lampshade has a stain all over it. My sheets had a stain. The wood in the bathroom was molded and chipping. By far worst experience.,1,1
"Booked a King bed deluxe room with my partner, we were given 2 separate beds, we were not told about it - with a 10h flight and arrival at midnight it was a very bad surprise. We were promised the room we booked next day and told to pack and store our bags until the room was ready, when we were back to check in to our new room we were told it was not available and that we had to go back to our old room. Terrible experience, over rated over priced terrible hotel. Fortunately we were able to find a much better replacement nearby.",1,1
"Great reception area that’s it , room are stylishly decorated to within an inch of their life but entirely dysfunctional , street noise is continuous service is slow , renovated recently on a low budget, cheap and a bit nasty",2,1
"Would give a zero if I could, the lobby and position of the hotel is lovely.... and misleading the reception area was filled with guests complaining, the expensive rooms were tiny, dark and unclean even toilets had not been flushed, hair-clips on window sills, carpets old worn and grotty not at all like the pictures on the website.   Its noisy (not the usual noise from New York City Streets or even other guests) but the  humongous cluster of ancient AC units outside the windows that were so earsplittingly loud they sounded like aircraft engines and literally shook the rooms.   The hotel is very aware of the problem which looking on this site it was reported in 2017. It is now 2019.   They thoughtfully use the tiny rooms and noise problems to scam unfortunate guests into paying",1,1
I arrived at the hotel at 630 pm.  My room was NOT READY.  No offer of a drink at the bar while I waited almost 45 mins for the room to be available.   Bathroom needs a complete redo.  Don't work out in the fitness center.  The smell of mold is OVERWHELMING and the treadmill shuts off repeatedly during attempt at a workout.  Turn the heat down.,2,1

If you want a room where you sleep next to the equivalent of a jumbo jet's motor then this is the place for you. The room was right next to the hotel's engine room.  I complained and they told me to go to the shop next door and buy some ear plugs!!!!!!!!!  The roof top is good though.  They advertise a pool but check that it has water in it at the time you have booked for. Wasn't in use when I was there even though it was hot. All the staff that rely on tips are absolutely delightful.  The others are fair to woeful.  My new room's air-conditioning was hot in the night and freezing during the day.

"Staying at The Empire Hotel was so noisy, it felt like you were sleeping on the street, we did ask to move to a quieter part of the hotel but the staff weren't very helpful or accommodating at all even though the housekeeping told us other rooms were available in the quieter part of the hotel. The bathroom was unclean with mould on the shower screen and bath, there were toiletries for only 1 person even though there were 3 people in the room. the curtains were badly stained as was the bedsheet and my daughter was bitten after sleeping in one of the beds. I also noticed they over charged us as we have a food bill for the lounge which we never ordered, so overall very poor. Lastly we had problems as we couldn't get wifi in our room, we wasted a lot of our time having to wait in",1,1
"Perfect location, nice lobby, easy check in. However, room too hot, room looked into air shaft above center air conditioning machinery. Constant loud din. Blanket too heavy and hot with nothing in between. For the price, even in NYC, a beautiful lobby doesn’t make up for those conditions in the room.",2,1
Check-in was poor. Staff left me standing for 5 mins while she went somewhere with no explanation and no apology when she returned. Rooms do not have coffee makers and there is no coffee in the lounge. Rooms do not have functioning thermostats. Location is great for Lincoln Center but that's about the hotel's only virtue.,2,1
Stayed on the first floor with inward facing room. The noise from the industrial ventilation system which was outside our windows was completely unacceptable. Exit to roof top bar needs a bit of a refresh. Staff were very friendly.,2,1
"On a positive note the hotel is in a great location in front of the Metropolitan Opera. The room is in serious need of updates and the carper was dirty. The heating/cooling unit was very outdated, had buttons which did not function. In my last night the cooling unit stopped working, began to heat in a dangerous way and the temperature in the room rose to 85 degrees. The technician fixed it but he did not clean the filter that was completely dirty and could be the cause of overheating.",2,1
"This pricey hotel has a cool lobby bar and rooftop bar but otherwise, skip it. Tiny bathrooms, small rooms, dark, claustrophobic hallways with strange wallpaper that makes you feel uneasy. Staff doesn't seem to know what is going on when you ask questions. No coffee machine in rooms and no free coffee anywhere in hotel and no room service....big mistake.",2,1
"Four star but should be three stars. It took us 3 attempts to get a decent room. The first room was the size of half a shoe box with a night stand that kept toppling over. Room 2 was bigger but was like being in the bowels of a ship with a horrendous noise from a kitchen extractor fan and sewage coming out of the bath tap. Room 3 was passable, that's the best I can say. The internet is NON existent in the rooms. The roof terrace is nice but you get told repeatedly that ALL the tables are reserved. The only good thing about this place is it's proximity to the Lincoln Center and Central Park.",1,1
Very good service. Hotel is in desperate need of renovation. Location is excellent. Staff is very good. The condition of the hotel is deteriorating. They no longer have coffee pots in the rooms which is totally unacceptable.,1,1

Very dark, one lamp in the room, 75o and could not adjust temp.  Bathroom very tired and really no amenities.  Staff was great.   Fairly expensive for one night.",2,1
"Poorest quality renovation both in terms of decoration and amenities! Tinny rooms, poorly decorated with no taste or intention. Room light switch hard to access; door could not be open as it hit the closet which displayed deep scratches in its poor quality. (forget wood!). Actually the doors of the closet could not fit to close completely.",2,1
Poorly maintained hotel with poor amenities. Wardrobe and carpet were in very bad shape. Room lighting was bad. Location good. Bell staff good. Rest of the hotel was horrible. Skip it. Not worth the money paid.,1,1
The overall experience was not a good one. The Hotel is very dark and the rooms are not maintained to any reasonable standard.The pictiures on their website makes it quite misleading. Staff are well rehearsed in their manner and do not make quests feel they are happy to stay at this Hotel. I was highly disapointed with the overall experience and would certainly not  be a returning guest. I would not recomend this hotel.,1,1

"The first room was spacious, bath in the bathroom, Room 822. No bed!!! Are you kidding me, a pull out sofa bed, is this a hotel or a hostel. Second room offered has a bed, very small but that's okay, downside is that could here the aircon outside, constantly. Too late to bother a third attempt but don't ever accept 101 either if you prefer less noise.   Lobby showed great promise but let down by the rooms.  I have yet to find a decent hotel in New York!",1,1

When i attempted to redeem, managers had changed and the new manager didnt get back to me(after her initial response). I wrote a review concerning this response and was contacted again. They wouldnt honor the free night (despite having the correspondance agreed to refund me a portion of my original reservation), but agreed to refund me part of my initial room ( a percentage) and to reach out for an exclusive deal/upgrade on a future visit (in exchange for removing the 2nd review) I reached out last week (in our email chain) and was quoted a price that was at least $40 per night higher than the published rates (never mind what they would be direct",2,1

The beds are uncomfortable, the wallpaper is peeling off the walls, the bathroom frosted door was drawn on and covered in mold not to mention the handle broken and toilet runs constantly. The a/c rattled and was covered in water and mold, the coffee make didnt work, the carpet was shredding and had crazy sticky stuff on it that stuck to your feet like gum. The internet also when in and out and was as fast as old skool dial up.   I know the hotel is old and that is fine but for over $400 a night, the rooms",1,1
The hotel is beautiful but the front desk is awful and there is always hidden fees to your room.When I spoke to the manager she was so rude.  I recommend to go anywhere else because in NYC there is so many beautiful hotels.,2,1
"This was not a 4 star hotel. It was shabby and dated, did not feel clean. No coffee/ tea maker. No bathrobes. Pool was not open. Safe did not work. Location was good. Rooftop bar is nice with good view.",1,1
Checkin is 3...had to wait past 4 for room. Tv remote didnt work. AC didnt work & Mgr. Didnt believe me even though maintenance was there twice. Called for ice daily front desk transferred me to housekeeping everytime and no one answers. Had to keep telling FD no one answered. Waited 45 mins for ice. No kid food on rooftop menu except tatortots. Need reg pizza or mac and cheese or something added. Safe in room broke. Interior of rooms falling apart. Paint drywall coming off. Mold in bathrooms. We have been coming 12 yrs. No more,1,1
"Such a shame, we started our 14 night stay in what turned out to be the worst hotel of our stay. The room and bathroom were very tired and in desperate need of refurbishment. The air conditioning was exceptionally noisy and ineffective ! We didn’t sleep well, we also asked at Reception to move room, they offered to send an engineer but it remained broken for our 3 night stay.  Location is good and subway is close by, staff are friendly enough but don’t go out their way to help.  The roof terrace (once you’ve climbed the ugly stairway to reach it) is nice. The pool area is a disappointment ! Tiny, covered over and poorly staffed. We spent less than an hour here with our 9yr old before it was shut because of rain ! It is a covered pool so this seemed a little excessive, the guy",2,1
"I booked a 15 night,  prepaid stay with them via Hotels.com a few months ago for this coming October.  Since then, I ended up renting an apt in NYC for 2 yrs... and no longer need the hotel in October.... Yet they are refusing to let me cancel and refund me the money... despite October being a high demand month for NYC hotels... and it being super close to the New Yorker Festival....  To keep my $5600 is outrageous when they can easily free up the room for another to purchase.   Most NYC hotels I've used have been cooperative and flexible.  I handed found this hotel's management to be inflexible and at arms length.... not what one wants in hotel service.",1,1
We moved out after 1 night of a planned 3 night stay as we couldn’t stand the damp and mould in the bedrooms. It looks like lots of money has been spent on the lobby and superficial decorating in the rooms but providing healthy air to breathe should be a priority!,1,1
"Needs major upgrade. Scaffolding around the building but no work being done. Rooms dark, wallpaper peeling, WiFi spotty and weird spots on the walls in the bathroom. The sink seemed to be falling off the wall. The window faces another building a few feet away. The only good thing is great location at Lincoln Center.",1,1
"The rooms were small, and it didn't feel clean since most of the interior were rusty and old. We both got sick after having the breakfast buffet also, not very lucky having a plane to Europe straight after 😞The only part that made the stay more enjoyable was the staff, and especially Chris at the front desk! The hotel is very lucky to have him working there!!",2,1
No service. Bell service are not helpful. Unclean moldy room with old used soap stuck to sink. Small room can’t get luggage around beds . No luggage racks no hangers in closet. Front desk unpleasant no knowledge on NYC.,1,1
"Great location. Rooms small and very dark . No natural light. You could not see what the weather was like. Due to the design of the building. The room was noisy due to air con pipes going past windows. Take ear plugs. We had 5 rooms 3 had to argue for new rooms and managed to after a lot of stress.they were told but this is New York as if that’s a reason for small/dark rooms.  Small bathrooms . Bill way out , had to argue again. Told to go back to booking site! Great roof top bar, but at $9 a bottle of beer , didn’t spend much time there.",2,1
"Not coming back ! Rooms are old , room cleaning did not come , bathrooms is tiny , street window 2nd floor very noisy, windows dirty , AC from the 80’s . Lobby nice , Consierge nice , Wallpaper in Floor irritating ... aso...",2,1
"The room wasn't well equiped at all. No tea or Coffee, no kettle. No hairdryer.  Outside air conditioning was very loud. Basically we couldn't have a good sleep for 4 nights and we paid enough and had to pay at least $50 just on Coffee from Starbucks.",2,1
"Was an ok hotel at best, like most in NYC, small rooms, however we'd booked superior rooms, there was nothing superior about them, unless you class a tiny bathroom and a full sized sliding window coming off in your hands. Nice bar on the roof, what I return, probably not!",2,1
"Overcharged my credit card, customer service was terrible! Was not contacted by management- no surprise! Fridge didnt work, staff was not friendly at all! Overall they get 0 score from me and my family!",1,1
"I am so sad and embarrassed at the hotel experience that I just had. I have spent the past two days apologizing over and over again to my out of town guest that I convinced to stay in this hotel over others. The rooftop and pool deck experience were nice, and that's all I had known in the past. I assumed that the hotel experience would mirror this.   It is quite possible the worst hotel stay I have ever had. We checked in to very rude staff who made it clear we were burdening them by taking questions. We had spent a lot of time in advance reserving the perfect suite - and when we walked in it smelled so terrible of chlorine that we couldn't sit in there for more than 10 minutes without a chemical headache. The front desk told us there was only one other suite in the entire hotel",1,1
"This is a run down, tired and dirty hotel whose only redeeming feature is it is in New York. There the attraction ends. Mould-covered air conditioning units you can’t control; a seventh floor bedroom window that doesn’t shut; a room no self-respecting cat would want to be swung in; a toilet that, bizarrely, wasn’t fixed to the floor; and filthy carpets. It would be a mystery to us if this place received a two star rating. We moved after one night to the excellent Grand Hyatt on East 42nd street, with little price difference. To The Empire Hotel’s credit, they agreed to refund the two nights we didn’t stay there.",1,1
"I had 0 min sleep the first night! so much noise, those people next door slammed the door loudly  in and out their room since middle night, talked loudly in the hall way, other people couldn’t stand and yelled out: shut up!, the noise continued at 1am,  front desk was called at 3am for security to come, same noise happened at 5am, absolutely 0 sleep for me. Complained to front desk, they offered $75 compensation!! It is not acceptable!!  I don’t what to expect for my 2nd night...",1,1
"We came for 1 night on 8/6 to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary. We’re locals and wanted a night out in the city. We really wanted to love this place but just couldn’t.   More than 1/2 the rooftop bar was closed and they wouldn’t open it up for us or others that asked despite the fact that there was no event going on at 11pm on a Tuesday night and we were hotel guests.The few seats that they had were taken by couples or sleeping children there with their parents. So we left. This was a HUGE disappointment given that the rooftop bar was a big reason we booked here.  I called down for extra pillows when we checked in at 4:30, but by 10:30pm nothing had been delivered to our room. We went to the front desk and were assured we would receive 2 feather pillows, however instead we",1,1
"Unfortunately the negative elements of my stay at the Empire outweighed the positive. For that reason, I won’t be returning and wouldn’t recommend this hotel.  The location is great, just off Broadway and close to Central Park and the Lincoln Centre. The hotel staff were very courteous and the check-in experience fairly efficient. The rooftop bar is a really cool place to hang out, good food and drinks, great views, not cheap but as you would expect for Manhattan. That is where the positives end.  The rooms are small, old and tired. In fairness the bed was comfortable enough however the aircon so noisy I had to switch it off to sleep and the (free) broadband dropped out so frequently it was impossible to work. I am so pleased I had booked a Superior King Room because anything",2,1
"Lobby is lovely that's the biggest positive. States its a 4 star actually would rate as a 2/3 star. Dated surroundings. Room very small and bathroom even smaller. Paper peeling off walls, paint work dirty. There was a power outage whilst we were there very few emergency lights worked the management resorted to putting glow sticks in stairwells. For a Health & Safety conscious country the hotel didnt appear to have an emergency plan. Pool is more of a plunge pool full of children. Bar don't serve coffee only alcoholic drinks. Would not stay here again.",2,1
"Good location, nice bed, that’s about it. Old, small room , not in a good shape, A/C unit was noisy, not a great value. There are better options for the price out there. I’m not going back there again.",2,1
The front desk staff were rude and very unhelpful. The television in our room did not work due to a poor internet connection and there was mold in the shower. Housekeeping was extremely slow to makeup the room daily.,1,1
"Do not stay in a ""41"" room.  They are tiny and dark, as the curtains can not be opened due to being an interior room.  These rooms should only be used for storage, and not of humans.  Upon check-out, no one inquired about my stay.  I clearly know why.  When you can't fit your knees in the bathroom, it may be too small.",2,1
"There was no complementary coffee or water the fridge wasn't working the towels weren't enough the room and bathroom was not completely clean, Bathroom services are not enough such as shampoo, soap and paper towels.",1,1
"I have never had such a bad experience in a hotel in NYC before. The hotel is old, dirty, dark and understaffed. The standard rooms are awful, more like a closet with noisy air conditioning which works sometimes. I had a hard time to get the phone answered by the front desk and when my ac didn't work their solution was to send someone to fix it three times and I ended up sleeping without it in the heat of the NYC summer!!! and do not think that they would even give you a tiny water bottle for free every day, because they charge you for it at the end of your stay.  Very poor hotel indeed.",1,1
"Birthday celebration trip to New York were marred by poor service, noisy air con, tired hotel which claims to be 4 star but isn’t. It’s a great location but overpriced for what it has to offer.  Bathroom shower was poor & dilapidated, hot water was variable- breakfast at $25 was poor and much better available outside of the hotel.",1,1
No control for air con so either hot or cold.  No advice on what charges were taken at check in.  No ventilation in bathroom making whole room hot.  No stocked mini bar or glass shower screen as stated in booking.  No shampoo had to wash hair with shower gel.  No natural light blinds always pulled and view of building right next door.  Very dim lighting.  INCREDIBLY noisy in hallway ie other guests. Can hear people in rooms 3 doors down yelling and slamming doors.  Called front desk three times (via housekeeping as they never answer).  Security didn’t do much. When complained was told by incredibly rude older man at Reception I just have to keep calling all night till they stop.  Worst 4 star hotel I’ve ever stayed in.   Only good thing was comfy pillows. And manager Marilyn who,1,1
Got 2 rooms for 2 nights one of the room the ac was not working properly. The other room he door doesnt close right you have to slam hard to close and pull hard to open. Complained & argued before they gave me another room.,1,1
"I stayed at this hotel for a conference and initially was quite pleased with the rooftop bar. There definitely were some drawbacks: the ""pool"" is more like a narrow wading track, my room was tiny (and the hall smelled like ganga the first night), and my bed was very hard with lumpy pillows, but for the price and location I thought I had gotten what my company had paid for. The real problem came at checkout. I was confronted with a bill for $91 for ""residency fees"" of over $22 a night. I had not been informed of this fee when I checked in. I was told, very rudely, that I had signed something to this effect but when I looked at what I signed, it essentially seemed like I was signing for incidentals, which I was careful not to rack up while I was there, and the ""fee"" was completely",1,1
"After attitude my colleague and I were accommodated again with attitude and it was not busy (no surprise). The room door opened and I we were smacked with stench, only to find a floating turd in the toilet. Cleanliness is a big deal and this was unreal. I truly still can't believe it. The staff googling about it was more disgusting than the poop. Staying here was my suggestion, we were tired from work and a long flight and had to gather our things, find and stay at another hotel. How embarrassing. To think we we're going to return in August. Never even got to see thrre rooftop. What a fail.",1,1
Place looks good until you get to your room which is dirty with really dirty bathrooms and fridges and old fashioned tv. Really needs a good overhaul. Was originally staying at the Hilton but changed to the Empire because it was the Gossip Girl Hotel. Big Mistake!!! Expected so much more,1,1
"We were so excited to be staying at this hotel being Gossip girl fans ! However the staff were not pleasant, friendly or well mannered . We went up to the rooftop to have dinner and enjoy the view but were only allowed to sit In one area, as the rest of the bar area was reserved (it was 10:30pm and not a busy night) We walked to the enclosed area to sit and finish our drinks, but were told by Karen that the area was closing . Not more than a minute later a man and women walked in and sat down and were not told to leave!!! As paying guests and visitors to your hotel, we expected more . To top it off , on checking out we waited at the front desk to hand our keys in and the two women would not even acknowledge us . This was a very disappointing experience and we will tell our",1,1
"Terrible Hotel. They can't borrow you scissors. That is their policy. You can walk into hotel with gun, but the won't borrow you scissors, because you can hurt someone.   When asking the manager for help, he turns away and starts to walk away from you to elevator. In the middle of your sentence. Very rude language and behavior.  I was charged for minibar use which was false. When i pointed out that mistake and wrote a ticket to resolve the issue, nothing happened. Still didn't get any response after 3 e-mails and two weeks of time.",1,1
"The only thing good about this hotel is the location.  The staff here are rude, unhelpful and patronizing.  We had dinner one night on the rooftop restaurant and no one greeted us, no one bothered to say hello, welcome. Nothing.  It seems that you have to ""be someone"" or look a certain way otherwise they pay you no attention. I also asked for our air conditioning to be turned down (there are no controls to do it yourself) and this was never done, needless to say we all ended up with the flu. Worst hotel experience of my life and I travel a fair amount.",1,1
Very disappointed.... Unless you have plenty of money don't bother going... No coffee tea in rooms and didn't even get complimentary bottles of water... Couldn't use the top deck or pool (was it even  a pool) as there were parties up there and closed off to the public...,2,1
"I stayed 2 nights in this hotel because my graduation was across the street at the Lincoln Center. First, kudos to the staff, the doormen and front desk staff are super nice and quick to help.   My only complaint is the actual facilities, having paid just under 1k for 2 nights I feel my room was too dirty and deteriorated. My bathroom door looked like it had exploded and someone spackled it back together, however, my biggest complaint is about the MANY white crusty stains throughout the room, especially above BOTH beds, the pics are one of each of the two beds; if you use a black light I'm sure the room would light up like a Christmas tree, gross! Please, if you're going to have fabric headboards and/or texturized wallpaper, implement appropriate cleaning routines.",2,1
"Hotel rooms in need of an upgrade. Some rooms are so small you barely have room for a suitcase. Closets are not full length so if you have a gown to hang, forget it. AC didn’t work in two different rooms.",1,1
"Upon arrival we had to pay a $150 deposit that wasn't initially stated anywhere before arrival. No confirmation email from hotel to confirm details and let us know this information. We got the keys for the room and we paid for a Junior king suite, the keys didn't work twice and twice we had to go up and downstairs to get fresh keys with finally the third working. The receptionist said it can be altered by phone and electronics but neither of ours did as I didn't have mine on me whatsoever. We get into the room and find ourselves disappointed to be on the third floor with no real ""stunning city views"" which Is what we paid the money for in the first place in buying a Junior King Suite instead of a normal Double room.  We looked around for an information welcome book which we had",1,1
"The Empire Hotel was enjoyable except for the fact that there was way to receive coffee in the room.  No coffee maker, no room service, nothing but ""leave the hotel and go to Starbucks"" is what we were told.  We will never stay there again...",1,1
"The whole experience was terrible.  So I booked this because I’m a gossip girl fan and all I have to say is chuck bass is a liar lol. Hotel made us wait hours for the room to be ready, they were unapologetic about it.  Got to the room with a view of a brick wall and it was filthy dirty.  Bad smell and we wouldn’t dare shower.  Overall just a huge disappointment.  Booked for 2 nights and checked out after the first night, wouldn’t stay there again if it was free.  One positive is the location is fantastic.",1,1
Easy to find thanks to it's roof top sign and check in was smooth. Was allocated room 1101 on the 11th floor and although very small looked good.  A/C was on when I arrived and it was  super loud. After a bit of fiddling around with the controls I managed to turn it off but I could still hear A/C noise. I presumed it was coming from an neighboring room and would stop in due course but it wasn't and it NEVER stopped. Turns out my room and all rooms on the courtyard side of the hotel are directly above the hotel's main A/C fans which run 24/7 (see photos) and at night the sound is broadly the same as being on an aircraft. Bring good quality earplugs if you want to sleep!,2,1
"After reviewing the Empire Hotel for a long -anticipated pleasure trip in New York, upon check-in we could see that building itself was old. Still, the lobby looks comfortable though dated.  The room I had reserved for the two of us was not at all like the same type pictured on the hotel site. It was dark, small, had no dressers and a bathroom no bigger than a telephone booth. What made matters worse, we soon saw that the room was not fully cleaned, with debris still on the old carpeting and the decorative bed pillows stained.  After we found no coffee maker in the room, we inquired at the desk if we might have one and we’re told that most rooms in this highly-rated (and expensive) hotel no longer had free coffee or tea available—even though it’s depicted in their site. The",1,1
"The “courtyard view” was a collection of air conditioner compressors and pipes.  And the rooms across the courtyard were too close to assure privacy.  Therefore, opening curtains was not an option. The room was dark with insufficient lighting. It felt like a dungeon. The “closet” was a bar over a safe with a curtain, the towel had a big hole in it, the frig didn’t work, the sink had no drain plug, the bathroom moulding was disgusting, and the water dispenser in the gym was out of order. The decor in the room and corridors was dark, dingy and very outdated. It was a very unpleasant experience and I would never stay there again.",1,1
"They tried to close us out a day early for no reason - Which took time out of our  day to clear up and make confusing costs on my card because they charged it before it was time and had to reverse/redo charges. Room did not have bathrobes or water  like it was advertised. No ice machine available to guests. No room service which we were looking forward to. Rooms overall were not as nice as the picture. You can hear EVERY door slam in the hallway at all hours of the night. The waiter at the lobby bar asked me to put my feet down (off an ottoman) while having a cocktail one night.    That being said, I did like the location, it was very easy to get most places. The bell hop and entry way greeters were very nice. The blonde female at the front desk was very helpful (in clearing up",2,1
Great looking hotel! Beautifully decorated.  •HORRIBLE mattresses - rick hard & paper thin pillows •One of 3 adults and a child to our room couldn’t make it. We were forced to pay anyway.  •Breakfast was a total rip off.,2,1
"I am disappointed in several things.   1. I initially had booked for 3 adults and 1 child, and paid the $40 fee for the additional adult (which was absurd in the first place). That adult canceled, and the hotel refused to refund me the $40, even when Expedia contacted them on my behalf, as well as at the check-in desk. This single night cost me over $400. They couldn't refund $40 for a non-present guest?  2. The bathroom door in our room (1134) looks like it's been kicked in before, and the 'patch jobs' all over the bathroom look terrible. For over $400 for the night, I expected better.   3. The food at the overpriced and under-serviced breakfast was awful. The bacon was burned, the sausage tasted like wet cardboard, the french toast tasted like a dry sponge. There were no",2,1
There was no internet on the day of my arrival and the rooms need a serious upgrade. Not worth the money. Efforts of management to help were unsatisfactory. The hotel is far from what it was years ago.,1,1
"The room was teeny. I mean, so small that we couldn’t have a suitcase open and walk by it at the same time. There was no closet and only two small hooks for clothes which held 4 hangers. When I complained,  the front desk sent up an enormous clothing rack which was too large to fit in the room! The bathroom was passable, but just barely. The Toilet ran constantly unless you adjusted the handle; there was no plug in the drain in the sink, so you were screwed if you dropped something in the sink. The safe was located on the floor which was really awkward to access. All in all, the hotel needs a makeover. The lobby was lovely, and the staff was polite. So that’s saying something in New York. Additionally, the location can’t be beat. Luckily we only stayed for 3 nights. Any longer",2,1
Just spent 8 nights in NYC. Checked into the Empire Hotel for its location and to be close to a Conference I was attending.   We booked a Queen room for our stay. When we got to the room we found there wasn’t enough room around the bed to even open a large suitcase. We decided to upgrade to a larger room so we actually had some extra space to move. Cost an extra US$60 plus tax per night.   Upgraded Room was on the 2nd floor. It had no mini bar (not an issue for us) but also didn’t have coffee making facilities. Rang down to reception to ask for a coffee machine to be told that they don’t supply coffee making in the rooms below the 3rd floor. It was ‘hotel policy’.  Effectively a room that ended up being nearly AUD $450/night didn’t come with a kettle!   Door and household staff,2,1
"The staff are welcoming, the lobby bar is lovely, but the rooms need renovation. The paint was peeling off the bathroom door, the toilet hadn’t been cleaned, the shower pressure was a drip and when I came back to the room at the end of the day, housekeeping hadn’t even taken away the dirty coffee cups. I’ve stayed at this hotel before and don’t remember it being this bad. I won’t stay here again.",2,1
"There is no way this is a 4-star hotel, probably not even a 3-star.  While the lobby is encouraging, your heart will sink when you see the state of your guest room.  Dirty, dingy, smelly - and the bathroom is HORRIBLE.  So small the trash can is shoved inside a cupboard.  The door and cupboard are warped from humidity - chipping paint all around.  Rusty and leaking bathroom fixtures.  Toilet seat was melted (I don't even want to know why), and toilet bowl scratched up.  Toilet paper = sandpaper.  WiFi dropped continually.  Was dinged with an additional bill for mini bar after the fact although it was NOT used and this was established and agreed at checkout.  Not only was the mini bar not used, we couldn't even get our free tea and water replenished after multiple repeated",1,1
"the stay was okay, the room was small and damp. My main problem was after the stay I got a notification that they had charged us double. My family didn't find out until we got to the airport on the way home. So i called to ask to get my money back. they asked me to send back statements which I did then they proceeded to tell me I was lying and refused to give me my money back. After weeks of punishing calls and emails, they finally sent me an amount of the full total of money which was even the full amount. I still haven't got the full amount. If you're looking for a great hotel to stay at this is not the one.",1,1
"This hotel is in a great location but it's generally a grody place.  Rooms smell of mildew and are small.  There is not a sense of ampleness i.e. we had to ask for more shampoo, etc.  Friendly staff and nice roof restaurant but it is for the young, at least on weekends with pulsing music and lots of noise.  Hard to talk.",2,1
"Our room was very small very damp, not well ventilated. When we ask to change room, they said it would be extra cost. internet was not working in the room. We couldnt even reach the front desk about the internet issue. The pool was not open at the time they said it would be open. So overall it was poor service but great location!",2,1
"Very disappointed with the hotel.  I thought I was booking a luxury hotel especially for the price of $500 per night.  When we got into our room, I was shocked by the small size particularly when the room was advertised as a superior.  Our view consisted of looking to a brick wall, and our AC didn’t work.  To make matters worse, I booked the room in August 2018 and on the day of arrival it was advertised for $307.  Because of the disappoint in our dumpy $500 a night room, I asked for the advertised rate.  Still waiting to see if they will honor it and give me a credit.  I would recommend.  Lots of other hotels in NYC where you can get much better for your money.  One more thing, we arrived at 11:30 and check in wasn’t until 3:00.  However the front desk informed us that they put",1,1
"When you assigned to floors 1-3, even though you pay almost $700 for 2 nights, you can’t get a morning coffee in your room. No room service/coffee pots. However, the 4th thru 11th have Keurigs. How do I know this I requested to be on same floor as my daughter and her family and the other in-laws and were told we were on same floor. Actually they were all on 11th. They had coffee pots.",1,1
"Me and a friends stayed in the hotel for 2 days. I recommend the location as it's convenient to travel within Manhattan and quite at nights. We also visited the rooftop twice, once for a brunch and once for drinks. And I can say that the best part of the hotel is definitely the rooftop.  The room they gave to us was barely adequate for two with a very small bathroom. They didn't even bother for putting a bath towel there:) The bed was comfortable and whatsoever but will not stay again and don't recommend.",2,1
Let’s start this trip off with having the customer service employee view my LinkedIn profile prior to me checking in. Very creepy! Next- the gym wallpaper is terrible! Makes you dizzy while running on the treadmill! Staff not friendly! No toilet paper in the lobby bathroom! This wasn’t a good situation! Overpriced drinks! Overpriced rooms! Valet staff were lazy and tried to get me to self park! Room was okay. Hope you like sleeping in a closet sized room! Housekeeping entered my room 3 times the morning I was to check out. Nice to wake up to your hotel room door being barged through! Never again will I stay at here!,1,1
"Small, dirty and noisy rooms, leaky faucets, overprice...am I forgetting anything? Oh yea, too bad because its a great midtown location especially for Lincoln Center and Met events. They should be ashamed to offer rooms in a hotel that is 100 years past its useful prime! How do they sleep at night! DUMP!",1,1
"The check in time is 3 pm but we didn't get our room until 10 pm!  The guy at the desk had to go upstairs and physically check to see if the room was ready because ""housekkeeping is difficult to get ahold of and it's not our fault"".  Once we got the room, the handheld shower was broken!  Water everywhere!  They couldn't send an ""engineer"" until the next day.  The same ""engineer"" had to come upstairs to bring us batteries for the remote.  ""I don't need an engineer.  Just batteries please"".  They tried to compensate by giving us free breakfast.  Although the rooftop restaurant had stunning views, the free breakfast left much to desire.  The double bed is actually a full size bed.  Not queen..",1,1
"Tiny rooms, no big deal, it's NYC.  Horrifically overpriced drinks, no big deal, it's NYC.  No iron in the room, Maybe that's nyc? What sets this place apart from everyone else in a bad way is their service. The people who work here are rude, unhappy, and have no desire to help you.    A small example of my long list of issues: the in-room Keurig is nice, but we were given one decaf and one tea k-Kup. We asked the front desk seven times over three days, and they never brought us regular coffee.  Never.  They'd forward the front desk call to housekeeping who would not answer, send to other departments, who would not answer. It was increasingly frustrating.    Shall I talk about our broken toilet? Dirty towels? Okay, rant over",1,1
"The Empire need to stop living on location and old merits!  It's time for an upgrade/renovation - the hotel is very worn down.  The time has changed, there are more traffic, both of quests and outside the window.   We had a suite, in which the sofa bed was totally worn out, with a deep sag in the middle and the top bed mattress was stained with bodily fluids... Not so fresh.   The AC made such a loud noise that it was impossible to sleep when it was on.   The windows are old and draughty and not sound proof at all.   Offering purchasing of wine and champagne, but only having paper mugs to drink from is not that fancy... why is there no glasses?   The wardrobe is useless. There is a shelf in the middle on which the safe box is. This means not enough hight for a standard gent's",2,1

There’s no room service, the bedding is uncomfortable along with the pillows, the bathrooms are small and the grout work looks like a blind person put in the tile. The TV in the room was old and the remote barely worked and the WiFi was terrible and kept going in and out. When I left the hotel no one even asked me how my stay was. I called for a bell man when we were leaving, we waited so long that I went down stairs to check out and left my friends in the room waiting with the bags.

"The heat didn't work, so the room was quite cold.  I wanted to call the front desk, but the phone in the room didn't work.  So I had to go down to the front desk, even though it was late at night and I had already gone to bed.  The front desk told me the heat wouldn't come on until the temperature dropped below 50 degrees.  That is too cold to sleep!  Eventually the manager gave me a space heater so I could sleep.",1,1
"I stayed at the Empire Hotel last week.  A few days after I checked out an unauthorized charge appeared on my credit card.  The charge was not on the invoice I received when I checked out.  We didn’t take anything from the room.  So there shouldn’t be any extra charge.  I called the hotel.  Nobody there seemed able to tell me what the charge was about.  I was transferred around and mostly nobody answered.  I had to call again.  After six calls over two days I was finally told that I had to send emails to their accounting department and the customer service department.  And emails are the only way to contact these department since they don’t have phone numbers.  So I sent the emails, twice.  I received no reply whatsoever.  I am start to thing disputing through the credit card",1,1
It is embarrassing that a name as the Empire Hotel feels like a 2 / 3 star hotel. You should revisit pricing and upgrade structure. This has been the worst price quality match I have ever received. I strongly suggest not to use this structure,2,1
"If you are staying here for a night or so. You can get through. For a longer stay where you have a lot of luggage and items for the bathroom, there’s very little storage. Suitcases are all over the floor with a tiny closest set quite high. And it is not that cheap. Maybe stay at the YMCA if money is a concern or at Trump Tower if money isnt and you are planning to go to Lincoln Center.",1,1
There is nothing to recommend it other than its location being close to Lincoln Center and the activities that happen there.  It is also close to Julliard School.  There is really nothing else to recommend it other than it is close to Lincoln Center,2,1
"I do not recommend this hotel,  It is very difficult to sleep, very noisy, bad carpet smell, very cold. I tried to change rooms but they were mostly the same. I was very tired after the three nights I spent here.",2,1
"I have never been in such a bad room so far! Everything was destroyed and did not look at all as on the Pictures. The Location is great, just a few minutes walk from the Central Park. Prize could be less for that what you get in this hotel.",2,1
"No blow dryer, room was too small, too warm in room. No tissues. Rust on make up mirror was gross. Service was horrible. Took an hour and four phone calls to get ice.  I would not recommend this hotel.",2,1
"I am extremely disappointed in the condition of our room. The window treatments were stained. Some of the furniture was peeling and also stained. The lighting in the room was terrible. Lamp shades were stained. The bathroom was dingy with only one light. The shower curtain smelled. The mattress was very hard. Everything was very old, worn and tired looking. Considering the location so close to Lincoln Center, I’m shocked at the condition of our room for the price that we paid. This room is a total gut job.",1,1
"Our family of six waited over 6 hours for our rooms! Front desk didnt care our daughter had brain injury and needed rest. Wouldn't even get ice when we requested it for her pain. Rooms were to be together and instead were several rooms apart making it difficult to be a ""family"" trip. Not at all what we expected from this hotel. My four children were really disappointed for their very first trip out of state.",2,1
"Booked a room for 2 adults and 3 children, no effort made to accommodate 3rd child and given a blanket and pillow to make our own bed. If they cannot accommodate a larger family they should not have accepted the booking. Rooms and windows very poorly insulated so heard road noise and people talking in corridor as though they were in our room. I’ll put up with a lot but when you pay over $400 per night I do expect to be able to get a good bight’s sleep.",2,1
"Hotel is old and tired.  Air Conditioning does not work.  Rooms are dark and small.  Bathrooms are not updated.  It’s a real pity as it’s a great location, but the hotel needs a major overhaul.  Just across from Lincoln Center.  So, should be much better.",1,1
The Empire Hotel is located in a great spot and we were excited to stay here. Your staff is very nice. Especially the doorman. (Stan and Jose) They helped us get on the subway and told us which one to take. The lady who checked us in was nice also and checked us in right away. But unfortunately there are more bad things about your hotel then good.  Our room has a moldy smell. The door in the bathroom looks broken. The wallpaper is pealing off from the wall. The side table in between the bed has 2 drawers that won’t stay closed no matter how many times we close it. (I hit my leg on the drawer when I went to the bathroom at night and it was very painful) The air conditioner does not work well so we have to open the window which makes the room noisy from the traffic. Most of all we,2,1
"The lobby was beautiful - exactly what I was envisioning. My room however, was the epitome of what you'd think of for the set of a new Netflix series on hotel murders. It was obvious the room was previously a closet or small staff space of some sort and had been ""renovated"" to a guest room. It was a total dump - smallest ever college dorm mini-fridge sitting on the floor next to the bed, a ""chronicles of narnia"" style wardrobe in the corner leaning forward as if it might fall over at any minute. Needless to say, I don't foresee myself staying here again.",2,1
"I am very disappointed in finding roaches in my room and bathroom. Especially disappointing to find roaches in your shower, a place you go into to wash yourself.  How’s one supposed to step in there? Won’t go back.",1,1
Location is great for the hotel other than this you are paying too much comparing to service provided they got busy next day so they did not clean our room till I called and asked to pick up the garbage.Roof top has open buffet for $25 dollars and when you check out the food is very poor quantity I will not go back Ask manger to check the size of the bed for me and her answer was she does not know what kind of bed is in my room never follow up with me on my concern.,2,1
One of the great locations in NYC. The hotel did focus on their lobby and roof top bar (which could also need a touch up) but the rooms need so much work. The sofa in our room was unusable. Chairs and tables unstable and bedroom closet was a cheap IKEA-ish type that is on its last leg. Wouldn’t recommend the hotel to friends.,2,1
"Amazing location just next to Lincoln Center, but room tiny even by New York Standards.  Almost no light, Impossible to read in room.  Two tiny drawers.  No closet, 3 foot wide alcove, with such a short hanging area that you cannot hang a dress or suit due to refrigerator and safe taking up half of the height of the area. No place in bathroom to set down toiletries except very thin top of toilet. This is not where I want to set my toothbrush etc. Heater and air so loud you cannot sleep with them on. Could not set heat or cold except to very high only anyway. I would not go back.",2,1
"The room had NO CLOSET. Very inconvenient for travelers. Shower heads weren't functioning, soap would dissolve into a slimy mess when wet. Pillows were flat and cheap. Charged outrageous service charges. Rude desk worker told part of it was for complimentary water if that's the case it wasn't very complimentary",1,1
"I understand hiking up prices when events are in town but the wear, tear and overall lack of attention to cleanliness do not warrant this inflated price. No room service, no food inside the hotel and no view. Mold on door frame, dirty light switch, some sort of grime on the window shade and the shower looks to have never been deep cleaned.",2,1
"Stained toilets, paint peeling from the ceiling in the shower noise from the street, hard beds, poorly maintained bathrooms, run down exterior. Room AC unit was older than i am and worked only fairly.",2,1
"Way overpriced, no room service, on site restaurant only has apps/small plates, staff not particularly friendly or helpful, variable water temp in shower (hot to cold, back to hot), no free water in rooms, on and on",1,1
Not friendly staff. Not good housekeeping service. The best thing is the location. Noisy and id you ask for something we received no answer. Did not replace toilet paper or shower cap and never came to help with bags,2,1
"Empire hotel sits right across the street from the Lincoln Center and it is my preferred place to stay when we come to see an opera. I arrived at Empire around 2:20 PM and was told I had to wait until 3 PM to check in.  When I returned to the hotel around 3:30 after a visit to the Met opera shop, the room was still not ready.  I waited in the lobby/bar area for the next 2 hours, and not a single time did a staff come to give me an update.  I only found out there was a room available upon my 4th visit to the front desk and was able to get into a room around 5:30.  I barely had enough time to prepare for a pre-opera dinner with a friend and opera at 8.  A relaxing and enjoyable experience was ruined by a stressful and not helpful check-in at Empire.",1,1
Clearly this hotel spent the budget on the lobby and rooftop restaurant and skimped on upgrades to the rooms. Staff are really nice and helpful which makes up for a lot and the bars in the lobby and rooftop are really nice but the rooms are nothing more than poor.,2,1
"While its location near Lincoln Center is ideal, this hotel makes little effort to make the guest experience tolerable. The front desk was apathetic and ignored us at check-in, The room smiled bad and was noisy, and the drinks in the lounge were poor.",1,1
The hallway smelled like urine. The furnishing and carpet in the room desperately needs to be replaced. Elevator clanked in a scary way. Bar was completely overpriced. Only saving grace was the location.,2,1
Generally the staff was nice but the hotel is getting ancient. Please update. My duvet was dirty and had holes. Crazy. I travel a lot and that was a first for me. Hope the empire does a refresh soon! Thnx,2,1
"Horrible hotel. Super old. Heating did not work in the room, it was extremely cold. When the engineer “fixed it” it was turning on and off and every time it turned on it was so loud that we thought there is a rat inside, we were waking up at night from how loins it was. Dirty room, dirty bathroom and so tiny that the sink is can only be used from the side, shower was leaking. Outlet in the bathroom was not working so I had to dry my hair seating on my knees and had hair dryer plugged behind the night stand. The hair dryer died in a few minutes I had to wait for 45 mins to have it replaced .",1,1
We came from crown plaza and stayed here to finish our holiday for 2 nights god what a horrible dark smelling hotel this is and very very small rooms and even smaller bathroom we had a long day out and someone knocked our room at 12 at night I was asleep so I didn’t answer 10 mins later the phone rang in our room 😡😡 if I wanted to answer I would of answered the door the receptionist said did you want a toothbrush no I bloody don’t I want sleep I’d say it was the worst hotel I’ve stayed in,1,1
"Waste of money, false advertising, old - looking decor, non- working facility and over - priced tiny rooms. Very disappointed, I was hoping to extend my fabulous Lincoln center experience with ""iconic' Hotel  - which became a complete disaster. Hotel needs so much work, it is so old and not properly working in every possible way. Just find something newly renovated and take uber - it will be better then wasting money here.",1,1
good location nice staff ice cold shower dated  and heat/air conditioning worked poorly everything was old  need to update hot water issue and get new ac/ heat units in the rooms. staff was nice and apologetic for long wait to check in  doorman was very nice,1,1
"For at least a decade we have used the Empire as our hotel for trips to NYC.  The location is great (next to Lincoln Center) and the hotel is clean.  Fantastic shopping and restaurants within short walking distance.  But on this visit our experience was really bad, and we will try other hotels (and I'm sure will find one) for future trips.  First, they keep raising prices, so by now the Emptire is up to $375 per night, which I find expensive for what they office.  Then, they booked us into a room next to some sort of party suite in which a very intoxicated group of revellers partied until 3am, and LOUDLY.  Through a paper-thin wall/connecting door.  Lots of boisterous shouting and singing, some sort of beer-pong game, clearly a poker kind of ambiance.  And Mariacha music, too,",2,1
"Good location of the hotel, but the room is tiny, old and noisy. With another price would be fine, but not at all for what the hotel charges. Some furniture need to be repaired. The bathroom is kind of shabby.",2,1
"Smoker in room next to us, not much they could do.  Very disappointing... very old doors and a/c unit, just felt old and dingy.  Small, small, SMALL room.  The location was great, central to many things and Central Park, roof top bar was real nice- make reservations tho.  Recommend The Smith restaurant for Breakfast.",2,1
"They destroyed a suitcase and refused to compensate  for it. We tried to speek someone responsible for it, but they just said that the employee was not present at the moment. We had to leave for the airport and had no time to solve this.",1,1
Here to attend my sisters funeral. For the price I was delighted. Not a good from check in to check out. My cubicle was small attempts made to use every space. Poor use not functions for travelers. Lobby is well done,2,1
"Beds are very small doubles (we’ve been to America a few times and never had a bed so tiny) They’re so hard that you barely get any sleep and you wake up with horrendous back pain which, coupled with the lack of sleep, made it very difficult to truly enjoy our first stay in New York! Our first room had a very noisy radiator / heating unit and thankfully we were moved but to a much smaller room with nowhere to hang your clothes and that was then filled with a tonne of chargeable items that you couldn’t move anywhere to be able to put your own amenities out! Staff in the lobby bar either can’t understand you and get your order wrong or are just rude to you. Certainly not a 4* hotel and nowhere near the ‘luxury’ promised on their website.",2,1
"Room was not ready as promised.   The front desk staff didn't care.  We were in a corner suite - 19 Line was dirty, dark and outdated. Even with the lamp that was brought in and the extra cushions for the sofa.    All the rooms need a face lift. NOW",2,1
"I stayed here on the recommendation of a family member, as it was near to the Opera. Despite the great location, the Hotel itself is dated and has horrible service. On my first stay, about a month ago, the room I was checked into was AWFUL: it had trash literally on the floor, and the heater was stuck at 80 degrees. Called the front desk 3 times with no answer, finally went downstairs and spoke to them, and they changed the room, informing me that half the hotel had their heaters stuck at 80! We were given a better room, only for the maid to ignore the Do Not Disturb sign very early in the morning-- there were a lot of unhappy patrons on our floor, and you could hear them all (thin walls?). Later, when we got home, we saw that they'd charged us for the coffee they'd left in the",1,1
"Just like any hotel we have ever stayed in this hotel had its pro's and con's unfortunately there were more pro's than con's lets start with the pro its pretty central to the city and not far from Central Park, well that covers the positive.  Now for the con's, there doesn't appear to be any bellhops at this hotel as when we arrived we had to lug the baggage in ourselves, the hotel lobby looks very grand but the piped music was Christmas music which was a bit strange as it was February when we arrived, the room we were allocated was grubby and badly in need of an update, the window overlooked the back of the hotel which I have subsequently found out means it was an interior room, the glass on the window at first appeared to be frosted then I realised it was filthy it looked like",1,1
"This hotel is ideally located near Colombus Circle and has a nice roof top with a great choice of cocktails. However, the pricey room did not meet our expectations : noisy air conditioning system, poor wifi access and dirty window. Unacceptable for the price we paid for.",2,1
This hotel is one of the worst I have ever stayed in. The staff were very unhelpful it took days to get the problems fixed. Staff on front desk just didn’t want to know at one point we were locked in the hotel room as the door wouldn’t open because of broken lock and it still wasn’t fixed when we left.,1,1
Be more attentive to your guests needs.  Rooms need to be cleaned better.  Internet access is not working.  I was charged for it even though it didn’t work.  The ITs tried to help but their help was limited,2,1
"After complaining to reception staff for security person coming all the way into room without knocking at 2am because door did not shut correctly, they laughed instead of trying to understand the issue, help out or apologize.",2,1
I was grossed out stepping on the floor it was so discusting. The hotel still uses the old motel box heating and cooling system. The system was so old and disfunctiinal that it kept me up all night with banging and rattling noise.,1,1
the location of the hotel is okay but that’s the only positive i can say about this hotel - the place is grubby and unfriendly. it is in major need of an upgrade. the walls in the rooms are paper thin and there was noise for the entire weekend. any interaction with staff wasn’t pleasant except for the maintenance guy who came to look at our shower! it has no atmosphere and i definitely would NOt recommend this hotel,1,1
"The hotel staff was nice and it looks pretty but basic things like pillows, a hairdryer, a functioning remote for the TV and a fully stocked refrigerator were all missing. The bed and the pillows (when we finally got them) were terribly uncomfortable. Not at all worth it for the price.",1,1
"The Empire used to be a great place to stay.  Our most recent stay changed our minds on that.  Check in took an hour.  When we asked for rooms (2) on a higher floor than the second floor rooms we were given we were told ""no"".  Our room did not have heat, no coffee maker, no working frig (one was present but wasn't working), and hadn't been properly cleaned (hair in the sink and shower drains, etc.).  Overall, very unpleasant.  In addition, on checkout, we were told that there is a $20/day fee for wifi and bottled water.  We didn't receive the water and the wifi is pretty bad.  In any case, we didn't have to pay this because we booked our room before this additional fee went into place.  Something to consider if you plan on staying here.  We were told that this is the new thing",1,1
"The room is small, there is only place for one suitcase. The noise of the ventilation is incessant and causes a headache. I had a lot of expectations and hopes unfortunately I was disappointed. Moreover I was charged an additional 200$ Without being notice which is outrageous.  The only positive point is the breakfast location and the geographical location of the hotel.",2,1
"Our room (841) sucked. It was miniscule and shaped like a triangle, not even a square or a rectangle. Our window was facing a brick wall. The AC was loud and obnoxious and didn't work. Every night was spent on top of the covers (even with the AC on high)! After a shower our room was stuffy and unbearable.   The bathroom was so tiny that it was impossible to fit two people into, which can be hard if you imagine one person trying to brush their teeth/ shave their face and the other trying to do their makeup (in front of the only mirror in the place!) There was no bath, only a shower (which didn't even have a door or a curtain, just half a glass). Imagine trying to shave your legs in that one ladies.  The only storage in the bathroom was on a small shelf above the toilet.",1,1
"We stayed at the Empire for a night, and although the lobby is quite stunning, the experience ended there. The room was not ready when we checked in an hour after check in time. The room wasn’t clean- nail clippings in the sink, bed sheets with a stain, just did not feel clean.",2,1
The only good thing I can say about this hotel is its location to Lincoln Center.  You literally are steps away from all that Lincoln /center and Julliard have to offer as well as a number of nice restaurants and shops.The hotel has no great facilities inside other than to drink. There are limited services at best so you are better off leaving to eat and drink elsewhere.  You will need to leave since the rooms will make you claustrophobic!   There are few amenities including glasses to drink out of and water is sold to you in the room.  Nothing worked well in the the room nor was anything pleasant either including the staff except for the doormen.,2,1
"Poorly maintained hotel that needs some money spent on it and to be managed better. I guess the first clue should be in the huge neon sign on the top of the building outside which is only half working. That sort of sums up this hotel. Only half right. Broken towel rail, broken window blinds, no light on the desk making it impossible to work there.",2,1
"Stayed for one night and that was more than enough.  Dilapidated rooms with antiquated HVAC.  My room was not refreshed and had no cups or glasses with which to make coffee from the in room keurig, and no one answered repeated phone calls even after 20 rings.  I finally gave up.  Lesson learned.",1,1
"Extremely dissatisfied with our room!  The shower was broken and we could not shower in the evening after a long day.  We had to call the front desk and they thankfully sent someone to fix it right away. But it was late and should not have been an issue at such a hotel. The style of the shower door allowed shower water into the entire bathroom and the floor was puddled.  We put towels down to be able to walk.   The heating/air unit was extremely dirty and had trash in the vent section (dirty Q-tip, wrappers, etc.). Also, all night long there was loud clanging in the wall and was very disturbing.  For such a nice hotel, there was no complimentary water in our room.  The price of a bottle was expensive at $5. This was our first time staying at the Empire Hotel. We were very",2,1

My sister and I checked in around 9pm. Upon entering our room we saw the thermostat set to 78 degrees. We each had our sons with us (8 months and 3). It was entirely too hot. I lowered the temp to 66 to try and get it to come down - waited an hour and it still was 78. Called the front desk and they said they’d send someone up. Waited an hour and no one came. At this point it’s almost midnight and we have to babies who are sweaty refusing to sleep being uncomfortable. I call again. The maintenance man comes and attempts to fix. He sets it to 60 and said to move it back up once it gets too cold. I wait another 25 minutes - it’s still 78! At this point I’m furious. I call down again and they offer me a fan. I explain this isn’t going to work. So we move rooms - to one without a,1,1

Nevertheless, the Hotel had accidentaly charged us twice for the room upon arrivel and still to this day they won’t refund us. They don’t answer calls or emails. Even our American friend who lives in New York won’t recieve a response from them. We will definitely not return.",2,1
Careful to do everything according to their rules.  And don't think they'll do anything to remedy the situation.  They won't.  Booked 12 rooms for a week.  When we didn't check in on time they sold the rooms out from under us.,2,1

The beds are so hard i barely had any sleep during the night. We asked right away for an other room or a topper. We had to settle for some extra blankets under the sheets. They were going to prep the beds by the time we were back at the hotel. When arriving in the room they were just thrown on our bed.The manager at the front desk was unfriendly and had no customer service skills. His staff was more helpful but he came in between to make sure they didn't try to help us more. The ac was super noise and the water didn't get hot enough in the shower. The paint was falling of in the room ( maybe mold?). The lobby is WAY to warm and was so warm we got our dinner in the room.  It looks like a great hotel at first but if you think it has 4 stars??? I had better experiences at 2 star,2,1
"The room, although touted as ""superior"" was dark and gloomy.  For some reason the hangers in the ""closet"" alcove are about 7 feet above the floor level.  My 5'5"" wife had to stand on tiptoes to reach them.  What do short people do?  We heard intermittent (very 5 or 10 minutes) scraping and scratching noises coming from behind one wall.  This continued all night.  We told a staff member about it, but they continued the next night, waking us up occasionally.  When we checked out the clerk did not seem to be very concerned about this.When I got home I noticed my bill was for a ""package"" rate.  The only thing we got was the room.

Any standard double room is facing an inner courtyard that has a really loud fan which will go on day and night. We asked to change rooms but because all standard double rooms are facing the courtyard, they were all noisy and we couldn't sleep for 2 days. Eventually the hotel manager said the only option is to cancel our reservation - which is not what you want 2 days before NYE when everything is fully booked and over priced. The gym is small, dirty and not fit for purpose at all - basically a basement with 2 treadmills and some weights. Not worth at all.",1,1

Lighting in room was horrible and not able to get two suitcases in room.  Bring your own makeup mirror coz u won’t be able to see. Complained to management and was told they could bring lamps and luggage rack..... but no room!,2,1
"1. The beds are too small for 4 adults;2. The bathroom box doesn’t have doors, so the bathroom was always wet;3. We are in 4 at the room and we have only 3 towels;4. The toilet was leaking, making the floor always wet;",2,1
"Terrible view, horrible lights (sort of hospital white bulbs), rusted air conditioning appliance, awful decoration (a 70's motel). The door was so twisted that you can see the light from the corridor. Another door was so twisted that you could hear a couple having fun (to be correct) : very interesting for children. Shower mixer tap was partially broken. Leaks. Sink clogged with cardboard. Sun deck and swimming pool closed. For the same price, I could have had the far better Hilton Garden Inn New York/Times Square Central or Novotel New York Times Square. Be careful when they say ""I found you a quiet room"" : means that you get a room with a stunning view over the opposite room only a few feet away. Température between 77 and 80° whatever you try.",1,1
These rooms were too small.  The windows were horribly dirty and you could hear all the outside noise.  There was no bathroom door and no trash cans in the room.  The beds were extremely hard and the heaters did not work.,1,1
Where to begin.  Tiny rooms.  Even smaller bathrooms.  A/C did not work and room was hot in December!  Part of Ceiling collapsed on our 2nd night and we were moved.  Luckily we were not hurt.  Offered us zero credit!  Tons of deferred maintenance.  Poor customer service.  Would never stay here again!,1,1
Room was tiny.  Bathroom was beyond tiny.  Part of ceiling collapsed into our room and we had to move rooms.  Luckily no property or body damage.  Offered us no credit for the trouble.  Disappointing.  Would not stay here again!,1,1
Not well managed at all. Took multiple attempts to address problems. Rooms were run down. Bar was overpriced even for NYC standards. Couldn’t even get a response when called front desk. Long lines at front desk.,2,1
"They need to improve in all the aspects. The cleaning is very bad, the beds are uncomfortable, the bathrooms are very small and the personal should be more kind about what deserve the guest. I will never recommend it.",1,1
"The windows are very old, so it is very noisy in the room. Even in the 6 th floor you can hear  nearly every noise from the street.... It was nearly impossible to open the window. The location near the MET ist very good.",2,1
they are living off the location. the room had soiled drapes the bathroom was two star quality despite 4 stars pricing. I would never go back. the decor is dated and worn. its 70s decor needs an update. really disappointing.,2,1
"The hotel seemed an ideal choice for us, given its location. Immediately the staff seemed friendly and the lobby was beautiful but that soon changed when we went to our room and were greeted by a brick wall view from our windows. The room was grey, grubby, dark and depressing. It was filled with plenty of snacks, water and a well stocked fridge. Unfortunately even a small bottle of Fiji water was $5 so we didn’t touch hardly anything. However, upon checking out we were still billed $60. I also left a couple of t-shirts in one of the draws and phoned them to explain but it soon became obvious that I’d never see them again. We felt that the hotel spoiled our trip given how horrid the room was, I wouldn’t recommend it to my worst enemy.",2,1
"The room was not as advertised on Expedia. The room was that of a set from ‘The Shining’ The decor was a horrible red and grey, with red checked carpet. The bathroom quality was very grotty. The room just felt very cheap, like a motel, not a hotel that shines a good light on New York. Staff were pleasant throughout though, but we didnt stay there for the staff! Having been coming to NY for years and will be coming back for years to come, we definitely wont be staying at the Empire again, nor will we be recommending the hotel.",2,1
They state they want to make it a memorable stay and this is what they did. I will never forget about the rotting bathroom doors or the horrible beds. The Aircon/ radiator that pretty much didn't work and made a horrible noise the entire night. They should be ashamed of themselfs for taking peoples money. Needs closing down and renovating,1,1
Beautiful lobby and potentially nice atmosphere.  When I woke up and wanted a cup of tea they wanted $3 for a kcup for the room.  Walked next door to Starbucks.  Room was seriously drafty with a heater that did not work.  This place would be so cool with a little effort.  Instead that nice lobby is full of slightly irritated guests.,2,1
"This was my second time staying at the Empire and will be my last. I typically do not write reviews, but I feel obligated to share my terrible experience. Upon check-in, the staff did not offer to help with luggage. I was traveling with my mom and daughter and we were definitely overloaded. The staff was downright rude at the front desk and we were duped into our accommodations. We were placed in an interior room with a “courtyard” views. We were told the room was quiet. Hahaha... Well, the view was of major piping, clearly the empire needs to do some landscaping, and from 6:30-past midnight our room was loud with banging noises because it was next to the staff room! No guest should EVER be placed in this room.I also called the front desk 2-3x with no answer. I had to go",1,1
"The location was the best thing about this hotel. The room me and my friend booked should not be advertised for 2 people (even the toiletries were only for one person when we arrived and had to leave a note to get extra as 2 people sharing). We shared this tiny overheated room with bathroom so small, you had to step over the toilet to get in and close the door behind you. Our room had no wardrobe - unless you call a rail with a curtain a wardrobe. Deposit box was faulty, so couldn’t use it for my passport etc, we had a lovely man coming to check it out and were told the box is very old and we should get a different one. Whoever was in charge with that never made it happen, so I ended up carrying everything like passport, all money etc with me. Our shower was also temperamental",2,1
"Easily the worst hotel I’ve stayed at in at least two years — as a New Yorker, I was familiar with the lobby and rooftop, which are nice, but the rooms are far behind in terms of quality and badly in need of an update. To start with, I’ve stayed here for almost a week now and the heat has not worked properly a single night. The staff provided a space heater for me because none of the 4-5 engineers that were sent have been able to fix the heating unit; the space heater doesn’t have a thermostat, leading to many nights where I’m woken up by it being either too hot or too cold in the room. There is also a strange smell in the room, sometimes of chlorine and sometimes as if someone had been smoking in it before. The bathroom door won’t shut without hitting the toilet. Not worth the",1,1
The room was not very clean and kind of run down. We were on the 10th floor. We couldn’t get our room to cool off and it was 30 degrees out. We kept the windows open while attempting to sleep and it only went from 77 to 76 degrees. They did nothing to fix it nor did they get us into a similar sized room. The door men were all awesome though! We ended up at the Lombardy and it was amazing!,1,1
"Although the city was incredible, unfortunately the hotel was not. The hotel sign was not even fully working, and then we got to our room. The bathroom door was a mess, the shower appeared to be missing a door and the blinds were stained. No member of staff we spoke to introduced their names throughout our whole stay and some weren’t very helpful either. Upon initially entering the reception, I was very excited as this is an interesting environment that I was excited to experience however our room was extremely disappointing. The only saving grace for the hotel is that we were able to spend every second possible away from our room and the city is the most spectacular I have ever seen!",2,1
"This shabby over-priced dreary hotel's sole attribute is that it is close to Lincoln Center.  If you are willing to put up with an undermanned/unhelpful registration desk, a problematic  ""complementary"" WiFi that keeps wanting you to subscribe to a pay-for version,  a tawdry room with a unexpectedly good bed then book at your peril.  I do repeatedly.",2,1
"Great location, that’s all the praise I can give this hotel. The rooms and overall hotel is dated, bathroom was tiny and inneed of replacing. We were on the 10th floor and could hear traffic and busyness of streets below. No restaurant or room service!If you like luxury DONT STAY HERE.",2,1
"When booking my trip I purposely didn’t go for the cheapest hotel as didn’t want to stay in a dive. The pictures I don’t feel the pictures online accurately represent the rooms provided. Location is good, lobby is nice but the rooms are sub standard. There was a lot of cracked paint, wall paper coming off the wall and day before I left noticed marks on the door frame to the bathroom which looked like mould. Deposit debited from my account multiple times and water stopped working on the last day so couldn’t have a shower.New York is a great city, just a shame the hotel let it down.",2,1
"I was in a bind and chose this hotel out of desperation and regret it.  I knew nothing of it's reputation as a place that has appeared in TV shows and movies. The decor is 20 years out of date. The lobby is basically a night club after 5pm and the furnishing show lot of wear and tear.  My room was on the interior side so dark that even at midday it felt like midnight. The furniture, carpet and drapes looked just as old as those in the lobby and was torn and stained.  The bathroom was ridiculous. The sink faucet was so low that it nearly touched the bottom of the sink making basic functions like brushing your teeth or washing your hands nearly impossible.  This new trend in hotels to do away with shower curtain in favor of the half-glass wall and some water saving shower head",1,1
location location location - they say -  Lincoln center  It is one of the most elegant and fascinating spots in the city. The hotel is perfectly located between Columbus Circle and Lincoln Center. Transportation by subway it is always very convenient and you are just steps away from Central Park. The facility it is starting to show the signs of age mainly in the rooms. The rooftop bar has an  outstanding view  both  in the night time and with daylight.,1,1
"Me and my partner stayed in this hotel for 5 nights, first time in New York City! Hotel was very disappointing. Very old, bathrooms are awful- very small, old, mouldy. We had a room on 10th floor and facing the street, noise was unbearable from traffic, even that high it felt that it was right next to us, so no good night sleep at all. The only good thing was location, 15min walk to time square, and very close to Central Park. Staff was average, some friendly but some looked pretty missable. There are loads of better hotels in same area for same money so wouldn’t recommend to stay in this hotel.",1,1
"It was my first trip ever to New York I chose the empire hotel because I heard it was a 4 star hotel, it has been used for movies. So I felt safe by choosing that one and it was very well located. When I checked In they gave me a first room, the carpet was dirty, dusty, the room was on with a street view and badly insonorated so you I was hearing everything from the streets in my room it was horrible. The bathroom was old dirty with no towels. I went at the reception asked for a second room.Then the second room I had was dirty, had moisture and there was hair on the sheets. I asked to check out immediately,and they didn’t let me. They said I couldn’t check out before my end of the stay. I asked them to refund me they didn’t want not even compensating.I left the hotel without",1,1
"I booked a room at Empire Hotel for my boyfriend's birthday thinking that based on the location, pictures, other reviews, and my previous trips to the rooftop bar. Boy was I wrong about what I would be walking into. I literally think they put us in a janitor's closet. I understand NYC is strapped for space, but the room was so small that you could barely walk comfortably around the bed without jamming your shin into the bed frame and could not get into the bathroom and close the door without straddling the toilet or getting in the shower. Topping on the cake was the fact that the thermostat was broken so it was a sweltering 90 degrees the entire night. So for someone who is an asthmatic and has major sinus issues the sleep was the furthest from a dream that you imagine when you",1,1
"As promised a crib , waited 2 hrs ,awake,waiting for crib , at 1:00am they informed me there were none , ordered when booked room, 6 weeks prior, recomfermed week of , expected at check in, lied to for 2 hrs. No warm water switched room still no warm water in sink.only cold.really ripped off on price.",1,1
"Got a room on the first floor, just above lobby floor. There are HVAC units just outside my window that are so loud I cannot sleep (I don’t  have a problem sleeping on airplanes). Safe didn’t work and never got fixed during my stay. Very outdated room. Great location though.",1,1
"Don't be fooled by the facade and photos online. This was my second time staying at the Empire and I was incredibly disappointed with the service and room I received. My room looked out to another guest room that was probably 10 ft away. The AC did not work and was incredibly loud. The shower did not function properly and had no shower door thus soaking the bathroom floor. The front desk staff were incompetent and I have never waited that long to check in to any hotel. On a positive note, the doormen were very courteous and helpful. Also, the breakfast buffet at the rooftop was very good value.",2,1
We were expecting to spend a nice week in this hotel.Upon arrival we realised the room was extremely small for the three of us. There is no storage space in rooms. 2 small drawers and you can hang your coat next to entrance... That's all about it.The carpet and curtain had stains and the towels smell weird. The air-conditioning system is probably 10-20 years old. If you want to switch it on or off you have to remove the lid which allows you to take a look inside and see how filthy it is. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. Book a cheap motel and you'll have the same experience.,1,1
"The hotel location and the receptionists were excellent, but the room the gave us was not the expected one. We asked for the Minibar that was included but they told us that It had an extra cost. All that for the same payment.",2,1
"The room was tiny and the bed was too hard. Thermostat didn't work and room was unbearably hot. Heater rattled and was noisy. Bathroom was barely functional. For the price, they should at least offer coffee to go in the morning.",2,1
Walk the few extra blocks from Lincoln Center and stay at a nice hotel.  Front desk bad.  Room bad. Service rude.  Room service non existent.  Way too little for its full service price.    Best part is lobby bar if you’re looking for that sort of thing.  But sleep somewhere better.  Like a Motel 6.,1,1
The room I booked online was for 2 queen beds.  They gave us a tiny full. When I showed my reservation they dismissed me shortly.  They were not accommodating front desk was rude dismissive and condescending.,1,1
Good location but not satisfied with how the hotel handled our finding of a cockroach in our room. They gave us a voucher for breakfast which we found to be not very good. The bar and breakfast is very expensive. Good location near Columbus Circle and the Lincoln Center.,2,1
"Warm service and the entrance lobby is nice. We had to ask for a change of room. Windows don’t fit, are drafty and street noise is really bad. We were given another room barely better. The maintenance guy told us all the rooms in the hotel need new windows. This is pretty bad. On top of that $5 for a 500 ml bottle of water says it all! Tired, in need of an upgrade and overpriced - I would love to have more good to say about it but I simply can find nothing more.",2,1
"Visited this hotel during a family trip to New York as my daughters wanted to try out the rooftop restaurant for brunch. Visited on 11/11/18 and the setting and view was amazing, as was the young girl who greeted us when we arrived. However our server was unhelpful and appeared as if she was barely listening to us when we ordered our food. I ordered a lobster sandwich and both my daughters ordered chicken and waffles, however one had to be sent back as it arrived covered in sauce when my daughter had clearly stated “sauce on the side.” My lobster sandwich consisted of 4 mini toasted sandwiches with a tiny amount of mashed up lobster in them, it was so disappointing. My daughters did not particularly enjoy theirs either and in fact that night both of them were vomiting, can’t",1,1
"Not a great value for the room, not so clean, interior is dark and gloomy. Location is good staff are very friendly. Tiny bathroom with no room, very small sink, tv channels are average. Can hear the noise from the neighboring rooms. Some insects are running in the bathroom.",2,1
"Upon arrival the desk clerk was very pleasant and told me she was giving us a room ""with a view” like it was a special favor. The room certainly had a view- of bright lights that could not be screened out because there were NO curtains, just two sets of grubby looking mini blinds. There also was no heat. It was frigid and windy yet the unit in the room was blowing out cold air. Neither of the two thermostats in the room made a difference. At about 10:00PM I went down to the desk as no one answered the phone. I said the heat wasn’t working and they said someone would be up to fix it. I took the dog out for a walk and when we returned we remain in the lobby for a time with the rest of my party (also staying at the hotel). I went back up around midnight and the heat still wasn’t",2,1
Rates quoted by this property were twice as much as accustomed to for services provided. Would suggest That my fellow trip advisor travelers offer half of quoted Rate. Can’t recommend this property in good faith.,1,1
"Was supposed to get a preferred rate with the LiDestri group weekend of 11/9-11/11, was told to call Emily Antin, and given a phone number. Tried for 3 weeks to call and left repeated voicemails, never got a response. Eventually someone picked up said 'Executive Offices' and transferred me to Gianna. Gianna's voicemail said 'this is the desk of Emily Antin'?? Left two voicemails, never got a response. Also during this time I called through the main number a dozen times to the awful voiceprompt system. With the voiceprompt system one of several things happened: - the voice prompts didn't work OR - I dialed 0, got the front desk, was transferred to leave a voicemail that was never returned OR - after supposedly transferring me to 'Group Events' it would ring non-stop and then hang",1,1
The hotel is nicely located at the upper west side  Lobby is nice and reception person was nice too.   BUT: the room. See for your self and make up your mind.   Lots of stuff that needed replacement long ago.   The curtains dont go all the way down. Only one free electricity socket and basically not what I'd expect from a hotel in 2018 at nyc.,2,1
Stay away  there are much better deals forget about proximity to Lincoln center.  I could not wait to leave.   Loud noisy street noise bathrooms terrible so small.  Worst hotel I have ever stayed at.  We traveled in a group all echoed the same feelings,1,1
"Booked a Deluxe room...paid about $550 due to NY Marathon weekend.  Placed on 3rd floor streetside for max street noise thru very thin windows.  Discovered no room service when I called because restaurant was closed for renovation (advance notice would have been nice.) Room did not have any of the normal items one might expect from a hotel like this or were listed on Hotels.com. No coffee maker, no mini bar, robes, turndown service and not even water for purchase in the room....front desk told me “if you call down we can bring you a cup of water.” WHAT??!! Apparently you only get coffeemaker above 4th floor which I only discovered upon checkout.  They tried to get me tea about ten PM but had “no teabags” and I couldn’t use the Keurig pods with electric water kettle they brought.",1,1
The only good thing about this hotel is the location. The elevator is scary feels like it will break at any moment. Room was so old feeling. Musty smell. Couldn’t shower without over flowing onto the floor. Water would not drain. No window or fan in bathroom. Sheets on bed were dirty and stained.,1,1
"Watch out: it is shabby, dirty, noisy and everyone is truly unprofessional.   After two months, we still do not know what we were exactly charged for. Isn't it our right?  NO, AT HOTEL EMPIRE, YOU GUESTS HAVE NO RIGHTS.   We were a group and reserved in March for October.  Each one of us was shocked upon arrival to see that the rooms were completely different from the ones showed in photos. One of the guests left to go to another hotel. Rooms were dirty to the point that they had to change many of us. Black water was coming from the sink. The AC was loud and either too cold or humid.There is no place  The reception was a true mess. Never passing notes on to the next one in the rota. We had one inconvenience after another.  They kicked us out of the rooms by mistake hours before",1,1
"This hotel is very run down. There were also long check in lines upon arrival which isn’t great when on a business trip. The Bathroom was not stocked completely. Smoke alarm chirping from old batteriesAnd finally, cockroaches spotted in bathroom.",1,1
"I paid $650 / night for this suite and it was disgusting. The room was dirty, the bathroom was filthy (crap in the shower), no coffee maker, and there was no control over the temperature in the room. I couldn't get out of there fast enough.",1,1
"About the only thing the Empire has going for it is location. Check in was chaotic, although the clerk was quite friendly. Both the corridor leading to our room and our supposedly ""superior"" room itself were dark and dingy. The main overhead light in the room had only 1 of 3 bulbs working, and the three-way lamp had only one setting, presumably the dimmest, working. There was no full length mirror in the room, and if there was a coffee pot, I never found it. The doormen were friendly, if a bit informal. We met friends for drinks after the opera in the lobby bar and the waiter was surly. But, if you're attending something at Lincoln Center and/or want to be near the number 1 line of the subway, you won't find anything more convenient.",2,1
"- The Hot water was the biggest issue, it took a solid 10 minutes of running water before it ""began' to get warm - The room was very cramped and difficult to move around in - The bathroom was also cramped and you need to close the bathroom door to get to the toilet paper..... however if you did not close the door upon entering the cramped bathroom, you would have to stand up from the toilet to allow the door to close while in the bathroom as the Toilet paper was behind the open door.... - The lighting was dim - Not all the outlets would hold a plug in them and upon trying to charge a phone you will find your plug falls out of the outlet.... - No Concierge service, so told to call the front desk with any suggestions but when calling the front desk they don't answer -However good",2,1
"When arriving in this hotel the lobby looks quite interesting.  That's the best part of the hotel. The room  we had was surface clean only.  The shower tray was old, grim and needed resealing, bathroom doors chipped and flaked. Windows dirty along with the blind and filthy by the air conditioning system. Would not recommend. Staff were excellent and felt for them having to fend off disappointed customers.",1,1
"If you want a good night sleep, this is the last option for you. As it's in the middle of Lincoln center with so many road across - it's impossible to sleep. And oh by the way, the AC units are so old and dangerous, it keeps making striking and squeaking noise if you turn it on. You can also hear everything your neighbors are saying as there is no sound proof. And lastly, I know it's New York but man...the rooms are so small.",2,1
"I made a reservation at the Empire Hotel for 2 nights for over 100 people. Although in the contract we agreed on a check in time at 3 p.m. a lot of rooms were handed over to us more then five hours later. When I complained to the receptionist, the only thing she said was: „I am only a human being and I cannot work under a pressure. And now I am working under a pressure.“ Till our departure there was nobody responsible who I could discuss and solve the problem with. When I wanted a written confirmation to be able to solve it later, I was always promised to get it, but in the end I have not received anything! Still not mentioning that although in the contract we had superior rooms, our people were given rooms with a view of tiny and dark court yard with terrible noise from air",1,1
"This was a nightmare of a stay. The ac was so loud that it could not be run while attempting to sleep. The outside building HVAC was even louder, so opening a window was not an option. There were bed bugs (or something in the room that bit me) and the tv remote never worked (went through two). There is no space in the bathroom, so you have to put your products in the sink while getting ready.. staff was friendly, and the shower was nice",1,1
"we came to the room at 00:30 am and an extra bed was not ready yet, hostile staff at the reception, the radiator did not work, bad bathrooms and windows. I would praise the maidens and the location...",2,1
"Not a great hotel. Wont stay here again.  Best location is the reason we came. Chipped paint on doors, water splashed onto floor due to door less shower.. Noisy location near the elevator. We will not return.",2,1
"I've been in your facility for 9 days. I asked to change rooms because it was too noisy. as soon as I changed room I realized that I had forgotten an envelope with the jewels in the previous room and I notified the reception who told me that the room was already occupied and that he would ask the cleaning ladies. for the whole period of stay I asked all the reception staff news and they all replied that they would investigate and let me know. Nobody ever let me know anything. I asked for information every day. Result, lost the jewels. congratulations for the work done. I will certainly do a good publicity to your Hotel. Shame on you.",1,1
"Stayed here for a business trip recently because of its proximity to Columbus Circle. It’s located in a great neighborhood close to restaurants, shops and the park. From the point of check-in, the staff was friendly and helpful. However, the room was in disrepair and felt quite dingy and dirty. I saw some reviews reporting bed bugs, so I did a full check first thing when I arrived. I didn’t find any, but luckily I was in an ADA room and since the bathroom was large, I was able to keep my luggage in there just in case. I didn’t mind the ADA room until it was time to shower. The roll-in shower was backing up and I could tell it would flood, so I had to be quick. This explained the completely rotted baseboards, swelled wood and moldy caulking. The bathroom did have a very strong",1,1
"Hotel requires Updating. Room looks uncleaned and bathroom unsanitary. Good Location with surrounding amenities including  Central Park, Lincoln Center, Theater and Restaurants. Early room access was denied and a late check out was an additional half an hour if needed . The staff onsite was somewhat helpful.",1,1
We were treated unfairly by the Empire Hotel. Their cavalier attitude towards are our situation was alarming. We have made many attempts to resolve the issue but we are still being ignored. We cannot recommend staying at this Hotel.,1,1
Hotel has much potential but it’s outdated and looks run down. The staff could be friendlier and waiting over an hour for towels interfered in our plans. The breakfast was okay but charging extra for smoothies for an all inclusive breakfast wasn’t appreciated.,2,1
"I thought it was strange that I didn't receive a response back from the hotel when I requested as""asistance finding a wheelchair to rent for my 86 years young mom.  I received an email the day before asking me if I needed anything and my anticipated time of arrival.  I responded with the time and reminded the hotel I would have a wheelchair and would need some assistance.  Upon my arrival the front desk didn't mention I had a special request at all, I had to ask them about it and then they looked puzzled and embarrassed that they hadn't responded to my emails.  The hotel was sold out so they could not provide us a necessary room.  The result we stayed in a room that we could not even take the wheelchair into it. The bathroom wouldn't even allow one person to stand in it and",1,1
"The room is so small it’s barely maneuvable. The curtain pull broke, the drawer wouldn’t stay shut, the outlets were finicky, the sink wouldn’t drain and there’s no shower door...that was the first night. The next morning, no regular coffee pod. I called and they did fix some things. They told me to put more towels down for the shower. That’s just how it is. The next day, a roach. That shower is the worst and the beds weren’t even comfortable. It was a $1000 for 3 nights, and that was a conference rate. What?! Horrible. Do NOT stay here.",2,1
I would give this zero stars if that was an option! I travel weekly for work and don't have the time to write reviews but I feel I must warn anyone considering staying here to find another hotel. Any other hotel!!! It was $475 per night and it was worse than an motel.   This hotel is so run down. I received a handicap accessible room because it was the only one left. When I took a shower my entire bathroom flooded. The drain wasn't working and there was about 5 inches water pooled. (see photo) When I called the front desk no one apologized. They didn't care that I could have slipped and hurt myself. I had to get ready for my meeting with a man in my room with a snake trying to fix the drain!! How is that acceptable? I took a shower the 2nd day and then didn't stock it with,1,1
There was an awful moldy/mildew smell in the room the entire time we stayed. The in room heating cooling unit blew hot air even on cool making the room incredibly uncomfortable. We were traveling with a large group and many people including ourselves got sick during the stay. It’s clear this hotel is not well maintained but the location is excellent.,1,1
Staff aren't helpful and neither are they pleasant.  There is a charge for internet use and for bottled water so it feels like a very budget experience but the room rate is not budget.  Fortunately I only had to stay for one night - the rest of my trip was spent in another hotel which was far more pleasant and much better value,1,1
"Arrived in the evening in NYC for a three night stay. The AC was on full blast in the room, it was freezing. Called to see how to turn on heat. Told no heat yet turned on in the building only AC available. Slept with down coat on. In the morning awoke to NO HOT WATER. Was told I and others who had no hot water would receive $50.00 credit. Didn't show up on my bill. (Called prior to check out and manager tried to deny and offered me $25.00 instead (Seriously!)) Spoke with front desk again re freezing room. Told they had portable heaters but all being used ( No kidding!) but assured me when people checked out later that day I would get one.Offered a $75.00 credit for the heat problem. I never asked for any money, I just wanted a room that had heat and hot water. Again, returned to",1,1
"No glasses in the room, in fact, glasses are not allowed.  No heat, intermittent hot water, no thermostat, AC and heat regulated by 1950's manually adjusted window units -  all for $400.00 per night.  The only thing going for this hotel is its location across from Lincoln Center.",2,1
I didn’t think to check the sheets on our bed before I slept in them with my 4 year old son. We woke up to find that we had slept on some else’s somewhat fresh blood! What’s worse- “best” the hotel could offer was $150 off of a room we paid over $300 for.  They didn’t seem at all concerned that we slept on blood- kept referring to it as an “inconvenience!!” I wish we had checked here/yelp before we booked as it turns out bed bugs and maintenance have been a huge issue in these recent months. Lessons learned the hard way :(,1,1
"Your location is spectacular but the value is missing. The rooms are tiny, the bathrooms are too small, there was no hot water and the room was stuffy despite having the a/c on during the day. The night we were there it was cold out and though we wanted heatbwe we're told it wasn't available.",1,1
"I will never stay here again! From a staff who doesn’t answer the phones and was mostly rude, to broken pipes in the sink, broken lampshades, and not getting room service when I was gone all day. Having to switch rooms 3 times for YOUR MISTAKES and then being charged twice on the deposit. AWFUL! build in some decency to your policies.",1,1
"I booked this hotel based upon the TripAdvisor star rating.  I spend 30-40 nights per year in hotels across the country.  The Empire is definitely not worthy of a 4 star rating.   I rate it a 2 star.  For the value and price of this hotel, the traveler has many better options in this great city.",2,1
"Some bathrooms are tiny. I could not stand directly in front of the sink/mirror because it was so close to the wall it was facing. The toilet was tightly placed between sink and shower. Rooms that should hold two, really only hold one comfortably. The on-site restaurant closed, but fortunately there are several decent to terrific restaurants very close by. There’s a place to sit a computer bag or purse, but no where to set luggage and open it; not even a luggage rack to use. They take all bathroom towels and wash clothes each day; even if hung up on a bar - little concern for the environment (or apparently) their own containment of costs.",2,1
The room was 500$ an night but only it had two beds and a bad corner for a living room. The Breakfast was 20$ per adult and 10$ for a kid. if you stayed for three day with a 4 person family you would spend 180$ on breakfast and 1500$ on an room!!!,2,1
"We stayed here a few weeks ago and were really disappointed with the hotel. It's location is very close to Central Park, but other than that, there is not much around this area. The whole west side seems to be undergoing major roadworks, and most of the buildings are heavily cladded with scaffolding -including the entrance to the hotel. One morning I awoke and opened my blinds, to 5 workmen peering through -from the building opposite- and we were on a higher floor!! The reception area is dark and dismal with no natural lighting, and the decor in the corridors is bold ,dark and a bit overbearing! We upgraded to a suite- but even it was fairly basic-e.g.  we had a curtain over an inset for a wardrobe ! The room was also dark.The worst part however was the shower which the hotel",2,1
"There was black mold on the ceiling, I killed a roach in the bathroom and the general condition of the room was not very clean. Cannot recommend this hotel even though the location is great and the lobby is beautiful.",2,1
"I was not going to do a public review but the hotel sent me this link so I will.  The hotel is in the perfect location if you want to go to the opera, symphony, or the ballet.  Its also a great location if you are going to a Broadway show.   Thats where the positive comments end.Many 3rd party websites give discounted deals and I booked this hotel (3 rooms) via Amoma and Dealon - the Dealon interaction was ok but the Amoma reservation was not.  The hotel admitted the error was on thier side - I got the correct confirmation for dates in my email, but when I called the hotel to confirm they had the dates off (they had us coming in Monday and leaving Thursday vs Arriving Thursday) - this caused me tremendous stress and time to ensure the reservation was fixed as my family was",2,1
"A well located hotel next to the Lincoln Centre. Friendly staff except for one not interested duty manager. The hotel public area is fine although the threadbare patches in the carpet on the mezz stairs warns of it becoming tired. Our room was supposed to be an uprated room,  it was tiny.It wasn't possible to stand in front of the sink so one had to lean over the cramped toilet to wash in the sink!The rotten bathroom doorframe and bathroom door was 'interesting ' as was the peeling paint in the shower. Half cut holes in the ceiling (why?), rusted noisey ac that threw water into the room...Drawers we had to wedge shut.No internet... you get the idea.The managers response, no sir I  don't doubt what you say I'll tell engineering... she didn't say go away but might as well have",2,1
"The room was very small, dark, and freezing when we arrived. I tried switching the delapadated unit to heat, but no hot air came out. The room was very dark with not enough light. Hi he next morning I took a cold shower. The dial was loose and it wasn’t until the second day when I realized I had to push forcefully while turning the knob to get hot water to come out. There was no bottled water in the room, no room service, and the mini fridge was on the floor in the middle of the room.",1,1
"Hotel needs renovation and a good cleaning team, restaurant is bad, furniture is too old an unclean, carpet smells and is clearly dirty. Ac units don’t cool enough, ac control is obsolete, room service is terrible",1,1
"Despite the lovely rooftop bar, the rooms at this hotel are very dilapidated. I would not recommend sleeping here, especially considering the high price. Our bathroom flooded twice and we were told it would be fixed after the first night, but it was not. The rest of the room was rather dirty and dingy.",2,1
"I was disappointed by this hotel since I had heard fairly good things and the location is very convenient.The staff is friendly and trying to be helpful but my colleague and I both requested rooms away from the elevators.  We met each other back at the front desk moments after we had gone up the elevators because we had both been placed in a room RIGHT NEXT TO THE ELEVATOR.  Both of us - different floors, different check in agents! I got a slightly larger room but the curtains were stained, there was a random piece of tape on the wall above the bed and one of my very flat pillows had been cased in what looked like a pillow protector with the zipper open and the tag hanging out. I all gave me a very skeevy feeling. Also in a room where it is hard to get around a king size bed it",2,1
I would not recommend anyone stay here. Super noisy. Couldn't sleep a wink. Bathroom was super dingy. No tissues. No coffee or water. Its like a motel experience with nice decor. When I complained staff told me it was just a very noisy hotel and didn't move me to another room.,2,1
Horrible service goofed up my room the first night me and my wife have been out without children in 12 years gave us the wrong room. Tried to fix it gave us a different room so they're going to drop the price +30% off never did or at least I don't know if they did because I cannot get anyone to return a phone call or an email or talk to me about it I mean come on really I paid a lot of money for this I can't anybody return my call.,1,1
"Good location, but the hotel is sadly in need of an overhaul. Chipping paint, doors that looks as though they have been bashed in, dark, lights were so dim I couldn't see in the bathroom. Engineering did come to swap out my light bulbs. My colleagues shower handle fell off the wall. Smell of chlorine everywhere.",1,1
"Don’t be fooled by the pictures....This hotel is terrible. I booked a corner suite and checked out after 1 hr. The overall hotel I worn down, dirty and very bad maintained. Windows in rooms are so dirty you can hardly look through them. When you in-room AirCon starts you will not be able to conduct a conversation over the noice (if the AirCon start that is) Do not book this hotel!!!",1,1
"Although they are slowly improving some parts of the hotel (in room AC) they still have an issue with sound isolation and especially the windows.  So, if you look for quiet... This is not the place for you.   I personally was quite displeased with the patronising and almost rude attitude from Pasquale. When you are a many times returning customer, voluntarily downgrade yourself to have a quiet room, dont take breakfast (because if lack of sleep due to the noise) and suggest them to offer the beer and coffee (yes coffee, first is complementary, after you have to pay !!).  I was amazed by the poor commercial approach and the almost lecture I was about to be given on the fact that the mini bar and breakfast were different things ! Sir, you need to review to your hospitality basics.",2,1
"The lone bright spot was the friendliness of the staff working in the bar and at the front door.  Everything else about this hotel screamed ""past its prime,"" like a middle aged former high school quarterback still banking his popularity on his play in the big game against the rival team.  I get it - your hotel had a recurring role on CW's ""Gossip Girl"" - but it is time to let that go and spruce up the place.  The facility itself is old and crumbling (literally, in the case of the front desk), which is likely why the lights in the hallway and bedrooms provide very little illumination.  The aesthetic of the hotel is dated.  The king sized bed I ordered actually turned out to be a full size.  The room was musty smelling and the in-room AC unit made a wheezing sound.  The view out",2,1
"We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights. The lobby area is lovely. The rooms are ok, however the air condition is ridiculously noisy, making it unusable when you are actually in the room. The lack of a door or screen on the shower means the bathroom floor is soaked every time you use it. We were very disappointed that the room we were given looked out onto other rooms so close you may as well be sharing and were above a dingy yard. Staying for 7 nights you would expect better than this. The rooftop was closed for private functions on most nights, they let us up there one night even though it was a private function as it was late and charged $34 for a double gin after telling my daughter it would be $16!! rooftop 'pool' is extremely small. We had to pay $150 deposit on arrival and",2,1
"The location was good but the rooms were very noisy - between room HVAC and street noise with less than sound proof windows. The front desk were slow on check in and check out and very unhelpful when asked questions or help. The lobby bar is nice with fast and friendly waitstaff.The room funiture is tired and the beds only has a bottom sheet - no top sheet, just comforter. We found the bedding to be too warm given the second rate AC unit in the room",2,1
"A room that was grubby, in need of a good clean and a shower that was not working properly.We would never recommend this hotel based on our room, to anyone and would look else where for our next trip.",1,1
I stayed at the empire hotel for my honeymoon for 4 nights during my 1 month travel around the states. The lady who checked us in was fantastic and very helpful in telling us places to go as we live in Australia... When I checked out of the hotel I believed that I had paid all of my accomodation and the hotel would just refund the $150 bond that was authorised but no instead they charged my card $1245 while still holding the $1385 so overall I had $2500 being taken/held from the hotel... When I called to question this (as this is not how it’s done in Australia) the lady I spoke to was very rude and told me I would only receive the $150 back not the full $1345 so I was exteramly annoyed thinking I had paid $2000 for my accomodation after I emailed the hotel and spoke to the,1,1
"Good location and overall amenities. Poor room furnishings: the bathroom door was misaligned and wouldn't shut; same with the double door between the bedroom and the living room; a bedside table and lamp were missing; the living room couch tilted forward, making it impossible to rest on it; the unit was not well lit.",2,1
Won't recommend to others. the room is not lit very well. there is literally no room to move. hotel condition is very bad too. not value for money. Only good thing is that it is close to central park so you can go out for walk.,2,1
"I made reservation for 4 rooms including largest suites for my son wedding. 4 1/2 months and 2 months the hotel gave a tour of suite to my son and his finance. We arrive at 2:30 and they told us the room would ready at 3:00 at 3:02, we were told that they gave a room to someone else and the suite is NOT available. We privatly told two different stories: 1) a high profile customer came in and took the room 2) the owner of the hotel has decided to use the room himself. This was dispactable act and so so unprofessional.",1,1
"I had high expectations when I booked this place, the location is great, but other than that everything needs to be inspected when staying. Our room smelled really bad, just damp and the bedding was a little damp and just smelled bad as if the duvet had not been washed. On our second night we had a massive cockroach running through the room. We were given drink vouchers which was very nice by the GM for our anniversary but when we tried to use them, the bartender accused us of writing 2 instead of 1 on the number area of the future. He was rude and unprofessional. They were however very understanding when I had to cancel 1 of 4 nights due to a cancelled flight.",2,1
"I’ve had issues with this Hotel multiple times on business trips. I’d never in my life recommend to anyone. There’s no shower door in any room, which is an odd design because the floor easily gets wet leaving the room smelling like mildew. However this is the least of my complaints. I was charged for a mini bar that I didn’t use AT ALL! Plus I was charged for all 7 days of stay on my card that they asked to put on hold for damages etc now it’s been nearly 3 weeks and accounting hasn’t called back and I’ve called about 7 times.",1,1
Extremely noosy in the room given the noise coming from outside Aircon and broken window.Broken items in the bathroom. I would not recommend to pay such a high price for poor quality of the room atmosphere.,1,1
"The location is great but the hotel is run down. Room 114 was one of the worst hotel rooms I have ever seen. Everything in that room is old. The drawers would not close, they kept rolling open. The air conditioner made a lot of noise. The room smelled bad. The speakers out in the hall were crackling. We went back to reception and they were very friendly and moved us to 222. That room was better, but also old. The air conditioner made a lot of noise too. The little fridge in the room was warm and the safe was sitting loose on top of it. We would not stay here again. It was the disappoint of our trip.",2,1
Booked a suite months in advance yet upon arrival was told the room I booked was unavailable and instead could only stay in a lower level room. The Hotel’s explanation was unclear as the manager gave no specifics and overall did not sound credible. To make matters worse the inferior room given instead was not ready even though my arrival was well after the initial check in time. We were very disappointed as we were looking forward to this stay for months.,2,1
Great location. But the hotel is extremely dirty. The bathroom had here in several places that wasn’t mine. The bed sheets were extremely dirty. The heating and air-conditioning unit had no controls. The upstairs bar,1,1
"I reported a water leak in the toilet and after my 6 night in the room nothing had been done. But the icing on the cake is that I received a delivery and three times the staff denied having it despite having signed for it to Fedex. I had to call Fedex and get them run an investigation, I also had to get the security of the hotel involved, which after reviewing the cameras found my 13x11inches package! Finally at check out their system was down and they promised to send it to my email, but again that didn't happen.",1,1
"Broken AC in two different rooms. 1st room it didn’t work, the room was 81 degrees when we got in there. It took a call, waiting 15min for a handyman that never showed and then going down to the desk to resolve another 15min. 2nd room the AC stopped working in the middle of the night. Unbelievable. Try sleeping in a humid 83 degrees room. It was awful.",1,1
"The room is very small and does not have enough closet, all furnitures are too old and beds mattress are not comfortable but location is very good and close to shopping mall and time square, price is high and service was not good.",2,1
"We had booked to stay for 5 nights and had to check out after 1. Woke up to multiple cockroaches in the bathroom and room. We went to reception and were not even apologized too. They were not shocked at all hinting that this must happen regularly. They were not bothered that this now left us without a room for the rest of our trip. Worst of all we were charged FULL PRICE for the night we stayed and we had to wait 15 days for the refund for the other nights.The room was very dark and dated, the photos have been takes years ago and are very edited. The pool is tiny and grubby, definitely wouldn't swim in it. The window was taped together and all the furniture was chipped. There was a tray and coffee machine but no coffee, tea or mugs. The corridors and lifts are all very dark and",1,1
"The hotels location is good, but the rooms are not. If you’re looking to overpay to stay near Columbus circle, this is your spot. The rooftop is their main selling point, but if you’re going for room quality, it’s not worth it",2,1
"Lobby looks great but the rest is in serious need of cleaning and refurbishment . The roof top pool is minute and area around grubby . Our room overlooked disgusting internal yard with extremely noisy air con units outside ..bathroom was rusty ! Furniture chipped stairs filthy, lifts felt dangerous - staff unhelpful - not quite Gossip girl !!!",1,1
"We love this location and have stayed here dozens of times over the last 10 years but this hotel is getting really tired. This trip our air conditioner didn’t work and after being told multiple times someone woild come look at it, they didnt. Instead they brought us a fan. The room was close to 80 degrees all night and it took multiple calls the next day to get it looked at. The place was booked so they couldnt move us to another room. They finally sent a tech to fix it and while it did kick on, we still couldnt get the room below 73 degrees to sleep. The staff is friendly and has good intentions but we will not stay here again. The pillows were lumpy and tired. The window literally fell entirely off the hinges when we opened it. This place could use a big dose of TLC.",2,1
"I honestly don't know how anyone can give this hotel a good review.  A party of 8 of us stayed at The Empire for 3 nights on a recent trip from the UK to New York, having chose it based on it's proximity to Central Park.  When you enter the hotel the reception looks nice enough, however as you go up a few floors you notice that the decor is dated and the carpets are grubby.  Our room was tiny with only a curtain for a wardrobe door. The bedding was fresh but the rest of the room had a musty odour and paint was flaking from the bathroom door and around the skirting boards.  The carpets, though hoovered, hadn't been cleaned in ages.  The roof top terrace was accessed through a dingy stair case and consisted of a pool which was dirty (and closed off) and a small seating area with",1,1
Small rooms that need upgrade. . Bathroom was like a closet. Ice machines were not available and you needed to call front desk and It took at least 30 minutes to receive. Roof lounge was very nice. Pets were allowed.,2,1
Describe the service you experiencedTell us how you liked the room- did not like the room it was dirtyTalk about the location & amenities -location is greatSay what you liked best & least- the location of hotel is the best thing about this hotel,2,1
The hotel itself is nice and the employees are very helpfull. Though there are a lot of noises commimg from the streets since the windows are very thin. The pool is also much smaller than on the picture on the webside.,2,1
"the hotel is in a great place now for the bad news we stayed for 5 days in which we had 3 different rooms the noise in the back of the hotel was unbelievable I complained and was offered ear plugs you cant write this next room same noise only higher up offered breakfast not a great idea when you have not  slept  all night still not unpacked 3 day moved again but not till 1500 hours finally unpack and share the 6 hangers between me and my wife so I got one the room is small tired and not very comfortable after another moan got back ""£65 off my bill of £975 they said it is not there fault where the hotel was built the noise was from generators at the back of the hotel it was not my fault they decided to rent rooms next to generators but that was that would go to new York again",1,1
"I have stayed at the Empire many times over the years and have always been treated with kindness and respect.  This summer I was coming to New York for three full week, one of which I spent at the Belleclaire Hotel (which I would return to next time), a reservation booked by someone else.  I couldn't wait; I would be at the Empire for 13 days!  How wonderful that would be! I would be a two week resident! This time, my room was dark and wet,(a wall leak), the bathroom door wouldn't close, my wifi was ""iffy"" and the shower was not working well.  All of which I could overlook and did let staff know.  Staff was nice but I didn't check my bill when I checked out and something I didn't realize that the 2 cent Keurig cups were not complimentary.   I was charged over $32 for crappy",1,1
"I chose this hotel because my mother stayed there 2 years ago, she told me the hotel was great and fine regarding the price... I booked a standard room for 2 nights for 300 dollars per night, expensive for me but why not, after all we are in Manhattan, in a nice district.  We travelled from very far, we checked in with a man so rude (short guy, no hair, glasses), I unfortunately don’t have his name. I have been surprised (in a bad way) because, the check in is the first impression of the establishment. I am working also in hospitality industry, if someone welcomes our guests like that in our hotel, I will say to this guy: do you really understand your job or what ? You are supposed to welcome the guests and not to make them uncomfortable !  Anyway, the receptionist told us we",2,1
Went in for a quick visit and thought the empire would be great due to its location and having been on the rooftop for a cocktail prior.  The rooms were dated and felt dirty.  The pool area was not well maintained and the pool was tiny. Definitely not worth the price.,2,1
"Where to start.... First impressions upon checking in were actually quite good, nice door staff and receptionist appeared very friendly. We upgraded to a superior deluxe (or something to that nature) and the room was the size of a shoe box, had no shower door, paint cracking in bathroom, paint in glass of bathroom door.. I could keep going for quite some time. Another couple from our party booked a standard double room yet there's was literally at least double the size of ours?? After informing the reception staff we were told all other rooms were booked so nothing could be done, needless to say it was a pretty dismal start to our stay.  We were here as a party of 8 for a wedding, the hotel bar doesn't open until 5pm and no room service is available which we weren't told until a",1,1
"Stayed here for two nights last week,very disappointed firstly we paid in cash upon checkout and made a point of asking to make sure no money should be taken from my bank,we were assured that it would not be,unfortunately it WAS, not happy as it cost me a fortune phoning from UK to sort out.The hotel looks tired and in need of a good clean!our Windows were filthy!!!could not see out of them.we paid a lot for two nights and were very disappointed.",2,1
"I never leave reviews, but this hotel was absolutely dreadful. It was disgusting, dirty, paint peeling, rude employees. They close the pool early. They don't answer the front desk phone when you call, or return it.",1,1
"Tiny rooms, ridiculous small bathrooms, old-fashioned decorum. In addition we were informed of works in progress in the lobby only 3 days before our arrival. I would not recommend this hotel to my friends. To be honest, the rooftop is a pleasant place.",2,1
"So I travel a lot. When I come to NYC I usually stay at The Empire Hotel. My company books me here. I'm a easy going guy. Doesn't take much to make me happy. Clean room. AC that works and smoke free environment.  My last stay here a few weeks back, I was put in a room that clearly had been smoked in. I am very sensitive like a lot of people to smoke and the toxins in cigarette smoke. I called the front desk and promises of a visit from someone that may be able to get an air filter or something to help me. No one came, no calls came in to my room.  Fast forward to last night. As I was sweating my butt off last night, I called the front desk and let them know my room was not cooling. They sent up a box fan.  So then hours later there was air moving but still very little cooling.",2,1
My husband & I stayed at the hotel to attend a wedding in N Y C. After requesting an early check in because I was recovering from an injury we waited in a line of over 20 guests trying to check in. When we finally were given the room key I was shocked to find the room was already occupied & I had awakened a sleeping baby opening the door. We went back to the reservation desk & had to wait in the line once again before we could talk to anyone . Finally. we were given a key to a second room. It was not occupied which was a plus but there was a dresser wihich you had to circumvent to get to the bed. The dresser’s drawers unfortunately would not stay closed and there was no way I could navigate. There also was no coffee for the Keurig. An employee was sent up to rectify the,2,1
"I was really looking forward to staying here but unfortunately I was disappointed. Hotel needs a renovation, it’s tired. Pictures of pool are misleading it’s small. Expect long waits for anything at reception, no room service, no breakfast included. Staff are friendly and cleaning staff excellent but overall this was overpriced and a disappointment in terms of quality, accuracy and service.",2,1
"Room was small, but that’s New York for ya. Hotel staff was rude, the staff on the roof was lazy and inattentive. Not only was one of our chairs broken, but the server came over to take our drink order, my boyfriend asked what beers she had and she looks at us and says “oh you don’t have a menu”...and it all went down hill from there.  Great safe location, easy to get to everything but their are hundreds of other hotels worth your time!",2,1
"Great location for theater at Lincoln Center complexes. Great Subway access. Surrounded by excellent restaurants. Staff was very friendly, and hotel was bustling with guests. Rooms are small and needed remodel/renovating in bathroom. Great hotel if you are planning tours and theater and not needing any downtime in your room; they are small...this is a less expensive option for being so close to Central Park.",2,1
"This is an email that was sent and never responded to, other than I’ll get back to you. No one ever did. Scott,  Are you certain that you want authentic feedback?  The service and attention has been shockingly absent, the facilities loud and in some aspects very filthy, staff has been at times obviously annoyed and there is not even any coffee in the rooms. I reached out on another email and was not responded to, other than I’ll get back to you first thing in the morning and no one did.  I am not the loud person complaining and making a scene about the noise and inconvenience of the construction just to get items compensated but I am definitely not satisfied with the service from your hotel staff.  I would be happy to sit with you and share what I have noticed and what has",1,1
Dark and dreary.. lobby was being renovated.. WiFi is additional for rooms.. this is more like a motel. In fact I would recommend one over this.. staff were friendly for New York standards however as for something and 2 days later was told it was on its way.. checked out a week later and still no sign or mention of the I phone docking station that was to be in the room. This hotel has the potential of being great but not quite getting there on all fronts😐disappointing to say the least.,2,1
"I frequently visit NYC Hotels, and this was by far the worst customer service experience I have ever received.    When I asked for a private place to pump breastmilk while waiting for our room to be available, the woman at the front desk offered the bathroom (not a comfortable, nor private place to pump) or the mezzanine lobby (not at all private).    I could not believe the woman at check in would suggest those places for someone to pump at, when I specifically requested a private space.    The hotel pool was extremely misrepresented in photos.  When the woman at the front desk asked what I thought of the pool, I told her that at this price point, I would not expect broken lounge chairs around the pool.  Instead of sending someone to fix it, she responded that they sometimes",1,1
"My husband and twin toddlers arrived early for our stay and were nicely greeted and informed that our room was not ready but we could keep our bags with the bellhop until available. After coming back to the hotel, I was handed 5 bags with no offer to help to my room or use of a cart. The hotel was under construction so navigating through the area was tight with a double stroller and multiple bags. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. To then come to find out that there is currently no room service offered because it is also under construction was very discouraging! We have two kids and choose our hotels based on convenience. We stayed here last year and had a much better experience! We sadly wont be back or recommend to anyone in the future.",2,1

"We made a reservation for 3 rooms and kindly asked for lower floor rooms by email a few weeks before our arriving.   Lisa confirmed by email that we will get lower floor rooms so I confirmed our reservation.   Unfortunately upon arriving and despite showing a copy of the email confirming our request we were told that it will not be possible to access to our demand.   I explained that my booking was linked to this demand and should have I known that we would not receive lower floor rooms I wouldn’t have confirmed.   I request to speak to a manager and he explained me that we should not worry as it will be easy to change of room in the coming days which never happened in spite of my multiple reminders to the staff.   Moreover,the air conditioning was from another time, so noisy",1,1
"We stayed at this hotel in June.  I can say our room look absolutely nothing like the pictures on the web.  The room was small but we expected that in NYC.  The shallow sink that wouldn't drain, the shower without a door and pieces of the shower head lying on the floor, no place to hang dresses as well as being dark and gloomy were some of the features we found disappointing.  The bathroom was so small there was no place to put hair and makeup items except on the closed toilet lid.  The feeling in the lobby as well as the hotel in general was shabby and worn out.",1,1
"My young daughters and I wanted to see a show and I booked a room with two Queen beds. Upon arrival they told me that they didn't have a room with two Queen beds and instead they are upgrading me to a room with one King bed. I told them this wasn't an upgrade since the three of us couldn't fit in one Kingsize bed. They went back & forth and finally gave me a double King bed. The room was really average. Once I left they charged me for everything they could, a charger and the whole content of the minibar! I fought it for 5 months, finally got my money back but will never stay there ever again!",1,1
cheerful and very helpful staff kept me in this hotel. otherwise i would have requested 100% refund. 601 bathroom is worse than a $50/night motel bathroom. poorly maintained. feel like if you touch anything it will fall apart. room cleanliness was an average. hotel name on the building is not fully lit up. room ac is way too noisy and filthy looking.  didn't really want to put my hand in a small compartment to adjust the temperature. very poor internet and even so poor cell service in the rooms.,2,1

"Upon check in, industrial fan was running in the floor and entire carpet was soaked, shower hose leaking which we temporarily fixed somewhat- staff gave us towels for floor um ok. Many calls to Mgr incl vm went unanswered, ac was not functioning - nobody answered front desk or concierge lines either day we were there. Never had such a bad experience where nobody cared!",1,1
"Do not put anyone in that room. The door is not to code, bathroom is not to code. Ceiling was leaking and paint was coming down. Keurig was complimentary but had to wait 45 minutes for coffee, should it be prestocked in the room if it’s free? When it finally came, housekeeping didn’t bring water. I guess they expected us to use bathroom water. Pool is tiny, pool deck waitress forgot my husbands order and he waited almost an hour after I received my food. Overall very disappointing experience!",1,1
"I get it...most NYC hotels are a revolving door, literally & figuratively and it's difficult for hotels to be refurbished. The room my daughter & I checked into was dreary, extremely noisy from the street especially at night. So noisy that I bought a fan from the store to cover the noise and lackluster A/C performance.The bathroom was moldy and the shower leaked all over the floor and lacked an exhaust fan. I was willing to overlook all of this and just write off our selection of this hotel as a mistake until my daughter experienced a severe medical emergency while in the hotel. She was having an allergic reaction to a baked good purchased elsewhere & was in the hotel lobby waiting for the ambulance when her boyfriend needed to administer her EpiPen. Because she was at risk for",2,1

My first time to New York to celebrate my birthday. The experience would have been much more memorable if the hotel would have lived up to its review and photos online. That’s all I have to say!!!!!!😣,2,1
Over all the hotel was beautiful inside and out. Including the room I was given and the people that worked at the hotel. The thing that was terrible was that with the value payed there was no air conditioning in the room when it was about 90 degrees outside it felt like 95 inside the room.,2,1
"I have stayed at this hotel for years, I used to recommended to everyone. Unfortunately, that is not the case anymore. The facility, along with management, are falling apart. AC did not work and the overall infrastructure is showing it’s age.",2,1
"There’s a reason the rate is too good to be true— there’s NO AIR CONDITIONING. Completely unacceptable for a midtown hotel— and 4 Stars?!? What a joke! Changed room 3 times to finally be told by a manager “Well, it’s an old building and it’s hot outside so all the guests are using the AC.” Shame because the hotel and amenities are actually nice and the location unparalleled. But lack of AC in the summer leading to humid, moldy rooms?! Changing hotels tomorrow.",1,1
"I traveled to NYC from Minneapolis with my sister and elderly parents. I pre paid for our rooms,  however there was an issue with their website which changed our check in and check out dates. The Empire was very accommodating, appearing to resolve the issue.  I have multiple emails claiming it was taken care of.  Upon check in,  only one room was noted as pre paid.  I was charged again for the second room in my reservation.  Upon discovering this,  the front desk staff was as helpful as they can be.  The charge was reversed,  but not until I arrived home.  In the mean time,  the $150 refundable deposit had to be paid.    In the days since I have arrived home (Stay was July 7-10th) another almost $360 in charges has appeared on my account.  Calling,  emailing the hotel has not",1,1
"We arrived at 12:30 on 6/29 and checked in knowing that the room would probably not be ready for us since it was before 3pm. The front desk person said she'd put us on the rush housekeeping list and would call us when our room was ready.  We didn't receive a call so we waited in line again at 3 pm to attempt to check in.  The front desk person said our room was not ready, but would be in 15 minutes.  We tried again at 4 pm and were told it was not yet ready.  We tried again at 5:30 and was again told the room was not ready.  They said one more hour and gave us a temporary room. We checked back at 6:45 pm and were told the room would be ready at 7:30 pm. When we checked at 7:30, the room was not yet ready but it would be ready at 7:30.  At 7:30 pm, Luis at the front desk said",2,1
"Turns out the AC units on the top floors are not capable of cooling the rooms in the summer. You'd think they may want to fix that. Their solution was a tiny electric fan that did next to nothing. No excuse to charge people NYC hotel rates to sweat in a room all night long.  Location is fine, and room was adequate.",1,1
"We had SO many problems at this hotel. STAY AWAY AND BOOK ELSEWHERE. Location may be good but it is NOT worth it.  Many other guests had similar problems to us and staff DO NOT CARE.   - Room not ready upon check in, no one could tell us how long we would have to wait (ended up being able to check in one hour later) - Room was DIRTY when we checked in. There was a NEW and WET coffee stain on the floor. We tried to call down to have this clean but after five tries we gave up as no one would answer - Bathroom is tiny, can barely fit in there.  - Draws in the room will not stay closed - TV constantly gets “no signal” - People are the front desk are SO SLOW with any kind of request - Key card constantly stopped working  - Wifi did NOT work our entire stay. We were told by front desk",1,1
"I don’t typically post reviews, especially bad ones, but this hotel deserves an honest assessment. Poor customer service (we requested a fan three times but never got one) and inadequate air conditioning resulted in a disappointing stay. Only reason this hotel gets a 2nd star is the location.",2,1
"Extremely badly maintained hotel. Old AC, broken appliances and tiny terrace with poor service. You need to do serious investments. Breakfast (paid separately) poor quality. The fact that restaurantvabd terracecare not managed integraly is annoying for customers",2,1

"Despite its stellar location across from Lincoln Center and genial, though unresponsive, staff, this hotel is a total ‘no’!  Poor, if any AC, TVs “all around hotel don’t work” (according to front desk), dark wallpaper in halls and rooms — all decor is stale by 50 years, halls are not much more than 3” wide. The Empire desperately needs to be bought by a firm that knows what they’re doing, then gutted and rebuilt. Don’t book!",1,1
"Horrible hotel. To begin with the air con was either on or off, no in between, and to turn it off you had to pull the plug out of the wall where you would get a mini shock as you were not able to turn it off by a switch before unplugging, it also rattled very loud so I was unable to get any sleep. The room looked like it had not been cleaned it weeks, I bumped the lamp and a pile of dust fell on top of me. I went to have a shower, which was broken as well, and the shower floor had mould on it and I also had to pull someone else’s hair out of the drain in the shower, which also didn’t drain properly, along with the sink as well. The room smelt like chlorine 24/7 and there was dirt and marks everywhere. Worst hotel I have stayed in, you can get much better hotels for the same",1,1
I was not happy with The Empire Hotel at all. I did not like the contemporary shower with one glass door. The queen standard room was like a match box & the room was not clean. Mold in the bathroom and wall paper coming off around the room and chipped pieces of the door were off and coming off. It was convenient because of the location but I would never stay here again. Not worth the money.,2,1
"Stayed at the Empire for couple nights. The location is fantastic. Great restaurants, close to subway, central park, walking distance to the theater district. More importantly, not a loud noisy place to sit down and meet people for a conversation. Very nondescript.  But now for the negatives: There was no hot water for shower on the morning on June 28th.  I had to go to business meetings without having showered. Disgusting feeling. Yikes. Plus it was hot and  humid in NYC and felt miserable all day. Also, I had to check out on the same day so had no time to wait around for them to fix the problem. When you check in make sure to ask if there is running hot water. Ask them if it was broken anytime recently.  If they answer affirmative, stay there at your own peril. Having said all",2,1
"Started the day with no hot water. No answer at the front desk, and eventually not much of an explanation. Room was hot--poor ventilation system and no central AC. The staff is nice and the lobby is beautiful.",2,1
"Location is superb. Just out of the hustle and bustle but still very much in the heart of NYC if you’re visiting as a tourist. Central Park is a 5 min walk away and Times Square a 10 min walk away.   Hotel itself is very run down and old. Poor lighting in the rooms and the whole establishment. Old wallpaper and carpet. The lifts are extremely slow and make you feel slightly uneasy. Shower pressure is good but the bathrooms are TINY (and I mean small - honestly, barely fits one person) Air conditioning is a box in the room that makes so much noise, but staff are friendly are very friendly.   On Fridays and Saturdays, this hotel turns into a mating ground for young people. The empire rooftop bar is a popular place and gets completely rammed and lots of people end up booking rooms",2,1
"This hotel is situated at a beautiful location, very close to Central Park, ballet en Symphony hall. Lobby and bar are nice, bit Art Deco-ish. Reception staff courteous. So far so good!  The elevators are very slow and take ages, the carpets in hallways and rooms are worn out and very smelly. On my floor there was a constant low level ‘alarm noise’, there were no clear emergency exit signs. The rooms are for NY an OK size, but were in need for an overhaul and a brush of paint around 20 years ago. The AC is from the 70-ties, made the noise of a large truck, which kept me from sleeping 2 nights. When I called maintenance their comment was ‘But it is cooling right?’ Showers: no water from shower head, only via leaks in hose. Windows have not been cleaned since AC was installed,",2,1
"This is an old hotel that is in need of an update. Bathroom smelled musty, nightstand drawer would not stay shut and pool on rooftop is a very small lap pool.  Requested a room change and front desk could not accomodate ( supposedly sold out !?).  Take a look at our pics. NOT a glass enclosed shower as stated on website, filthy bathroom door, mold on curtains....you have been forewarned.",2,1
Just plain horrible Is all I can say about our experience here. Showed up having rented 4 rooms and understood that we might be able to get early check-in so we arrived at noon.  Didn’t expect to get early check in since it was a busy weekend but guaranteed check in is at 3 PM. We finally got our rooms at 5:30 PM with an apology and nothing else offered.  Had to insist on compensation and was given reluctantly a one drink coupon insisted again that they give me more than one so that I can have a drink with one of our guests who had to deal with two children while he waited over five hours for his room.  At check out the next day asked to speak to a manager and got a call from a supervisor again asked to speak to a manager however a week later still have not heard from the,2,1
"Do NOT be fooled by the location. This is one of the worst run hotels in the entire city. Here is what you can expect. The hotel is rundown to the point where it's laughable. The air conditioning units are from the last century, very loud and have a very loud clanking noise. So if you like sleeping you won't get much of it done at the Empire. They sell tiny bottles of wine for $29, but don't expect any glass glasses. They only supply you with coffee cups to enjoy the overpriced wine. Ordering in, don't bother asking for a fork or a knife. The empire does not have any silverware at its location. Bring your OWN. If you don't mind the hallways littered with huge bags of trash stay here. If you enjoy walking by toilet scrubbers left in the middle of the hallways stay here. When we",1,1
"Day one, we checked in and the AC was not working. They offered to send up a fan while they talked to engineering about the issue. Day two came and they offered to move us to a different room. The second room had a cover for an AC unit but there was nothing inside it. They moved us again. Third room had one working AC unit and the other was stuck on low. I didn't feel like moving again so I stayed in that room. They knew my wife and son were with me but didn't provide a sheet, blanket or pillow  for the pull out bed. We had to ask for them. I asked three times for them to remove the mini bar items from the fridge because they literally take up all the space inside. They never bothered, I ended up taking everything out and putting it in a bag in the corner just so I could put",2,1
"I live in NY and I wanted to get a small getaway for a day of my busy days, to relax and enjoy the day. Main reason I chose The Empire hotel was for the pool in the rooftop, as showing on the website looked fantastic.... what a dissapointment!!! My first impression when I went to my room: a very very small room featuring a Queen bed that looked more like a full bed, I was not happy but decide to go Up to the pool and enjoy the rest of the day.... The pool LOOKS Nothing as the one in the website, is  maybe a 1/3 of the size that is advertised, the website picture is more like a drawn and is very deceptive because the space and the pool itself is very very small... two people side by side can fit in that pool but nobody else, was very bad. A happy note, was the service, All the",2,1
"The hotel looks nice on paper but wooooowww. Do yourself a favor and don’t book here. The bathroom was so small I had to put half of my body in the shower (which has no door btw) just so I could open and close the door (which you must, bc they decided it was a good idea to put the TP behind the door...?). My room was literally a closet. There wasn’t even room for me to open my suitcase anywhere, so I had to put it on my bed every time I needed something. The AC was awful, hallways were a thousand degrees, the pool is a one lane quarter of a lap size pool, and the elevators are shanky. (We got stuck bc none of the buttons worked). 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼",1,1
"Not worth the $$, and I paid less than 150. Small room, and we were upgraded! Clean (ish). I dont know. Looked dustly. Absurd sink setup. I'm size 10, can barely fit between sink and wall to wash hands, do makeup, hair, etc.   Sink wouldn't drain, so hard to brush teeth etc without sink immediately backing up  (I called to have them fix it, which they did). Not as annoying as taking a shower shortly before checkout  (1st time using). Shower head wouldn't stay in place, when I tried to position it, it broke into 3 pieces, with a heavy metal piece hitting my bare foot. I really couldn't continue to shower with what was left. Annoying. At checkout I told desk attendant about it. She very kindly told me ""oh that's ok"". I think she was assuring me I wouldnt have to pay for it or",1,1
"We stayed her for 3 nights and we were not impressed. The lobby looks nice but it went downhill from there. The hallways and by the elevators are dimly lit which may be for ambience but not helpful. The design on the walls in the hallways was nauseating. We decided it was like being trapped in a funhouse. Our room was average at best and not the junior suite we were anticipating. In a 2 bed jr suite with 4 people I would have thought they would have put more than 2 towels. Our beds had no top sheet which we are accustomed to. We had to ask for flat sheets, towels, and wash cloths. It took me a while to locate a trash can. There was one small one in the cabinet under the bathroom sink. The sink didn’t drain well so we had to be quick washing our hands and brushing our teeth. The",2,1
"The hotel is ideally located for the Met Opera House. The lobby is welcoming, the rooms comfortable, the bathroom small and probably needing refurbishment. The hotel seems to have outsourced its provision of WiFi and dining facilities. I was mistakenly charged on my credit card for the free WiFi and have still not received a refund despite multiple emails with the reception manager. I felt there was no ownership of the outsourced facilities and it was not acceptable to have to relinquish ones credit card in the rooftop bar area. This has rather overshadowed an otherwise enjoyable trip to the opera and New York. It’s speaks volumes about how the hotel views its customers.",2,1
My husband stayed here 2 nights for business. He has stayed in hundreds of hotels. He said this was the hardest bed he has ever slept in. Asked front desk for a pillow top or something to put on it and they said there was nothing. Also the shower has no door or curtain on it. Water sprayed everywhere all over the bathroom. Not the best arrangement. For $660/night he will never return.,1,1
"Looked forward to staying at this hotel. It was a birthday holiday and I’d always wanted to go to New York. I picked this hotel but I sorely wish I’d stayed at a Hilton or something more basic as we had nothing but issues. I wouldn’t step foot in this hotel again even if I received a free trip.  As soon as we arrived we were asked for money to cover the room. I’ve never known them to charge you, only to take your card and if anything is taken out of the room, then they charge you and excuse me I’ve travelled a lot I’m no dodo to hotel charges but what I did not appreciate was that they expected DOUBLE the amount at the rate of $300 in cash because we didn’t have a card. I was outraged. I think that is disgusting and I don’t care where it’s written, I’m not a saddo who reads",1,1
"I think since I booked via a last minute app, I was given the smallest, least desirable room available. #741. Impossibly small bathroom. This is the worst room I've ever stayed in in NYC in a hotel of this ""alleged"" star rating. I'll go back to The Benjamin next time.",1,1
"I checked into the Empire hotel late in the evening. The staff at the front desk were friendly, however I found it odd that there were no doormen or staff present to assist with bags. I was quickly checked in and went up to my room. My room looked as though an adult movie was recently filmed inside. There were mysterious marks/stains on the headboard, walls, and furniture. Both bedside tables were filthy, not just covered in a film, but visibly sticky/dirty. The curtains and blinds were both filthy - very odd place to be dirty. The curtain in my room had a visible hand print on it. I'm not joking - a HAND PRINT. There were also questionable stains on the curtain. The bathroom was small but functional, and there was a toothpaste stain in the sink. Luckily the cups were",1,1

Thank God for the girl working along with him, sorry her name escapes me, she helped us with our check-in process and we were able to go to our room after a very long day.  However, when we got to the room, it was extremely hot for which I tried to turn on the A/C, but it was super old and not working. Also, the roof top which is their landmark, was closed, and the girl attending was also very rude and snooty. Bottom line not a very nice experience. Hopefully you'll improve the bed-side manners of your staff.",2,1
"Well it started with more than a 30 minute wait for check in.  Then I had to go back because front desk did not provide any information about location of fitness center or breakfast etc.  The next day there was no hot water in the shower.  Fifteen minutes of calling the front desk and no one answered.  I had to go down in gym clothes to talk to them and they told me an engineer would look at the problem sometime in the day.  So after having a cold shower I went on with my day and came back to find the keys demagnetized.  Front desk fixes and then tells me they don’t have a credit card on file for me.  After I show them that they’ve already taken a $150 deposit on check in, they insist on taking another imprint of the card.    This is the last time I will stay here.  The only",1,1

Rooms small and tight; poor lighting (particularly task lighting); problems with plumbing; poorly maintained (had to change rooms because of various maintence issues); offered 1 tiny bar of soap for the 2 night stay; thin and rough towels; very dated and dark decor; charged to hold luggage until Room was ready. For our $700 2 night stay (which is a deal in this area of NY) very disappointed. Have stayed there before, but it was not this poor years ago.   On the positive- staff is very pleasant and helpful.  Suggest that management staff stay in their standard room for the average person’s experience. Might provoke an update!",2,1
"No hot water at 7am, two of the four elevators weren’t working a day back, pay $3 per coffee pods over and above the 4 assigned to the room upon checkin, no paper or other glasses to drink water upon check in! Air conditioning is antiquated. Why would anyone want to stay here with no significant restaurants or nightlife around either!",2,1
"My husband and I stayed here last weekend in room 741. We were not impressed. The room was tiny and weirdly shaped. The bathroom was so small, we couldn't close the door without stepping into the shower. The shower head was confusing and complicated to use and the shower itself did not have a proper door, so we ended up with water all over the floor. Needless to say, we weren't given a bathmat to keep the water down to a minimum. One of the washcloths was stained. The bed sheet had a hole in it. We found someone's dirty black sock on the floor near the bed, although I'm not really surprised housekeeping had trouble finding it because that part of the room was very dark. We will not be staying there again.",2,1

I was told to have a seat (with others similarly waiting). I told them that I'd run an errand and be back in a half hour. I returned at 4PM and now I had to wait behind about 10 people waiting to check in. When I got to the front of the line I was told that my room still wasn't ready, but it was my lucky day---they would upgrade me. Really? No apology? Did they think that an upgrade is a cause for celebration? Not for me.  The room looked like the room I had booked. I saw no difference. I asked that they send up someone to put linens on the pull-out sofa for my daughter. No one came. It took two more calls to get someone up to make",2,1

I'll freely admit that I should have gone back to the front desk when I discovered that I had been placed in the living room area between two bedrooms with a sofa bed. I was so tired when I arrived I assumed that I must have screwed up my reservation. After all, had I been truly upgraded, the front desk staffer would have mentioned it.

Proximity and the fact that Women in the World recommended this hotel for its speakers was the only reason I stayed there.  It's been a very long time since I stayed in a hotel this bad.  I changed rooms three times and still ended up with a lousy room.  The walls are paper thin, the windows are not insulated for noise, and the doors also allow for full noise from the hallway.  If you are a light sleeper, stay elsewhere.  The decor was tired, lots of chipped paint in the bathroom and stains on the window blinds.

I called from abroad 4 times at my cost to be told the same thing and on the day of arrival, they apologized but told me the family room was available the day after.  The following day, I encountered a totally unprofessional ‘manager’ who attempted to educate me that the problem was for my booking and no room was available until the following day as there was no room.

I assumed this was a mistake, but the front desk said that none of the rooms had shower doors.  2)  There isn't a full size ironing board available, they only have the mini ones so it made ironing my suit for my interview problematic. 3) The room is very small, which is not unusual for city hotels, but other small places have shelves and other things that give you places to put things.  4) The bed was hard as a rock.  I recommended to the university that they stopped putting up their guests here.  If you have interviewing of giving a lecture, you need a good nights sleep and a way to look your best.

"One of the worst hotel experience in terms of hotel staff and room settings.   1. Front desk  Out of three words that front desk lady said upon check in, “last name?”, “incidental is $150” and “enjoy”, I sesed that particular person is tired of working and careless about the guest. She seemed to be focused more on how to get thru the day with bare minimum fake smile and minimum conversation as possible. The lobby was empty and there were no other guest waiting for check in or anything. No direction to the elevator nor internet was givin. Great, let’s ask somebody who is willing to help but not her.

I went to a seminar there in November 2017 and the bag of chips they handed out were dated April 2016.  There is so much they desperately need to improve. It's to bad because its a great property and conveniently across the street from the Lincoln Center.  Even the conference I attended is refusing to use them again.,1,1

"In the room next to mine, what seemed to be a ""Pimp"" got belligerent and started yelling and possibly physically abusing 2 women in his room. These event began around 3am and we called security but it took over an hour for them to show up...there were still disturbances until about 4:30am. When leaving for the job interview in the am there was vomit prior to the elevator entrance on the 3rd floor.",1,1
"This was the worst room I've ever stayed in (and I've been to hundreds of hotels in my life). Elevators were horribly slow. Could not get any satisfaction at the front desk. ""Brunch"" was completely different than the billboard promoting it.Drinks were absurdly over-priced. Stairwells were disgusting.",1,1
"This is not the hotel we have visited in the past. Rooms are still tiny but this time the blinds did not work, the lights did not work, the sink would not drain. Poor maintenance. No restaurant, no room service, no breakfast on weekends. It is relatively inexpensive but much below standard for Manhattan. It is in a good location but there other better options nearby. Would not recommend",2,1
"Web site does not say anything about the $100 flat rate pet fee (when the rooms are $104 a night), does tell you that there is a $25 per night per dog fee, Staff do not know the rules around service animals, They ask for proof of service animal, instead of asking what your animal is trained to do. Lobby is lovely looking, but once in the room you will see a difference. Wall paper coming off the walls, grout coming off the tiles, no shower door and window lets in the cold and all the noise from outside. Check out was easy and the door staff are great, nice and friendly and willing to help. Check in staff can be very short with the customer and this does not give you a nice welcome to the hotel, First and last time I will stay there.",2,1
"I travel a lot for work and pleasure and used to live in NYC. I stayed here for a night in Feb 2018. It wasn't awful, per say, but I wouldn't do it again.   The lobby is beautiful, but the rooms leave a lot to be desired. What really threw me is that there's no free wifi in the rooms... it's 2018... also I had to run the shower for 10 mins to get hot water and open the window (below freezing outside) because the heater had no temperature control. Not even an off switch. To top it off, a cockroach ran out from under my bath mat in the morning. Weeeeee  The location is nice, but honestly you can find better for less $.",2,1
"We arrived at The Empire Hotel on Friday 12th January. I was extremely sceptical after reading the Trip Advisor reviews, however I had booked this trip a year in advance as a surprise trip for my daughter who is a Gossip Girl fan.  On arrival we checked in and were given room keys for a room on the 7th floor. ( We had requested a 10th floor room for the view.) on entering the room we noticed there was only one bed (We had requested two). I returned to reception and was given a new room on the first floor Room 0111.  On entering we noticed the room was closely situated next to a laundry cupboard. What a nightmare constantly on edge because during the day and night as staff accessed the laundry cupboard it sounded like they were trying to enter our room. When opening the blind to",2,1
"do not recommend this hotel. I stayed there for two nights. As soon as I got into my room, I was so excited to finally get some rest. I tried to turn on the tv and it didn’t work so I called downstairs for someone to come fix it. While I was waiting I decided to go wash my face and freshen up a little in the bathroom when I hear someone opening my door. I’m thinking maybe it’s the tv guy but why would he be opening my door instead of knocking? I walk out of the bathroom scared and I see a stranger walking in my room with his luggage. Apparently the front desk gave another hotel guest a key to my room at check in. I don’t understand how this hotel can make a mistake that big. Thank god I wasn’t in the shower or changing! This was a very scary moment for me. Immediately called",1,1
"This hotel is in a nice location and has a pretty lobby.  The room was small but typical for New York City. It has contemporary decor in the room which at first glance looked fine.  But our room had an extremely noisy inconsistent heater. It had a broken keurig machine and no cups to use with it. We stopped at the front desk and they said they would send cups up. After waiting awhile I called down to the desk and they told me housekeeping didn’t have any. There was no hairdryer in the room. Our friends in another room had a hairdryer which did not work. They called the front desk, who was supposed to send one up. It never came. Another couple in our party had to change rooms 3 times before they got one where the heater worked. I’m sure the filter in our heater was filthy. My",2,1
We arrive late Friday night. We were greeted by the desk and  taken  it to our room. Room had no heat. Called downstairs and was told to go to the next level up to the same room number. Arrived unpacked and realized during the night that the heater had two temperatures. One was super hot and the other one was not at all. The room looks nice enough but really does need  a remodel. Woke up in the middle of the night with the room way way way too hot in the windows were blowing in cold air. Next morning we called downstairs and was put in yet another round. This room was bigger and more accommodating. This hotel needs some TLC. It is kind of beat. And there was no room service. The room service people didn’t show up for work. The people that work there were very friendly and,2,1
I have traveled to NYC for business and pleasure for over 40 years. This was the worst hotel experience. My wife and I needed to ask for a room change immediately because the room was VERY HOT and we could not adjust the temperature. Relocated to room 217. Room was very dark. One night stand did not have a lamp. The heater in this room was extremely hard to adjust....it was either too hot or too cold. I burnt my finger while attempting to adjust the temp!  In order to sleep we turned off the heat and slept in a cold room which for us was better that sleeping in a very hot room. The window shades were nearly impossible to put up or down. Paint was peeling on the inside of the bathroom door. The remote for the TV was not fully operable (I suspect weak battery). We found a serious,1,1
"Room was very small and the red chair in the room was old, dirty and had a white stain on it (gross). The bathroom was very tiny. The shower door only covers 1/2 the shower area so the water runs right out and goes all over the bathroom floor. Soaked a entire towel. Then I realized when I was showering there was no shampoo / body soap but I did have 3 conditioners.  I will say we did enjoyed the rooftop bar area and the Front desk during check in/check out was fast with very nice staff",2,1
This was the most disappointing hotel during our three week trip to the USA.   Let’s start with one positive point. It’s location on the doorstep op the Metropolitan Opera House is maybe it’s only redeeming feature.   The staff at reception is not very helpful of friendly. Upon arrival at our hotel room we found the electronic card reader out of order. The security officer had to open the room. Please note that this procedure had to be repeated later the same day. Maintenance only repaired the lock that evening. No apology ever offered.   The aircon in the room was noisy and not very effective.   They do not even offer a complimentary coffee station in the room.   The bathroom was also in need of a maintenance overhaul.,1,1
"This is the seventh time l have been to the Empire Hotel. My room was so humid it took my breath away with the smell and all my hanging clothes stank. To add insult to injury l had a lot of money stolen from my case. It was investigated l was told and the upshot was lit was my fault and l must’ve lost it somewhere else. Great no ? The staff was interviewed l was told and big surprise no one came in my room, well actually they did and when they saw my case opened where the money was they closed the door!  Obviously!!! So there we are ! I let you judge for yourself ! Honesty is not the culture of the Empire Hotel and the client is far from being king! Very sad indeed!",1,1
"The Empire Hotel is well located, which is about all it has going for it. The bathrooms were the most surprising I have seen in decades of travel and certainly at this price. The water never got hot.  Every single shower was freezing cold. I tested the temperature 3-4 times a day over our 4 day stay and never got a hot shower, or even hot water to wash up. The junior suite had a tiny bath with a crazy shower.  One ceiling bulb (shower light broken). The railing was for a normal sliding shower door, but had the near side anchored and the far side removed. This makes it hard to turn on the cold shower, and leads to water all over the floor (see photos).  What were they thinking?  Also why put a soap dish to jab into your thigh?  They put faucets on the sink too low to wash, but",1,1
The room was really a closet.  The bathroom door just missed the toilet.  You had to maneuver to get in the bathroom.  The AC/Heating unit was making painful noises all night.  You're paying for a lobby that you never use.  The view was a another roof top full of construction garbage.,2,1
"Stayed for 5 nights in November, room was smaller than advertised, bathroom the size  of a postage stamp, soundproofing very bad, sounded like the road was running next to my bed. Coffee $3, water $5, Wi-fi charged $9.95 on the website or $12.95 in the room guide per device per 24 hours so not sure what the price actually is. Complained about the room size and was told by the young lady on reception I would get an email from the manage - still waiting........  went for a drink at the hotel bar and asked for wine, there was no red wine at all in the hotel and only 1 white wine, again asked to speak to the manager this time the manger was conveniently on the phone (apparently) by now I had the impression the manager did not even have the balls to speak to customers regarding",1,1
My title embodies what is wrong with the illuminated sign(missing a P) and indeed the Hotel - they don’t care. 1. We were checked into someone else’s room-a first for me at any hotel and very embarrassing . 2. The bathroom is essentially a cupboard. 3.Inadequate noise insulation means day and night New York traffic noise including sirens and horns. 4.Forget breakfast in the hotel - not sure whether a franchise or not but in any event the staff haven’t a clue. 5. A 20% tip is compulsory in the downstairs bar despite the service- overheard last night from the barman’ I have no idea what a Singapore Sling is- I’ll look it up in my phone’ 6. No adequate response to any of the multiple complaints on this website from the management. 7. The only positives -We found the restaurant-Ed’s,2,1
"I suppose that its below market pricing should have been the giveaway, but even at that, this hotel should be a last resort choice and  only for its Lincoln Center proximity.  Rooms are small, dark, and dank.  Bathrooms have black mold.  Showers leak onto bathroom floors; cockroaches at play, and overcharging for internet, in room coffee, and even bottled water; silly nickel and diming is never a good idea.  Odd deal with the on site restaurant and its adjoining bar---food at the restaurant was good but service almost non-existent and bar was manned by thuggish guys who could care less about friendly service--insisting that bar tab be closed (not transferred) before allowing the restaurant hostess to seat us.  On a positive note, the front desk people and doormen were excellent.",2,1
"We have stayed at the Empire Hotel for the last five years. We have also taken 3-4 additional rooms for clients as we attend a conference at the Lincoln Center. It is extremely convenient.   We were in Washington DC on business and called the hotel at 7:30 PM to let them know we were coming by train and we would arrive between 11-midnight and not to give our room away... Upon arrival at 11:30pm, the front desk clerk shuffled uncomfortably and we knew something was wrong. Finally about midnight he gave us a key with no explanation. We went to the room to find a beautiful suite. We tried all the doors and could not find a bed. We called the front desk, no answer. We went downstairs to find we only had a living room. There was a pullout couch if we wanted a bed. And if we wanted",1,1
"My boyfriend booked a room at your hotel for my birthday. He elected to stay at your hotel because your property had a pool, unlike some of your competitors with cheaper prices. He received an email prior to our stay stating the hours and information about the pool deck, so he had no reason to believe there would be any issues once we arrived. It was a surprise he planned for my birthday and it was ruined when we found out that the pool was not open like your website and the email he received stated it would be. The primary reason he book a room at your hotel (which was rather expensive) was because he was willing to pay extra to ensure we had access to a pool. Furthermore, we went to the front desk and added one of my friends to the reservation so she could access the room",1,1
"I really disliked this hotel.  The rooms are dark, not for atmosphere, just unpleasant.  The room is very small- reminiscent of chickens in a cage where they can't stretch their legs. The shower can only be turned on and regulated by standing directly under the water.  I asked for someone from room service to show me how, his head got wet too. The cleaning lady left no soap one day.  Everything is extra$$$.  There is a coffee maker in the room, but you have to pay for using it.  The Wi-Fi for the room costs ten dollars a day.  You have to pay for the computer in the lobby to print a boarding pass. The keys don't work  so in 4 days, I had to come back down and stand in line 3 times  at reception because I was locked out of the room.  The staff, from house-keeping to reception,",2,1
"My husband had the flu and passed out in the foyer of the hotel. The staff were very helpful initially. I got my husband back to bed with the understanding a doctor was on the way. After waiting an hour I tried ringing the concierge, the front desk and room service. I could not get anyone to answer the phone.  A guest in a foreign country is very daunting when you cant get assistance. I finally went downstairs and asked how long before I could expect the doctor. They then inform me that a doctor had not been called and if I wanted one I should just ring 911. I was gutted.",1,1
We visited new york and had 4 rooms in this hotel. Location is amazing. The team not so good. Maybe 2 people knew what they were doing/saying. They kept charging our cards without a reason and kept blaming the system. The money came back to our account but only when we left new york. I will not recommend or come back to this hotel. I kept solving problems more than enjoying my stay.,2,1
"I rarely write bad reviews but I'm afraid this hotel isn't up to par. I requested a street-facing room, and was given a room that overlooked an internal courtyard filled with loud machinery. I would imagine the rooms might have sound-proofing or something to lessen the din (especially as this seems to be a common complaint with guests, based on reviews here). I asked front desk to either find me a room with less noise, or refund me some of the charge for the inconvenience of the noise; both receptionist and evening manager weren't understanding of the issue, apologetic, or able to offer a solution. The noise is a frustrating (and probably solvable) issue, but when basic customer service is amiss it's disappointing; it impacted my stay negatively here.",1,1
"I booked here on a whim.  I stay in NYC every week and honestly usually stay a few blocks up at the Nylo most of the time.  I lived in the neighborhood for years until May and had only been to the rooftop bar in the past.  The rooms and hallways are just beaten down and old.  The hallway smells like cat urine.  My main complaint was there was no heat.  I had a window that you saw the curtains blow and it was closed.  My room was freezing and it was low 50's outside.  I was told that it had to dip into the 40's to have the heat turn on.  Never, ever had I ever run into this at any hotel in NYC in my life.  If my window was sealed it may have been easier but I was basically staying in a room with a 5X5 foot open window.  The staff was unbelievably rude.  I tried to check out",1,1
"Stayed for 6 nights, location is very good and close to central park. Rooms are a little warn down, but otherwise okay. So why the bad rating? I have stayed in many hotels, both on business trips and during vacation with family - this one is so badly managed you would not believe it. We stayed for 6 nights and this is the impressive list of just some of the things that the hotel could not manage:  - On arrival at agreed check-in time, we got a room that was not made up. Feels like walking into someone else's room :-) Well, it happens I guess. Back to the reception again.  - We got a new room, but keys did not work this time. Again, it happens no problem. Back to the reception again.  - New keys are working, yeeees! Oh no, they forgot to make up the extra sofa bed, so we",1,1
"Disgusting service at the worst hotel ever had the misfortune of staying in !  Rooms are tiny and run down, bathroom smaller than a broom cupboard with mould and peeling paint, no ventilation and no room to stand in front of sink.  Moved room to a worse one, air con unit sounded like a truck parked in the room, response from front desk ? ‘ it’s an old system so it will be really noisy ‘, bathroom as bad as first and to top it all, ended up with bites from bed bugs !!! Moved again for our final night to a suite, too little too late. Offered a bottle of champagne to compensate, said bottle didn’t arrive and when we asked we were told there was a dnd sign on our door.....interesting as there wasn’t a sign in our room to use...,did we get an apology? No, we were accused of lying 😡",1,1
"In early September, I contacted the Empire Hotel directly to book two adjoining rooms.  Normally I would book online via Expedia or through the hotel's website.   I called the hotel directly to ensure that the two rooms I was booking would be adjoining.  My family of four with two kids would be staying the two nights in New York and I wanted the two adjoining rooms.  I didn't see a way to do this online.  I requested a king and a double room that connected.  The reservations person said they could do that and include a common living room between the two rooms.  That sounded great.  The first price quoted per night for both was over $700.  I was offered a lower price for the king and double room at $600 if I went non-refundable.  I took that and paid for it.  The total came to",1,1
"We were moving to a new house and needed to stay in a hotel for a week. So we selected this hotel because of the swimming pool for our two children. Upon arrival we were informed the pool was closed for renovation - our travel agency was not informed so first communication incident.  Our first night was bad. The room was hardly big enough to fir the 4 of us (total bill was $2700 for a week by the way), airconditioning was insufficient and noisy, bathroom is lower quality than anything a YMCA can offer these days (no shower curtain, damaged door), stained carpets etc. So I complained the next day but there was nothing they wanted to do : contemporary bathroom design is the management choice, standard AC across the hotel...  Most people behind the reception are too young and",1,1

Requested a kettle before I went, no kettle, asked reception if mini bar could have some soft drinks as I don't drink and son too young, never happened. Everything very expensive,  tea, coffee, restaurant and room service. Best things, maids did a great job, Starbucks next door a life saviour, doormen very helpful. Would not go back or recommend. Did not get told about restaurant, times, what the hotel offered or anything.",2,1
Empire was the scene of 'Gossip girl' and they still live high on that name. Unfortunately quality has fallen and the premises seem outdated and worn out. Rooms are too small and wifi not working as well as expected. Good location but definitely better alternatives nearby.,2,1
"If I could rate this hotel less than a 1 star I would. This has to be the worst hotel in NY got  here sat 21st October had to wait till 4pm to get into a dirty room. Mould in the bathroom, shower that didn’t work aircon that sounds like a truck in the room, peeling paint and damaged doors, cleaners that don’t know how to clean. Front of house manager has no clue how to run a Hotel and keep customers happy!!! Told I was lying by the manager for a dnd sign being on my door, wasn’t even a sign to use in the room. Absolute disgrace.  Just how you want to be treated on your honeymoon !! NOT",1,1
"Yes, its a small room and bathroom but that is expected in NY.  The problem was, as others have stated, its impossible to get anyone on the phone when you have an issue with your room - and I had many.  The aircon was SO LOUD and even though it looked like you could change the temperature, the controls had no effect.  The shower was made really cheaply and sprayed all over the place.  Also very low pressure what little water did manage to go in the right direction.  They gave me the wrong Wifi password and I had to sit on the phone for 20 minutes to get the right one.  Case goods were falling apart, for example the drawer of my luggage stand kept opening up of its own will and I was worried I would bang into it in the middle of the night.  When I notified the front desk agent he",1,1
"In-room coffee service what New Yorkers would call a rip-off.    Only available was Keurig with $3 charge for each cup used.    And I was paying almost $400/night for small room with small bathroom that needed maintenance to fix drain.  AC could not be changed from ""high"" and got quite cool during the night.  All electrical outlets near floor with is nuisance for looking behind furniture to charge phone, etc.   Charge for internet $12.95/day for each device.    Will not go again.",2,1
"The Hotel location is terrific, across from Lincoln Center. All the good ends there.  The hotel information and reception is so horrible.  They are nasty, unhelpful and down right rude.  There is no return information.  Impossible to speak to a person.  Everything is voicrmail.   The Departments do not speak to each other.  If you have a problem billing if off sight so they send you back to the hotel where it is only voicemail.   Ed's Chowder House is worth a try but the hotel book elsewhere.",1,1
This hotel price gouges in a way that is disturbing. For example $10 per day per device for wi-fi access and $3 for having a cup of coffee in the room you paid big bucks is simply unacceptable. Also had problems with the TV and it took a day before they were resolved. I won't be staying there again. Apart from a nice location it has nothing to commend it really.,1,1
"I stayed in the queen sized rooms which are off Broadway a busy street. They are extremely noisy, very small and fairly run down. Noise comes from an outside air system, and in addition the very old air conditioning units which I couldn’t use while sleeping because they were so damn loud. The rooms are also very dark. Maybe to hide the fact they aren’t so clean.  In terms of cleanliness I found a stack of used condoms in my bin from the previous tenant. Absolutely disgusting.    Also worth mentioning the pool is closed from late September if it’s a reason for you to book and Free WiFi is only available in the lobby.   Don’t be fooled by the photos on their website.",2,1
"I rarely write reviews, but our room was so terrible I had to make sure others are aware. I asked hotel staff and management numerous times for help, only to be met with attitude and disdain. No need for specifics, just please pay attention to all the negative reviews!",1,1
"Traveling solo I did not mind the smallish room which I thought was nicely appointed.  The bathroom was fine, hot water plentiful and nice rainfall shower.  Maid service was excellent.  (I did not use the internet or room service.  Nor did I eat the pricey snacks and coffee in the room.) Despite the positives, the big problem that overwhelmed all else was the very noisy fan in the air conditioning unit which literally sounded like a working lawnmower motor.  I tried two rooms and was finally told by staff that the air conditioning units were noisy in ALL the rooms.  I had to turn the air conditioning unit off to sleep.  Fortunately the weather was cool so while the room was warm and stuffy at night it was survivable.  Otherwise I would have immediately changed hotels despite the",2,1
If you need to stay here for the location then go ahead.  It's a great spot just outside of the hustle and tourists of Times Square.  Otherwise it's just a tiny outdated room with unremarkable staff and unattentive customer service.  After our keys didn't work after checking in we were greeted by a tiny HOT room.  Hot because they didn't turn on the air conditioning and there is no thermostat in the room.  Also the room was tiny and we actually paid extra and got talked into an 'upgraded' room.  I hate to think of what the other room would've looked like.  The room and bathroom are so small we couldn't fit the crib they brought us without creating a fire hazard.  We were across from a storage room so there were a bunch of unsightly boxes right in front of our door for both,2,1
"Fortunately we had read the negative reviews on this property so we were well prepared for it.  Because of meetings in the Lincoln Centre area and the fact that we were in NY for one night only, we were determined to tough it out.   Room wasn't ready in spite of early check in request.  Supposedly a ""double upgraded"" room when it was finally ready.  Tiny, poorly designed, a desk/bar with various over priced drinks and snacks. Not a glass to be found, not even in the impossibly tiny bathroom.  Reaching anyone on the phone, whether room service or the front desk or the operator is a test of your patience as no-one seems to be there.   When I finally reached someone and requested 2 glasses, I was told it was hotel policy not to provide glasses as they are a ""safety hazard""!",2,1
"First of all, I am a frequent business traveler to NYC and stay in a variety of hotels depending on the location of my business meetings. Uptown, midtown, downtown. I usually try to stay close to where I am going for the convenience.   Although the Empire Hotel is close to Lincoln Center and the upper West Side DON'T STAY HERE!! As previous reviewers have stated, spend the couple of extra dollars and go elsewhere.   My husband accompanied me on this business/ pleasure visit this time and so as a treat I upgraded to a superior room. IT WAS HORRIBLE!!

A bathroom so bare and spare with a small, broken  pedestal sink, cracked old tiling and an annoying fan that",1,1
"Don’t stay here. There are much nicer hotels within a block or two that are worth the extra few dollars. The only nice thing I can say is that front desk people and the bell staff were polite. That’s it. The manager I had to talk to was not at all polite. In the first room they put me in, the shower had no water. I had to move at 6.30am to a second room. In both rooms, the ancient a/c wouldn’t clunk on until it was sweltering, the sheets were threadbare, the fixtures were loose, and the wallpaper was peeling. The first room had an Ace Hardware power strip on the floor, but the second had just one available plug. When going to check out, I got stuck in the elevator on the sixth floor, and, after jumping out through doors that were slamming shut like something from an Indiana",1,1
"If you want to be near Lincoln Center, the location of this hotel is perfect. The staff is good but my room was horrible. It was very small and faced an apartment building which meant I had to keep the shade down all the time which made the room very dark. The AC unit is one of the old NYC units that is noisier than being on an airplane but without it the room heats up quickly. I never did figure out how to adjust the temperature in the shower (no tub) and they do not supply robes. Just rough towels. The bathroom is also too small and uncomfortable. The outlets to plug in my phone charger were not conveniently located. I won't be coming back",2,1
Stayed here late September for 2 nights. Our room had very noisy aircon that could only be stopped by unplugging the power plug.   The bathroom had loose sink and plumbing that had been broken in the 80s by the look of it. I had to unblock the sink by using a water bottle as a pump and the filth that came out of it was disgusting.   There is definitely a trick to using the shower.   Woke up on the last morning with a bedbug crawling on the sheet.  When I squashed it blood came out of it all over the sheet. I checked my wife's skin and my own and fortunately no bite marks.   This hotel was recommended to us by Trailfinders so if they offer it to you then avoid it.  It is centrally located near central park and that's all I can say that makes it beneficial.   Staff are helpful,2,1
"Great location in NYC, but terrible hotel room! I had room number 206. First of all the window was almost blind (view on a very small and dark courtyard): no day light which is rather depressing especially when you're jet lagged. Second I had the pleasure to ""enjoy"" the noise of the air conditioning units (not even mine that I stopped) and was obliged to wear earplugs to be able to sleep.  The room was clean, but needs refurbishing and was definitely so dark!!!!  The front desk service was ok. The rooftop bar is great as it was warm. The breakfast was average - I think you can expect better for 26USD.",1,1
"The only reason we stayed at this hotel was because of the location, and availability. The room and bathroom were the smallest I've ever seen ,especially in a US hotel. Not only does the hotel need updating, but the carpet  is so worn in the lobby  and the bathroom needs painting and caulking.  The hotel did seem to be clean ,and the front desk and doorman were very friendly, and accommodating.  I had read the reviews on trip advisor ,but didn't have much choice ,again because of availability in the city ,and soaring costs due to many events.",2,1
"I've stayed at the Empire twice on business travel, once in August and once in September.  The Good: The location, directly across from Lincoln Center and along Broadway, just a block from Central Park, is ideal.    The lobby is kind of interesting, decorated in an art deco style.  It has a mezzanine level that is a good place to meet colleagues for a cocktail after work.   The staff is very polite and helpful (when possible).  The Bad: Everything about the hotel is tired, chipping paint, to worn carpets, hideous old wallpaper and a broken down rooftop pool and  barely working A/C units in the room.  My first stay here was in August of 2017 and the A/C in my room barely cooled the place.  My second stay was in September and the A/C was set on a frigid 68 degrees.  When I",2,1

"Visited her in July with my husband and my two children (17 & 9) for four days. On arrival the receptionist made a big thing abou giving us a room with a view, we thought fantstic a view of the foutains, how wrong we were a view of the road! When making our way to our room on the sixth floor we noticed that all the rooms around us had 'Do not disturb' signs on them thought this was odd but carried on. On entering our rooms we struggled to all fit in and move around with our four large case (previoulsy spent the week at disney). First impressions it was very dated and tatty, plugs hanging and , aircon unit dented and hanging off the wall with wires hanging out. The bathroom door hit the toilet every time you opened it the bathroom was that small. There was a interconnecting door",1,1
"I was told that there were no extra charges on checking out but then was emailed a bill for an extra $30 on my way home. Teas and coffees are apparently not complementary though this is not clearly advertised and the reception/customer service team will not overturn the bill. The bathroom door was rotten and the bathroom generally worn out. There was a chocolate peanut from a previous resident on our floor. The dust on the bedside light was thick. They do not provide hyperallergenic pillows as standard. The pool was still not operational. There were no bathrobes, as advertised on the website. The aircon unit was dirty and could not be controlled.  I stay regularly in New York and I won't be returning to this hotel.",1,1
"Expensive, unpolite staff and the rooms... bad, old, extremely small and very noisy. We complained about the noise but no one did anything about it. Stay at another place when in NYC. Not even space for a mid-sized luggage.",1,1
"Bell Hop was gracious, informative and helpful.  Everyone else, not so much.  I had never stayed at the Empire before and am used to staying in great hotels in New York, so was surprised at the lack luster staff and accommodations.    I was not greated at front desk, just asked if I had a reservation.  Asked for a CC, waved it at me and said, ""I'm going to put $150 on this card for for incidentals"".  I replied, ""Fine"".  Then handed me my key cards, didn't tell me what floor, room # or even point to where the elevators were!  I had to go back out to foyer, where there were elevators to be told to go back in down the hall and around the corner.  Room was cramped, musty, loud, some kind of blower out my window, charming, blind was hanging on one end, no HBO, the WIFI prompt was",1,1
"This hotel has one great selling point: the location. But the service is atrocious. I am not the kind of person who complains in a review, but this was too much: 1. I reserved a Junior Suite, because I need a bath tub, for two nights, paid in full in advance. City views. On arrival the front desk said ""Standard Queen, right""? They also said, you have it all left to pay. Untrue. I was exhausted after a long haul flight and did not really take in what the difference was, unpacked and realized: no tub. Usual tiny, cramped New York hotel room with a view of a sheer wall of bricks. Wrong room. I was too tired to pack everything again and change, but when I pointed the error in the morning, they said the rate was non-refundable. So I moved to the Junior Suite.  2. What hotels in 2017",2,1
"The main disappointment at the hotel was the fact that the pool deck was closed, this was the main reason we booked this particular hotel and we were really looking forward to it. It was a major disappointment that we only found out once arriving at the hotel. After hearing this news, we headed to the hotel room only to find the room was very small, totally dark, facing a wall and with a noisy air vent. We immediately headed back down to reception, and to be fair, we were able to upgrade the room after expressing our disappointment, and really appreciated that at the hotel. The lobby area and bar was very dark so didn't want to spend much time in there. Wifi was only free in lobby and not in room.   I think the price of the hotel is made up for by the location, it's just one",2,1
"I wish I had inspected the room upon arrival. We stayed less than 24 hours. Silverfish bugs in shower; dirty air conditioner filled with dust and mold, desk unclean with liquid stains. Requested a full refund for 1 night and checked out. Received partial refund only--Unacceptable customer service.  Bed was firm, with clean sheets. Nice view.",1,1
"Bad Experience. We were disappointed on arrival at the hotel (10/7) to be told that the pool was closed firstly for bad weather, then for maintenance an indefinite period (maybe I think they will not open it until next year) Needless to say that for our entire 8 night stay we were unable to use the pool, especially as it was quite hot in NY during our stay. The gym was also closed.  Despite the Staff at hotel were very kind and friendly our rooms didn't get cleaned for 2 days despite putting the please make up my room sign out very early in the morning.  Unforseen circumstances ( picture attached)..... we will not see you again empire hotel",2,1
"We booked in may this year this hotel because it has an swimmingpool on the roof. This was key for us. Payment was directly made 1260,- euro for 6 nights.  When we arrived in the early Morning our checking lady told us that the room wasn't ready yet. We said No problem we just wait at the pool and Enjoy our stay there.   She was a bit shocked and said: You did not know but our pool is Already out of use for quite some time. We told her that we Where not been informed any way because of this matter. She apoliced for this and we said that this was an key reason shy we made the booking for this hotel. If we had known this we had cancelend the booking and booked an other hotel with an operational pool!  We made the proposal that If we find an other hotel with an pool the hotel",1,1
"The pool was closed, and We booked this hotel becouse of ir, when we complain they trated as a thieves not customers without offering any solution when we salid that we would like to change the hotel, they told me that I have yo pay 5 days, It was increible, they trested me as a thieve not the Customer. Of course I change the hotel, to Watson hotel, close to Empire Hotel, better and cheaper and wondefull pool. I will demand to the hotel to have my money back, The worst experience in my life.",1,1
"Way overpriced Pool was under construction, which they did not mention at the time of booking If not for the pool, not worth the money to go here  Rooms are outdated, dirty  I regret booking this hotel instead of so many others in the area",1,1
"The only good thing about this hotel was that the room was clean. The a/c didn't work, lack of electrical outlets, no full length mirror, make up mirror only adequate for 6' tall women,lack of lighting, bed hard as rock, closet had shelf which didn't allow for hanging suiter.",1,1
"The rooms are VERY small. The showers are poorly designed and will get your tiny bathroom soaked. The lobby AC is never below 80. It is impossible to get any staff on the phone -concierge, front desk, room service, etc'- forcing you to go down there physichally for a simple question or request. Even the bellman at the front door enthusiastically agreed and disclosed that ""everyone"" complains about the above. The lobby is beautiful, rooms are tiny and average in nature.",2,1
"Close to worst hotel I have stayed at. Firstly we had to wait for our rooms to be ready, the pool had been closed for weeks prior to our arrival even though when we booked we ensured that the pool was available. The air conditioner in our room was emitting a damp mist that we reported to the front desk which we were told that maintenance would have a look at it. After 2 days nothing had been done, we reported it again but still nothing was done. Our room was not serviced for two days, no fresh towels. On the third day I asked to speak to the manager and while waiting to speak to her there were 3 other people complaining about one thing or another. The manager changed rooms for us but when we tried to turn the a/c on this one didn't work at all. So we changed rooms again and we",1,1
"The lounge of the hotel looks great, but when you go up to your room you will soon see that that was the best place of the hotel. No room for parking your car, you have to pay for the Wifi which is really bad, the rooms are small and not so great, the elevator makes noise just like the airco and the people that clean the rooms.The pool was out of use. Very expensive breakfast. The only positive of the hotel is the location, near metro and Central Park. But I would never book this hotel again.",1,1
"We stayed at the Empire hotel on the last night of a three week trip. I had only booked it as it features in a TV show my daughter watches and she was desperate to stay there.  We arrived and the reception is impressive. We checked in no problem and were impressed with the size of our room. Two double beds, two large windows and a seating area. On opening the curtains we discovered the view was basically straight into other people's rooms.  It was 10pm but we had travelled from LA so we hadn't eaten since lunchtime. The hotel guide stated food is available in the lobby bar until 2am and the restaurant until 11.30pm. When we went to get food we were told food wasn't available at all that night as the restaurant had closed due to lack of customers. We were advised by reception to",2,1
"We were not allowed to use the pool, housekeeping did not clean the room four days of our stay (front desk clerk replied ""housekeeping was overwhelmed""), one morning there was no hot water for showering, we found cockroaches in the bathroom. We asked to speak to the manager and he never showed up. The hotel never answered our emails. Our claims were not heard at all. A nightmare. We want our money back.",1,1
We booked this hotel for 7 nights from mid July 2017 our main criteria was the pool and this was also the reason why we could accept not being in midtown BUT the pool was closed for indefinitely. Housekeeping choose two days not to clean our room. Every day unsatisfied guest where discussing with front desk or front desk managers about their unsatisfactory stay at the empire hotel. Advertised to have wifi in room but only lobby wifi.,1,1
"$350 a night for a small dark room , no access to wifi as advertised ,  no acess to pool as advertised , no hot water for a shower, rude staff , management fail to call when requested. Do  not recommend this place at all",1,1
"Empire Hotel is memorable because of it's strangeness and art deco ugly.  It's dark and there are wall paper is filled with faceless frames.  What's up with that.  Besides being dark and the room size super small, 191 square feet.  It's cheap and so you get what you pay for.  Overall the hotel is dark, including the Lobby Check-In and bar lounge next to it. The bathroom is so small, it's hard to move around in.  The shower head connected to the 9 foot ceiling was too high for me a short person at 5 feet and couldn't get a decent shower.  It's summer time and the pool is closed.  The rooftop bar is beautiful but always busy and to access it, you must leave the hotel and take an elevator just inside the foyer.  Strange.",2,1
"I have taken the trouble to complete this review because I don't want others to fall victim of this hotel which promises much more than it delivers. The rooms are dirty and noisy - awful air conditioning humming reverberates around all rooms.. it's awful .. like sleeping under a runway! I stayed for a week and the room was only cleaned once during that time - yes no clean towels, no replenished toiletries, no beds made etc..  We booked the hotel for the pool but it wasn't available for the entire week (other guests told me this had happened to them the week before our trip too). The gym was also out of order. The staff were rarely seen - the queue in reception was always at least 30 mins wait.. it's a disgrace!  There are hundreds of hotels in New York - think really carefully",1,1
"Terrible bed, no heated shower- they were out of hot water, they never answer the calls, dusty room and never had the room filled with the things that were needed such as shampoo, coffee, and etc.....",1,1
"I have been staying at this hotel for years as it is close to friends and family in the city and very centrally located. I will no longer choose to stay here. It's been a slow, steady, and noticeable decline. The staff seems indifferent. I called room service and someone picked up the phone but no one answered. Just hung there on hold for an eternity. The doors to rooms 638 and 640 don't easily close which I feel is a safety issue. The pool was closed (summer may not be the best time to repair a pool deck) yet the rooftop bar remained open. No ice machines. They ""bring it right up"" which translates to ""perhaps ice may eventually appear"". I went one for two on procuring ice. There was a room service tray with a bucket of ice and a bottle of half filled wine that sat in the",2,1
"The location of the hotel is good and convenient. Overall the hotel gives the impression of neglect and lack of quality control. The pool didn't work, the fitness center was not cleaned daily, my room facing the inner courtyard had unacceptable noise from the airconditioners, and the aircon in the room took a long time to cool. I guess this is New York, where the customer isn't king.",2,1
"Customer service is nice and they do what they can but the hotel infrastructure makes it like a 2 star hotel at most. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!! The door battery runs out often (!!!!!!), the air on is noisy, the internet slow. JUST: DONT COME HERE ESPECIALLY FOR BUSINESS!!!",1,1
"This is first review I have ever been bothered to write. But for a hotel experience this bad I felt it is necessary.   I stayed here for 12 nights with a friend of mine, visiting from Brisbane, Australia. We booked a superior double double room for US$2,900. Below is summary of our time at the hotel:  1. The rooms are very small, outdated and fairly beat up (chipped paint, no actual light fixture in the room, windows so dirty I was embarrassed to take a photo of the street view). We struggled to fit 2 suitcases in the room. The fridge in the cupboard was also full with mini bar options leaving no room to store your own food or drinks. The TV remote did not work. There was a huge air conditioner unit located on the floor near the window. We had no temperature control over this",1,1
"We were not told the pool level was closed indefinitely, the 'deluxe' double room had no room to swing a cat. Enough wardrobe space to hang 7 items for four people. Only 2 internet devices per room, even though we booked for 3 people. Drinks prices were disgusting......$9 for a average beer. Concierge woman had a lousy attitude, air conditioning was rubbish. The only good thing about this facade of a hotel was the location which was fabulous.",2,1
"No air conditioning first night, new room was being cleaned so we missed part of our show second night, broken outlet was not repaired, no hot water on morning of our departure. Camping in the city. I think they have done this before. I overheard someone being transferred out of our room from the first night for no air conditioning. Nice pictures online. And pool was out of order. That was reason we booked in first place.  Great location though.",1,1
"This is not the worst hotel I've stayed at in my life hence 2 stars not 1, however it left a lot to be desired after my weeks stay in July 2017.  Starting with the positives: Check in was fine, the door men and bell boys were very polite and helpful, lobby was very clean and posh which is to be expected in a hotel of this calibre. The room it's self was clean and a good size and a nice big 6ft bed. There's also a safe in the room which is straightforward to use. They also include a good quality hair dryer under the sink in the room.    The first thing that ticked me off was the fact that my family and I chose this hotel because it had a rooftop pool, which very few hotels have, and having stayed in New York before at different hotels, we wanted something a bit different. I went",2,1
"Other than one concierge who helped us with reservations and the friendly Bellmen/Doormen, my experience at this hotel was very poor. Staff seemed  lost. Rooms poorly maintained. Shower had no hot water. Many minor disappointments that added up to a poor review and experience.",1,1
My partner and I stayed here in July and were left beyond disappointed with our stay. Within minutes of entering our room we discovered that we overlooked the 'courtyard' which houses all the air conditioning units. Even with our unit turned off the noise from the other units below us was so loud that it even vibrated the bed. We called to see if we could move rooms and offered to pay more for an upgrade but were told they were fully booked. We asked again the next day and were told that they were aware of the noisy room we were staying in but there were no rooms available for another 2 nights. So we did not sleep for 3 nights. Surely the main point of a hotel should be that you get to sleep?!! After the third night we returned to reception to double check they could move us. We,1,1
"No apology, no discount, nobody that cares. All I really wanted after a long day of moving was a shower, some tv, and sleep. I got non of the above. As they say, I prefer to be wined and dined before...",1,1
"Firstly on arrival we went to investigate the roof-top pool. It was closed. We asked the concierge why, who told us they had maintenance problems last week and didn't know when it would be open again. Very disappointing as we chose this hotel for the pool deck. And NO pre warning when we could have changed hotels. Seems pre existing per TripAdviser also in June. No apologies just fact sir it's closed.    We asked room service to send up some glasses to our room. Housekeeping told us they could only provide paper cups. Not glass. We have a minibar in our room and we are expected to drink wine and spirits out of paper cups?! I called again to ask for glasses and was told that room service would provide them at 6.15pm. My husband went to the bar and asked for the glasses and was",1,1
"We've made a reservation months in advance and we've never been notified about the rooftop pool being out-of-use. We found that out when we actually tried to go to the pool.  Room furniture was rather old and squeeky. It didn't feel clean at all. Smelly and torn sheets, etc.  The A/C in the room was the loudest piece of machinery I've ever seen. Including a V8 engine. When we told this to the front desk, we were told that they will be transferring us to another room, so they told us to pack and they would transfer the luggage, however after we packed up and leave, we were told that there was a mistake and they won't transfer us to another room. Wo we basically spent 4 hours to pack-up and unpack again. The staff was not friendly at all. So, I regret every moment staying there.",1,1
"So so disappointed with this place...but let's start with the positives. Location is excellent and some staff are very friendly.   Negatives: the pool is closed indefinitely with NO warning whatsoever. We pay a premium for a hotel with a pool, we have 2 young children, yet as my booking is ""non refundable"" I am told I can't get my money back. No director available today to override this.  They have no rollaway beds. I had to borrow a blow up mattress from my friend so both kids can have a bed. (Again no mention on the website).  Moreover I ask them at 1.30pm to make the pull out bed (for the other kid), again at 6pm, and at 9pm it is still not made. I am then given sheets, duvet, pillows and pillowcases. I have to make the beds myself. Yes. I made both beds. Just never",1,1
"Pool was out of action for weeks but Hotel management did not advise us, so we didm't have any opportunity to change hotel  Then they thought it acceptable to cut holes in our ceiling at 7pm whilst we were in the room to install wifi (which isn't free by the way); yes we were not charged for that night nut the compemsation goes little way to fixing a bad experience",1,1
"Booked this holiday for my daughters 21st birthday because they had a  swimming pool.  Be aware the pool is not in use but they do not tell you this when you book the holiday.  The lock on the door was broken so he was unable to lock the door while sleeping in our room at night.  The view from our tiny room was horrendous dirty broken  furniture and rubbish.  There was no tea and coffee making facilities which I had requested when booking.  I complained and was upgraded to a bigger room,  which has a broken toilet handle  and was extremely noisy.  I found the staff at this hotel to be very unfriendly to particularly reception.",1,1
"Let's start with the positives and there are only two:  location and Rudy who I believe was an overnight manager.    I just returned from a one week stay and would not recommend this hotel to anyone nor will I ever think to return again.   Upon check-in I asked to be on a lower level floor simply because if I need to get out, I want out sooner than later.  I was placed in an interior room on the 1st floor.  Like others have said the room was small (not a big deal this time because I was alone).  But, the view was the interior of the building where all the air conditioning units in the entire building converged.   It sounded much like a Jet Blast the entire to night.  To make matters worse when I pulled down the sheets to inspect the bed (yes, I do this everywhere I go) there was",1,1
"Here to get some peace of mind after staying with a friend. Unfortunately what they don't tell you beyond whatever rate that you got online, is that it's under construction. So what that means at any moment you will hear noise. So I check in at 5 PM to take a quick little nap I find that I am awoken within 10 minutes because there is drilling going on. I then calling their kind enough to move me to another floor which I really appreciate right away. But of course a few hours later I find some noise going on and I open my door to find a thorough cleaning in the evening around 730 or 8 PM. This is not normal housekeeping time. Anyway, I then go downstairs to let them know what is going on and the person that was cleaning was nice enough to stop however why would this be happening?",1,1
"I stayed at the Empire Hotel from July 16 to July 21 (work trip). I had fine experiences with the Empire in the past, so I decided to stay there again. The hotel is conveniently located and has a nice rooftop terrace one can enjoy after a long day of meetings.   After checking in, I realized the rooftop was closed, and so was the gym. All that had not been notified to me by the hotel or the travel agent upon booking. On Wednesday night, getting back to my room around 10pm after a long day, I was unpleasantly surprised by the fact that my room had not been cleaned, the sheets and pillows were in a mess, and in the middle of the bed I found... tweezers (see photos). Needless to say the tweezers were not mine. I rushed down to the reception and inquired whether it would be possible",2,1
By the photos this hotel looks amazing ... roof top bar.. roof top pool the lot. That's the exact reason we chose this hotel for our stay.  Our room was very VERY small and didn't have a light.. it had 2 lamps but no light ? And we were also a room facing another building .. so no day light came in either. When we wanted to go to the rooftop bar/pool it was closed ... we weren't told this .. we were rudely told by staff working up there after eventually finding it. ( very badly organised ) We stayed 5 nights at this hotel and not ONCE did we have our rooms cleaned or fresh towels. I am no slob I can clean my own room but fresh towels would have been nice.. and as I explained to the manager.. the money your paying you expect clean towels.. I stay in b&bs more than half the price,1,1
"We spent 4 nights in the hotel, in a standard room. This is New York, so €200 per night for a really small room is to be expected (no view). Imagine our surprise when coming back after the first night the room was not made. When calling housekeeoping we were informed ""we do not do cleaning-if you want a.) new towels b.) new amenities c.) the trash to be taken out "" we would have to call them every single time and let them know if we want some or all of this. After inquiring at the reception we were told that usually there would be room cleaning, but tehre was some kind of problem. Therefore only as to what the recptionist referred to as the ""light cleaning"". And when I enquired about the closed roof top (for the whole time of our stay!) I was just told ""well, do you know the",2,1
The room 106 is a noisy cave and the management refused to speak with me when I asked to be relocated in another room. The hotel is very average. No free internet. No breakfast included. Instead very expensive. For what?,1,1
"I have been traveling to New York for business for the past 36 years and have never encountered such a terrible stay at any hotel in the city. We arrived to find that they ""overbooked"" and unfortunately could not provide us with a room there, although I received an email the night before asking for my ETA so they could have the room ready. They offered to put us up in another of their hotels and send us there by cab. However, it was so far out of the way from out work, it would have caused us to incur a daily huge expense in transportation, not to mention the inconvenience. Finally, Pasquale Auriemma, Front office agent, in an effort to help the front desk manager suggested putting us in a living room with a fold out sofa. All of the decent hotels in New York were booked and at",1,1
"Rooms were not cleaned reception did not do anything about it. cleaners walking round all day, tiny room, paintwork coming off, extremely loud air con, rooftop closed with no sign at reception to inform.  EVERYBODY COMPLAINING STAY AWAY",1,1
"We went for a four day stay. Based on hotel photos on website, we expected a lovely hotel. Unfortunately, the interior of our family room was long outdated. The toiletdoor was long overdue for replacement and downright dirty. So wad the window area towards the street. The aircondition was very noisy but it worked. Two days in a row we received a letter stating that due to unforseen events our room would not be cleaned. On our third day, at 15.00 I went to the reception to remind them that we are a family of four in a very small room and that it needed cleaning. I was not met with much understanding nor service minded attitude but after some time I was promised that the room would be cleaned before the day was over - which it was.  The pool is VERY small and access goes through",2,1
"I booked this hotel without checking the reviews first so after reading all the negative reviews I was dreading the worst. To be honest it wasn't as bad as I thought it would of been, the best compliment I could give it was that it was clean. We had a room on the 5th floor, no views just looking out onto other rooms, we never got any daylight whenever we were in the room the lamps had to be on. The room was small but the bathroom was adequate and no mould as had been described in previous reviews. My biggest problem was with the noise from the air conditioning units from outside the windows, in the quiet of the night it seems very loud. The pool was closed whilst I was there, no notices or apologies from anywhere and the bar on the rooftop did not belong to the hotel. Good",2,1
"On a recent stay, housekeeping never visited my room during the stay. But I did not receive an evaluation. I also did not receive an email copy of my bill!  On this stay,housekeeping was good. AC was inconsistent. Shower leaks onto the floor. Paint peeling off the back of the bathroom door. Internet was horribly slow.  Pool and gym were closed.Front desk staff seems unconcerned about guest complaints. That is totally unacceptable",2,1
"During our stay, one day we didn't have housekeeping service. Other days they forgot to replenish some articles, like shampoo, cotton swabs, towels, etc.  The air conditioner also had a very bad position in the room. If you were sleeping at the left side you died by the cold but if you sleeping in the right side you felt a high temperature.  We stayed for 7 days in July, it was really hot outside because it's summer. The pool deck was closed during our entire stay. We didn't notified about this, I would have hoped an offer for discounts or something. We definitily considered this hotel when we booked because they have pool deck availiable and we didn't have the opportunity to even know de place.",2,1
Chose this b/c of rooftop pool and when we arrived were told it was closed indefinitely. Why weren't we give a phone call prior to arrival?? Everyone checking in had same reaction we did. Why have they not posted this on their web site??? STOP advertising your BEAUTIFUL ROOF TOP POOL...ONE OF FEW IN THE CITY!!! This is BS!!There is NO Pool!!,1,1
"We stayed for 5 nights , first 2 nights my wife didn't sleep due to the noise from the air con and air con systems outside, then moved room. The next 3 days there was no room cleaning service, the staff were really helpful even though they were dealing with numerous complaints about dirty rooms......................."".........",2,1
"If I could give it a 0 I would. Where do I start.. they obviously spend all their money on the lobby and the roof top bar. Although the lobby does offer free Wi-Fi it cuts out after 5 minutes. The rooms are so small you have to squeeze past the bed to get into the bathroom which by the way don't go there. From the mould in the shower, the disgusting drain in the shower, to the dirty toilet it was a disgrace. House keeping need to be fired, They don't even vacuum and even if you place the house keeping sign out AND double check with reception they still don't get done. Their staff are a disgrace and deserve to be fired. One gentleman named Even was incredibly rude, I went down a second time to enquire about house keeping been missed and he literally threw bath mats at me and told",1,1
"When we got to the hotel after flying all morning, they met us by saying they were out of rooms because guests that were supposed to check out didn't because of a storm.  So, we had to be sent to their sister hotel on the East side.  They upgraded us to a suite, however, the ""upgrade"" meant that I now had to sleep on a pullout sofa.  We were then far away from the theater district and everything we had planned.   We were ""allowed"" to come back to the Empire the next night to finish out our reservation.  However, we were put in an awful room with no A/C and a view of a brick wall.  Their solution to our AC problem was to bring us a box fan.  The only reason we booked this particular hotel was because they had a pool.  The pool was closed for repairs indefinitely.  They never once",1,1
"Absolutely horrendous place. The rooms are small, smelly, noisy, nothing works, and the service is plain and simple awful. They just do not care. Had issues with the shower, parking, the bathroom, you name it. Don't bother complaining since the staff simply doesn't care. Didn't have hot water in the shower in the morning, no cream and sugar for 4 days during my stay and if you call the reception, you're told that they have no one in the building to bring it. To make things worse, the majority of rooms face the exterior AC units of other rooms so that's all you can hear at night. Cannot get a good night sleep at this horrific nightmare of a so called hotel. Will never never return to this awful place.",1,1
"Worst hotel experience ever!  Rooms had no a/c.  Hotel pool has been broken for a year, even though it is advertised as a rooftop pool hotel.  Housekeeping is non-existent.  Rooms are dirty and moldy.  My room sounded like I was sitting on an airport runway with a 747.",1,1
"The location of the hotel is great, subway is easy to get to. However the hotel itself wasn't so great. The pool was closed- this was the only reason we booked this hotel. Rooms aren't very big, wifi is $10 a day. The room didn't have any of the things you'd expect like a pen and paper, a guide to the hotel/city, air con control (it's either really cold or nothing) and there was a coffee maker and no milk. When we first arrived we tried to phone reception/concierge and never got an answer.  The reception area and bar and very opulent and beautiful and the rooftop bar is great to view the city. But they don't make up for what the hotel is lacking!",2,1
I stayed 6 nights. I ended up staying in two rooms due to issues. I stayed in a room with double beds and one with a king bed. Different floors...different views. The room facing 63rd had great views but also had street noise. The room facing inside walls was quiet but drab.   The rooms weren't too bad other than the rotting bathroom door and the spots on the mirrors (bathroom and sleeping area). I was concerned about the cleanliness of the towels after picking one up that smelled of body odor--private parts. Both rooms air conditioner barely worked. I tried calling the front desk and the phone just rang. I tried 3 more times before anyone answered. (I wasn't calling during check-in or check-out times either).  I had to request a box fan in order to sleep and I'm not a person,2,1
"We stayed here for a mother/daughter weekend and were disgusted by our experience. Our room was not ready for check-in until close to 4pm (check-in is at 3pm). Once we finally got to our room, the light was broken, the sink was clogged, and the a/c wasn't working. Additionally, the shower was designed without a door so the whole bathroom gets wet when you shower. After discussing our situation with management, we were given a small desk fan to cool the room and towels for the flooded bathroom floor. To add insult to injury, the pool is closed indefinitely due structural damage. They refused to discount our stay. Most disappointing and unpleasant stay...we will not be returning.",1,1
"Awful hotel and horrible experience The pool leaded, the shower poured out on the floor, the power went out, the AC was outgunned by the weather, the decor was old, beat up and tired, just awful in every respect.",1,1
"Stayed here 3 days, 2 nights on business so the hotel selection was not my own.  Pros: -great location and on its own section of W64th so very easy to load in and out of car services  -there was a leak at the pool which affected some guest rooms and the hotel staff made accommodations for those displaced at neighboring hotels and paid for their taxi -modern decor, decent sized rooms and comfy beds -provided high-end complimentary shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc and even had a complimentary toothbrush kit -view from the rooftop at sunset was exceptional   Cons: -AC in the room wasn't working, clearly the coils were dirty and they were frozen and so it was 1. Leaking onto the carpet and 2. Really warm in the room (85F outside). I informed the front desk and they said ""they'd",2,1
"This hotel needs a health warning due to the noise generated by the ventilation plant in the internal cores of the building. The lower the floor the worse the noise, I complained at 2.30 am on my first night and was moved to a lower spec room the next day which was 5 floors higher as this was the only room available. This still was unbearable and on the day of checkout I left at 7am to escape the noise after trying to sleep with noise cancellation headphones on. I think I managed to get less than 10 hours broken sleep in 3 days. The reception staff are polite but there is nothing they can do as the problem is out of their control, they just have to take the complaints as I heard a number of other guests having similar conversations with them. My complaints were registered",1,1
"We stayed at the Empire Hotel for our babymoon/anniversary and were incredibly disappointed. We booked the hotel because of the rooftop pool and were never made aware it was closed (indefinitely) for maintenance. No one told us upon check in, and we were never told upon booking. So disappointing. Although at this point I was very nice about it, because things happen and it's not necessarily the managers fault. Night 2. My husband and I are awoken to a flood in our room, coming from the bathroom ceiling. It took almost two hours for maintenance and housekeeping to deal with the issue and get our bathroom cleaned up. Meanwhile their only solution was to move us to another room. Mind you I am pregnant, and was asleep, and IT WAS MIDNIGHT. I refused to move rooms because we were",1,1
"The room was worse for wear but worse of all I was unable to sleep due to the noise caused by some air con or ventilation units outside the window. The noise was there day and night, but at night was unbearable. Ear plugs were provided in the room that some what drown out the sound but not enough to get a good nights sleep. I would not stay here again.",2,1
"I used to love this hotel and it was my safe choice to stay and recommend to others in NYC but my last stay was a complete disaster. Out of 6 nights our room was served twice, yes, that is true. I even called front desk to make sure that my room was going to be served after the first night it wasn´t and the response from a cynical attendent was "" Do you want your room to be served every day?"" Guess what ? No service on the following 3 nights. I had to go to the reception by myself to grab some toilet paper.  The pool was not operating, they should let the guess know before booking, fitness center not operating but they had a good arragement with a NYSC a couple blocks away.  If you want a smooth stay in NYC, for now you should think twice before booking.",1,1
"Staying at Empire is like being thrown in a pinball! New York tempo up into your room!  Earplugs (provided by the hotel) are not enough, helmet with noise reduction is rather to be considered. The USP is the roof terrasse with the pool...not open ""for safety reason""! What! in summer! Is there a crocodile in there? Room was clean when they do not forget to do it.",1,1
This was my third extended stay at the hotel. The quality of service was drastically diminished. Room was not cleaned on a daily basis. Towels had to be requested. Bathroom had a strong sewer smell as a result of poorly draining shower. The mirror that should have been hanging in the sleeping area was missing with only the bracket left hanging on the wall.,1,1
"I expected more for the price.   No doors on either shower and we had a Deluxe King and a Suite.  Pool was closed for maintenance indefinitely however, we were not advised of this before check in and the rooftop pool was one of the reasons we chose Empire.",2,1
"Checking in and out too lengthy. Front desk not knowledgeable. Second time for an institute. Won't stay again. Location is close to many options for shopping, eating, and entertainment but because the quality of device was so poor, wasn't worth it.",2,1
"Was extremely disappointed with the service as multiple requests to fix AC were IGNORED.  Room was 90 degrees inside and maid service was UNAVAILABLE one day.  Had a pleasant stay here previously, but service has gone downhill.",1,1
"First of all, THANK YOU to everyone's that's left a review for the Empire Hotel during the period of July 8th to July 14th, 2017.  We felt a LOT better knowing that we weren't the only one's having a rough go of it!  For those of you that left a complimentary review during this same period ... are you sure you have the right hotel?!  I will agree with most everyone that this hotel is situated in a great location (Lincoln Center, Columbus Circle, easy access to subways, Broadway Ave, restaurants, etc.).  This made it very nice, because we really didn't want to hang out at the hotel.  I will also give a shout-out to the bell-men, who I also agree were the best folks to work with at the hotel.  These 2 items pretty much wrap up my positive comments.  I feel somewhat compelled to",1,1
Small tatty room. Noisy air conditioning unit. Very noisy unit/vent out side window. missing plugs in bathroom.  View of brick wall from room window. Unhelpful receptionists. Hotel in good central location,2,1
"First Time in NY with my daughter.... nice lobby but very very tiny bedroom, bathroom worst.... swimming pool out of order, big disappointment for us hoping to rest after long walk in the city... tray still in the corridor .... good location",2,1
our stay this time was pretty awful.  The room wasn't cleaned or serviced at all during our 3 day stay.  The housekeeping staff was rude when I asked for extra blanket and pillow- which took one hour to arrive.  Housekeeping hung up on me when I asked if they could bring extra towels quickly after they didn't service room.,1,1
Just really wasn't anywhere near as nice as advertised. Should have had a Queen room and was given a Full. Shower design is hilarious; water everywhere. Tiny room. Did not feel as if the room was very clean. Pre-paid for wireless internet that didn't really work.,2,1
"Awful room. Awful service. Nothing nice about this  hotel. Way too expensive. I've stayed in plenty of hotels round the world,and this is without the worst. Lessons learnt. And I would have given zero rating but couldn't.",1,1
"2 recent nights spent at the Empire have been very disappointing. Here are the bad bits: - Rooms are shabby and in desperate need of updating (Ignore the promotional photo, think Super8 meets The Shining) - The deadlock was broken and the security chain was hanging off the screws. This lead to two completely sleepless nights, due to every sound in the corridor feeling like a threat. A complaint to the management resulted in absolutely no action whatsoever, which is unforgivable for a woman traveling alone.  - A leaking shower meant that the bathroom turned into a swimming pool (and with no housekeeping for 2 days or bathroom ventilation - well draw your own conclusions in the NY summer)  It wasn't all bad: The location is great and the bed was comfortable. Obviously the location",2,1
"Have never experienced such a poor service. Were told that making the beds were not a part of the cleaning and the cleaning personel did not even enter our room to remove carbage or provide clean towels for four days.  Moreover, the pool was closed for a longer period, without warning or anything. I do not know why the personel was there. It was NOT to provide even the basic service expected from a hotel in this price range.",1,1
"Bellmen were the best service on property. And typically they are contracted out so guessing they aren't even hotel employees. Gave me key to room that was wrong room and had guests clothes and messy beds to start. Got new room facing and didn't come with a bed sheet. Rooms were ok, upper deck patio is nice. Bar staff there was accommodating. Wouldn't stay here again. Rarely write bad reviews, but it just didn't meet expectations for $400.",2,1
"This has been the worst hotel experience I've ever had. This is also the first negative review I've ever written. I only booked this hotel for the pool they advertise on their website. The pool was closed indefinitely and they never mentioned that on their website. To make up for the pool being closed they gave me free internet...the internet doesn't work! They also upgraded my room...the rooms A/C is incredibly old and the engineer said it really doesn't work. The manager initially offered me free breakfast to make up for the experience. This 4 star hotel is an insult to 2 star hotels. UPDATE. Literally, as I was writing this review the hotel delivered a fan to my room because my A/C doesn't work. It took them 30 minutes to deliver the fan and IT DIDN'T WORK. Words can't",1,1
"The hotel is a few minutes walk from Central Park, Lincoln Center, subway access, and more, which is awesome.  Starbucks and Walgreens are right next door.  However, I have never had worse service in my life, and I've traveled a lot across many countries.  My family had 3 separate rooms, and since they have no ice machines, we all called more than 5 times and never received ice.  They told us before coming that there was an in-room fridge and coffee.  There's a Keurig and pods, but we had no cups and never any cream, sugar, or stir sticks.  2 days in a row our room was not made up, even after telling them after the first day.  1 day my sister's room wasn't as well as my parents'!  The gym was being renovated the entire time, and they had passes to a gym, but since I have little",2,1
Pool closed on 88 degree sunny day and no service! Front desk said rainy day.  I regret spending the money on this hotel. We always stay at the Hilton Midtown but wanted to try something but made a mistake.,2,1
"Don't do it to yourself. You will be highly disappointed if you stay here. It is a very out dated hotel. Poor AC, no shower doors (so the entire floor gets wet). No ice machines...poor customer service",1,1
"This hotel takes great pictures but is not at all what it looks like in person. Room is very small.  There is only 1 door on the shower which puts water all over the floor, not to mention you can not go into the bathroom without going to shower to close the door.  Lastly, I was here with 5 employees and they all had their own room and we each got an apology letter for not cleaning the room on different days.  See example below.   Also felt this hotel may have been a hotel for one night stands.",2,1
"Dirty room Room not ready No cleaning done No room service Bed creaked Small small room This was the 5th time we have stayed at Empire, never had an issue until this visit. I will not stay there again",1,1
"We booked the empire as it looked great in the pictures, the pool looked inviting and the reviews were mostly good. The location was excellent, very close to Central Park and Times Squarw. Unfortunately the first room we were allocated had an AC that sounded like a freight train and wet carpet surrounding it. It was also extremely dark as it was an internal room with a view of walls. I was unable to contact reception by phone as it was constantly busy. At reception we were not immediately offered another room and it took another visit to reception after waiting half an hour for an engineer that didn't arrive to be offered the opportunity to move. The second room was adequate although also extremely dark. There were also no facilities to make tea or coffee which I would have",2,1
"Firstly, the pool and gym are not available to guests due to maintenance work. My room is REALLY loud from two large pipes that are outside my window (one on each side)  which must power the electricity for the whole hotel. I asked to move rooms, none available and the Manager didn't seem to care nor want to help in any way. I am part of a group, so I was told that a room change would need to go through sales tomorrow but I'm unsure why when all I need is a room to sleep, I'm not asking for an upgrade or a better room I just want one where it doesn't feel like an aeroplane is landing in my room. The website says ""either city view or quiet courtyard"" have a look at my photos are tell me that looks like a courtyard!! As I enter the room, I'm right up the end of the hallway, there",1,1
"The Empire Hotel  looks great on paper. The lounge and reception are still decked out identically to their starring role days in 'Gossip Girl'. But, even here the edges are looking a bit frayed and shabby. The room was fine and clean enough although there were some stains here and there and bathroom not pristine. No complimentary tea or coffee; you have to pay per cup for this. The rooftop pool was decidedly grubby and closed early when we were there. The lift to this floor was also broken. We got a bargain price for our room on a website and so did not feel short changed. If you're paying full price then I would expect you'll be disappointed. In its favour, the hotel is handy for Central Park and the Kennedy Centre.",2,1
"Staff and housekeeping overwhelmed, disorganized, small room, cold, small pool.  Didn't have room ready, housekeeping in room at 930pm one night.  Had to tell front desk what was taken out of mini bar open checkout?!  Keep track of that stuff yourself!",2,1
"Empire Hotel looks fabulous however am very disappointed with customer service -my sister and her family were due to stay here for 1 week at end of June however her husband was taken ill suddenly due to sepsis and was taken to intensive care where he remains critically ill - I contacted Empire on her behalf to cancel and were promised a refund or transfer , however the hotel has not returned any of out contacts .Please have some compassion for this lovely family and reply to our  emails - The family would love to visit once Mr Grieve has recovered and their 11 year old is heartbroken",2,1
Good if you are barely using your room. Very outdated. Needs a lot of work. Beautiful when you first walk in though.  Rooms are tiny. Had to switch rooms at check in because the deadbolt was busted off.,2,1
I just made my check in. I went to my room and when I was going down I got stucked in the elevator during 30 mnts and the guy behind the phone in the elevator was rude and didn't tell us any information about the help that they was providing. We had to call 911 ant the fire department came. That was too bad and the manager just sent to my room a bottle of champagne but my wasted time and my health they didn't care about that. They had to give a free night at least. Bad experience in those elevators.,2,1
"Poorly designed, tiny tiny bathroom with no ventilation for the steam from the shower causing the whole room to become dewy. Room was hot, the ac was on but didn't work very well. We also found a roach in the shower. We are pretty laid back people so, this is not satire just honesty. The staff was friendly.",2,1
"Stayed on a holiday weekend~ Hotel was very crowded (sold out according to staff) and understaffed for housekeeping (told this by front desk staff & house keeping staff we were able to track down in halls. Room was not ready at 7pm when we checked in. A bunch of 'excuses' followed by being originally put into a smaller room than promised. After multiple complaints~ upgraded to a Jr Suite- which would have been wonderful, except the AC unit didn't work properly, room was joy properly stocked, housekeeping never came to service and repair person (for AC) never arrived either. Also~ rooftop pool was cloudy with no towels available each time I used it.",2,1
"The rooms desperately need money spent on them to bring them up to an acceptable standard for the cost.  The air con is old, very noisy and inefficient.  The tiles in the bathroom were cracked in several places, the enamel on the bath heavily chipped and paint peeling off the door.  It turned out the advertised complimentary wi-fi is only available in the lobby, that should be made clear.  The charges for the wi-fi in the room was ridiculously high at $10 per day.  We won't be returning.",1,1
"I would never stay in this hotel again ever. I forgot my iPod in my room when I checked out to catch a flight, I tried for days to get through to the hotel but was unsuccessful, on hold for over 30 mins each time, emails went unanswered for days also. When I did eventually get through to someone, they literally could not have cared less, "" no iPod was handed in"" end of story is what I was told.  Drinks in the hotel are over priced €16 for a glass of white wine. The room was fine, very small but I expected that, the price of snacks from the mini bar is also overpriced.  One good point was the location, it's within walking distance to the main tourist spots.",2,1
"I entered a TripAdvisor review through the hotel feedback system, but they did not permit it to be entered--I suspect they are repressing many of the reviews from last week.  Let me say what happened: 1) a complete power outage for 17 hours, resulting in no lights and no water (no flushing toilets, no showers), 2) pitch black hallways with no emergency lighting, and stairways with no emergency lighting (pitch black), 3) people walking down 11 flights of stairs, in the dark, with heavy suitcases, 4) could not contact the hotel staff, because the phones didn't work, 5) no housecleaning, obviously, 6) before the power went out, a water leak that threatened to cave in our bathroom ceiling, forcing us to change rooms, 7) faulty air conditioning, leaving it 90 degrees in our room the",1,1
"Dark, dismal hotel. Needs a complete refurbish....stuck in the 60's with brown wallpaper, brown carpets. old, brown furniture and poor lighting. Frequent queues at the reception. Concierge and house keeping very pleasant. No wifi except in lobby ....barbaric in this day and age.",2,1
"We booked this hotel to stay closer to Central Park and away from the time square crush, whilst visiting NYC for a week. Excellent location as subway was little over 5 mins walk away.   We had a junior suite and as staying a week free wifi. Room was freshly decorated and of a good size especially for a NYC hotel.  Bathroom looked slightly tired but clean and decent amounts of hot water.  Staff were friendly and until the total power failure in the early hours of Saturday 24th June, we had really enjoyed our stay.   What happened was beyond the control of the staff, so no point it getting irate. On check out our contact details were taken with a promise to contact me with a refund for the last night and a statement of account.  Alas 2 emails and 4 days later, I have heard nothing",2,1
"We are a family from Massachusetts, and spend a night or two in Manhattan 2-3 times a year.  We always look for a room that can fit 4 or 5, has a central location, is in a 3-4 star hotel, and is in the same price range.  The room that we had at Empire hotel was smaller than any other we have used in the last 5 years, in some cases, less than half the size.  The beds were tiny as well- not queen, not full, but double.  The shower has the half glass enclosure, which was fine with me, but my kids spilled water everywhere. The room was clean enough. The breakfast was excellent, and overall cheaper than what we would have paid going to a restaurant/ cafe near by. The rooftop bar has amazing views and ambiance.  The pool is tiny (must be 5 ft by 15-20 feet at the most). The young man",2,1
Our room was so small we could hardly move in it. It was the smallest hotel room we have ever stayed in - over 60 years.  The location of the hotel is excellent but because the room was so small we did nothing but slept there.,1,1
"very disappointed to they charge for wi-fi for every phone plus ask for extra coffee, if we get out of the street most of the places wi-fi free and friendly , for the price this hotel charge $330 p/n too expensive",2,1
"The hotel staff was ill equipped to handle an emergency that left the hotel without power and water. Communication was absent as we woke up to complete darkness. There were no attempts to relocate guests to other properties. The hotel management represented that they would reach out to guests and refund the stay, however I have yet to hear from them.",1,1
I can confirm the power/water incident this weekend. I am saddened and disturbed that the hotel has yet to respond publicly to the safety concerns that multiple reviews mention. Could have been tragic outcomes.  Would not feel comfortable/safe returning to the Empire.,1,1
"Our family of 4 stayed for 3 nights at Empire hotel. On the 3rd night, the hotel had an electrical problem and lost power in the middle of the night. With the elevators not working, and fire trucks in front of the hotel, an announcement was made at 1:00am telling guests that there was an electrical problem but not to worry. We followed other guests down 8 flights of stairs only to wait in the lobby for another hour before we were told we could return to our rooms via the stairs. We returned to a room without power or water. The power was still out in the morning and with no working washrooms, we left as soon as possible. I was told at the front desk that the hotel would follow up when I asked for a refund for the night's stay but I have yet to receive a reply to my emails. The",1,1
"I was there as part of a wedding party, and there was no running water or electricity. I was on the 11th floor.  I had to walk up and down the stairs 4 times!!!!!  People were passing out in the pitch dark, boiling stairwell.  The lobby looked like a refugee camp, people huddled around generators trying to charge their phones.  And, although the hotel claimed they weren't responsible for the grid shutting down, they should have been better prepared for the inevitability of everyone checking out.  He tried to charge us for the room!!!!  He asked if we ""needed a recipe"" and when I protested, he admitted he couldn't even give us a recipt as the system was still down.  Um, ok?  So why did you ask us if we needed one?  Apparently the manager is going to call everyone and ""sort this",1,1
"This was our 3rd stay at The Empire, its previously provided a convenient location, even if the rooms are small.  As reported by others an incident happened shortly after midnight on Fri 23rd June, resulting in the Security Director making confusing and conflicting announcements. Was there a fire, was it necessary to evacutate?? Not clear to us , nor others gathering in corridors to try to decipher what was being said in ever louder announcements.  We took the emergency staircase to exit the hotel, just in case.  The stairwell was in total darkness, no power, no emergency lighting, lots of people using phones as the only lighting. Total confusion amongst guests as to what was happening.  After milling around outside with no further information we returned to our room and heard",1,1
"Just wasn't what they sold me on, too small of a room, no a/c. And the pool area looked like a run down show. Whole place needs to be redone I was in line to check in for about an hour and a half and still had to wait. Not a good stay",1,1
"This hotel has great trimming but underneath it leaves much to be desired.  The rooms and bathrooms are SMALL, the amenities are lacking and the up keep hasn't been kept up. Looking for a plug for your phone you'll look all over, and there is NO counter space anywhere. For the money you are paying go to another hotel.",1,1
"I am not someone who writes bad reviews, in fact I am probably tolerant to a fault, HOWEVER: You may have read about the blackout last night.  Certainly not the hotel's fault, BUT, when the safety director sounded panicked over the loudspeaker, telling guests every minute or two for a half hour, something along the lines of, ""The fire department is here, there is a situation, the elevators are down, they are investigating, stay in your rooms,"" it didn't instill much confidence that we were safe.  Throw in a few announcements such as ""folks in the lobby, please go outside if you need air"" just made things more confusing and uncomfortable, especially for those of us on a high floor.   Why couldn't they just say that there was no fire, everyone was safe and the situation was just a",1,1

The staff didn't give any info now are 10 am already pass 11 hours and . Many guests already left and the most incredible is they want to charge last time. If you are in the Jail you can use the bathroom and you have electricity and light. New York Empire Hotel don have electric generator incredible all the reader have to read before came . Disaster. Be fare and aware from this place!!!!!!!!",1,1
"The worst hotel!!! Now, I am inside hotel 10th floor and no electricity more than 4 hours already. I cannot contact anyone no telephone work, no electricity and no water!!! The most Terrible hotel that I had been in my life. Even I called from my mobile but no reception to pick call. Why you don't tell the guest what is going on? How long I have to wait!!! I want to go to toilet but no water. I didn't take shower and now inside the room is very hot.  Unbelievable!! When I came back from outside, no maid clean or make up the room but I put the signboard in front of the door to request make up room. But she came and give me only 3 cups for coffee!!!

"Here is the thing, if this was a lousy bangkok hotel for 30/night, then I would understand.  At this price point well....half the things in our room were broken.  The shower has no door, so after 3 min of use, you can go swimming by the toilet.  Yes I have seen that before (like in Europe), but in the USA, where the bathroom is big enough for a sliding door, just being cheap? Also, some lower rooms are so loud next to AC machines outside??..that there is no peace or quiet.  Literally had to convince myself the noise was anything else to somehow accept it...the loudest hotel room I have ever stayed in, and I have been around.  Just do yourself a favor and find another place. I easily take sleeping on a bamboo house raft again with no ac, sleep on the floor with ants crawling on",1,1
"It was more my emotion to stay at the gossip girl hotel than what is the hotel. The prices are excessive for the size of the room. They sell you up bottles of water, the price of wifi is excessive. The location of the hotel is perfect, close to any place you want to visit in NY.  The staff very friendly and the cleaning also perfect. A day earlier I stayed in a much cheaper hotel and it was much better than the empire hotel.",2,1
"Not a good experience.  This could be a 4-star hotel but not close.  No Wifi service.  No help.  No one answers the phone.  Not the Operator....not the front desk.  The phones just ring and ring and then you get put on hold.  Terrible responsiveness / front desk service.  Air conditioning is hard to control because the old units sit behind massive, thick curtains.  And for goodness sakes, when are you going to fix the EMPIRE HOTEL lights on the top of your building?",2,1
"Smelly room, old noisy aircon, shower wasnt working properly, There was no wifi in room unless you pay 10$  for day or go and  sit down in lobey, Reception was very helpful and kind, well the location was just great.",2,1
Beds very uncomfortable  temperature in room too hot the bathroom too small and rate of the room increased soon after confirming .Staff pleasent  but I'm still waiting for ice to b delivered. Nice location but for the price not worth staying again.,1,1
"The hotel feels nice, but the room that was given to us (141) was extremely small and oddly shaped. There was not even space for a bin. Should be transformed into a storage space rather than used for guests.",1,1
"I was enticed to pay more for this room than I normally would because of the rooftop bar and pool.  Unfortunately, the bar can apparently be closed to guests at anytime at ""the boss's"" discretion.  The pool was being ""maintenanced"" during my stay, so that was out as well.  The room was nice, despite the oddly designed half of a shower door that unavoidably results in water all over the bathroom floor.",2,1
"I was a guest at the Empire Hotel in New York about a week ago and I can honestly say: NEVER AGAIN! There were several issues with my room that I was extremely unhappy with and which I addressed right at the first night at the Hotel but I did not receive any help from the staff. I asked to speak with a Manager in charge more than once and they found excuses for me not to talk to someone. The room I was staying in had bugs all over the place, in my bed, my bathroom, on the window shelfs, my desk, etc. They were everywhere! The room itself was small, VERY dirty and old. The tiles in the bathroom were  coming off the wall, coding on walls and doors were coming off, etc. My sheets were also dirty and even though I asked for them to get changed, that did not happen.  I booked a king",1,1
"Very upset that the pool was closed due to rain earlier in the day...but no rain was falling in the evening when we wanted to use it.  Everything else was fine, but for the money I spent, I wanted to at least be informed of the closure rather then going up to the pool to find a locked door",2,1
Air conditioner was not plugged in. No room service menu. Card Keys did not work. Not given WiFi access code.  No drinking glasses. Deluxe King Room tiny and no closet space. Great location. Terrible service.,1,1
"The room maintenance was poor. The coffee supplies were never replaced. The shower design wets or damps the bathroom floor. The plumbing was defective: the toilet got clogged twice and we NEVER threw anything but toilet paper in it. The furniture was poor. There wasn't a proper closet or wardrobe. When you are charged more than four hundred dollars a day, you expect something at least REGULAR!  The best of the hotel is its location. The room was under average if furniture is considered.  Besides amenities and supply of coffee and sugar were poor or inexistent. The doormen are very friendly, I think the best personnel in this hotel. The internet connection is a rip off. You cannot charge your clients ten dollars a day per device when most of hotels are offering free high quality",2,1
This hotel should be condemned if this is what any of their other rooms are like. The bathroom door was rotted. Zero water pressure in the sink. Small bugs too. Zero light in my room. 109 look for yourself. Loud AC unit outside of my window to nothing. Condemned is my recommendation.,1,1
"We stayed at this hotel while visiting NYC for a weekend family event. The hotel is in a good location near Lincoln Center and Columbus Circle.   The lobby is dark but comfortable. Our toilet did not flush, even after it was ""fixed"". The shower was awkward to turn on. The room curtains were stained. And, we were informed by someone at the front desk that if we wanted two regular coffee pods (rather than the standard supply of one regular and one decaf) we would need to pay an extra charge. Really?!?! Upon checking out we were given $50 reduction to our room charge due to a non functioning toilet. Will not be returning anytime soon.",2,1
Hotel is in a good location and the overall hotel is nice.  There was no water for two days and the desk would not answer the phone.  There are many other options that are better.  We were a bit disappointed.,2,1
"I stayed 4 nights at Empire Hotel. The interior is gorgeous and location is top-notch. I loved going up to the rooftop bar, because the view was lovely. The food up there was excellent minus the drinks, but the manager was very accommodating and tirelessly tried to find me a cocktail I would enjoy, and she did just that, so the customer service was excellent.   I was very disappointed in the noise level of my neighbors and how hard the mattress was in my room. I developed lower back pain and shoulder pain. I don't believe the caliber of a 4 star hotel should have such sub-par mattresses considering the amount of money I'm spending just to be there.",2,1
Hotel is very old. Air conditioning/heat was unacceptable. Internet was difficultcult to activate and we had to call the help line to activate. The wine selection by the glass was limited to 1 and the cost was not justified.,1,1
"We expected a lot from this hotel given how it sells itself online, but we're really disappointed.   The let down started on arrival when we were greeted at the front desk by a lady who was rude and quite frankly, didn't want to be there.   She put us on the first floor which I asked to be moved due to the noise (this was mentioned in the booking) so she put us next to an elevator on the 9th floor..... she was clearly having a good day.  The rooms are way too small, even for a New York hotel.   The hotel clearly needs new air conditioners. We had friends staying in another room and both of us had issues. Ours continued to switch itself off and then not turn back on. We called the front desk atleast for times over two days and unfortunately it took me going down personally for",1,1
The grout wasn't clean but the location of the hotel was great. The rooms are smaller than I'm accustomed to in Arkansas. There is a restaurant and bar on site which is great. Did visit the rooftop and it was a great view of the city.,2,1
"I booked what I believed to be a suitable room for a lot of money for a 7 night stay. It was a shoebox, with a window that looked straight onto a brick wall, no light, and no where to even put down our suitcases. The bathroom required scraping your side against the door edge to get in or out. We had to step over our suitcase to get to the bed. It turns out it was an ""express room"".... I did not know this until we arrived. Couldn't someone have mentioned that this is not appropriate for a 7 night stay? We had to spend a whole lot more money upgrading it after 2 awful nights in this terrible room. Had I known that I would have stayed eksewhere. The staff never smile and the atmosphere overall is not really pleasant. I would never go back.",1,1
Not worth the price!  Hotel staff only accommodated a change of rooms.  They made no effort to apologize for poor conditions which leads me to believe they are well aware of the situations.  Juilliard should be aware since they made the original referral.,1,1
"Forget it if you are a business woman expecting minimal respect. I made a reservation in my name, with my credit card, and listed my husband, with a different last name as a guest in the room. My name was canceled from the reservation, and reservations communicated with him, only, under my email address no less.",2,1
"Overall the hotel is in a great location, however the quality of the room was very low, run down, and dated.  Bedding and pillows were very low quality and uncomfortable.  Some of the hotel staff were very polite and offered great service while others were terrible, and were actually rude.",2,1
"Very disappointed that for 2 days in a row, my shower trickled with cold water only.  Hotel tried to repair but took long time and my plans did not allow me to wait.  If not for this inconvenience, I would've had an excellent stay.",2,1
"My ""quiet room on the Courtyard"" was on the 2nd floor, facing into the grey dirty air shafts...... My lamps were so low I couldn't read in the daytime! Management told me: "" you could remove the shades"" ❗️ Housekeeping, MONIKA, was GREAT 🎈   She got me a floor lamp (which though had a mind of it's own, suddenly coming on in the middle of the night). She provided a man who installed the missing plug for bathroom sink, and explained VERY complicated shower, although he couldn't fix shower nozzle which hung lose from ceiling, or why shower enclosure went only halfway across opening, guaranteeing water flooding floor... Mini fridg filled with things for sale, along with tray on desk with MORE wine etc ... At check out I was charged $6.00 (later removed) for ""EXTRA coffee""  because",2,1
"Excellent staff, particularly Maggie at Front Desk and bell service staff. Room aircon was very loud when temperature control was set at a comfortable level. Noisy hallway conversations and doors banging.",1,1
"Internet is 12$ a day where you can find other hotels with free with five.  The hotel is old, the rooms are very small like a shoe  box. Highly  recomend  not to go.  There is a bed smell at the room from the shower and the air conditioning system is very old.",1,1
"My mother and I stayed at your hotel due to the proximity to Central Park.  I ran the half marathon in the park on April 30th.  We had many issues while staying at the Empire Hotel.  When we attempted to check our bags on Saturday, April 29th, the bag attendant was rude and dismissive.  He snapped at us when we didn't do we needed to check our bags together.  When we arrived, the front desk told us there was happy hour on the roof on the weekends.  After ordering our drinks upstairs, they told us there was no happy hour there on the weekends.  They told us there was one in the bar.  We went to the bar.  They told us there was never a happy hour there.  It took us 30 minutes to get to the roof.  We tried to access it through our room multiple times and kept trying to get to the",2,1
"We stayed here as it was an 18th birthday treat for my daughter as she's a big Gossip Girl TV show fan. It was her first trip to New York and we'd flown from the UK so were looking forward to our first night's sleep.  The room we were given was an absolute disgrace. The toilet handle was hanging off, there was no instructions on how to do anything in the room such as cooling or heating and the ""style"" of the hotel is clearly dark and dingy because there were just 2 side lights for the entire room which meant your could hardly see a thing.  To be honest, the lights were the least of our problems. We didn't sleep a wink the first night as our room had EVERY noise polution problem you could possibly have. It had huge generators right outside the windows that were as noisy as being",2,1
"Find somewhere else to stay.  Other than the location and hotel history this is a property to avoid.  I was a resort manager and found this property to be very poorly run in virtually every area.   Espically the AC / vent system was poor, the heater not adjustable, the system noise very high.  The rooms were very small with cracks in the bathroom.  Everything was old and in only fair condition if not poor condition.",1,1
"I recently stayed at The Empire Hotel while I was running a training nearby.  If you’ve gone to Lincoln Center before, you’ve walked by this hotel! It’s a great location, very easy to get to from a lot of things.  The experience I’ll detail below is atypical and much of what it was out of control of the hotel’s staff. There was an explosion/fire in the basement that caused power to go out and alarms to go off.    I’ll first comment on my general experience outside of the incident.  The hallways had a funky vibe with an interesting picture frame wallpaper.  The room was nice, it was mostly well designed with a decent amount of space for a hotel in NYC.  I had one queen size bed, with a work desk and a bench to put your suitcase.  There was a mini bar and a tray of goodies on the",2,1
Location for the Lincoln Center could not be better and the public areas are stylish and fun; but the room is incredibly noisy (from the machinery under the window- see pic). I don't mind the horrible view but I really hate the constant loud noise which continues throughout the night too. The bathroom door looks like someone tried to kick it in and they didn't repair it and the shower is a bit mouldy. I tried to ring down to reception last night when I arrived to ask if there was any chance of a quieter room but no one answered the phone and I was really exhausted after a transatlantic flight so I just gave in and accepted it. I certainly wouldn't book this place if I had a choice and I wouldn't dream of bringing someone if I wanted a romantic weekend in NY!!,2,1
"location is fabulous if you are going to Lincoln Center. But it does not obviate the problems with electronics (electrical outlets don't work), room amenities (coffee machine does not work) and bell hops who have to be called upon by hotel guests to come and find taxis. Really, can this be true? Holy smokes, this hotel has gone down hill over the years. We have been coming here for years to be close to the Met opera. Forget it. We will find another place to stay.",2,1
"as stated,this experience was sufficiently poor to stop me from ever booking at this hotel in the future and to make sure I tell all my friends what a terrible situation we were faced with.  We have stayed at the Empire before and although we realized the rooms tend to be small, we were totally unprepared for the disgrace of a room we were given.",2,1
"Myself and 3 friends stayed here for a big 30th celebrations! We couldnt have been more disappointed, after spending a long time looking forward to it.  We had a long journey over from the UK and spent a while getting through immigration and battling the traffic from JFK, so when we arrived we wanted to check in as quickly as possible and just relax. This wasn't meant to be. We were greeted by a member of staff at the front desk who asked me for my ID and a credit card to secure the booking, this was provided but unfortunately the card was not cleared. Instead of trying to find an alternative solution, the service given instantly changed to highly patronising and he made absolutely no attempt to fix our issue. Instead we suggested a solution to the problem which led to him",1,1
"I was pretty let down. I've been by the Empire numerous times and seen it on TV/movies so I decided to splurge a bit and stay.   First impression- front desk staff was tired and over their work day. I get it, it was the end of the night and it was busy. I had to come back down from the 11th floor twice cause my key card wouldn't work. Nothing said expect keep it away from your phone. As i was carrying my purse, carry on and suitcase its safe to say my phone wasn't near the key card I had in my opposite hand. No offer to help me back up either time.  Room small but expected for NYC. Bed was HARD as a ROCK, probably one of the worst I've had in a long time.  Both lamp shades were broken, still functional just looked like crap. Room was fine, phone was so dirty/dusty I didnt want",2,1
"We gave the Empire a try for two nights and were appalled. While the lobby is nice and the staff polite, staying there is not pleasant. Our room was a somewhat shabby hole in the wall with barely enough space to walk between the bed and the wall to what passed for a closet, a niche in the wall with a curtain over it and little space to hang clothes. The promised queen bed was a double, the ventilation varied from nothing (stuffy air) to full blast (loud and clanking through the night, when you got the hotel to get it up and running), but you get little sleep in either case. The bathroom has no space to put anything nor enough room to shut the door from the inside, unless you stand in the shower. Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was chaotic, with no host or hostess to tell you",1,1
"Tiny room, minimal services, and a very unresponsive staff when heat and AC didn't work. When repaired, it made an earsplitting roar that made sleep impossible. Great location -- but not a nice experience at all. Definitely will not return!",1,1
Old Property with maintenance lagging behind. Great location and everything is a extra. poor internet and pricing for extras is huge. Even standard things in other hotels are extras. Bed had exactly one pillow,1,1
"Bad experience at this hotel horrible room with hard mattresses and pillows, extra charges for Internet, expensive food,not view at all from room,very dark hotel I would not recommend it.not a good experience for any member of my family.",1,1
"The rooms are dark and dingy - dark walls, dark curtains, dark flooring. Closet hooks are meant for giants, not those under 5'5"". You need to straddle the toilet to use the personal mirror. Beds were comfy enough. Rooms are super small. Food was not great so plan on eating out. Front check in staff were not engaged or passionate about their jobs.",2,1
"Please take a look at my last review for this hotel. We stayed here again in April 2017, again in a pleasant junior suite. The good news at this stay is that WiFi was included, so my credit card wasn't hacked. Plus, the chambermaids and restaurant staff were all very cordial. However, the same cannot be said for the hotel managers. We had 3 concerns, and the 3 managers we spoke to several times were unhelpful, rushed us and were not listening, did not keep their word or return calls, and were obviously passing the buck to the next one's shift.  1. In the 3 days that we were there, our room keys failed and needed to be replaced 3 times. (No, the keys were not near our cell phones.) On one of these days, due to a power failure the machine that makes these keys wasn't functioning,",2,1
"They had a power failure the night before which extended well into the next booking day.  They could have notified us that there was a problem, rather than telling us that we couldn't check in for hours after arrival.  Once they finally allowed us to check in, they gave us the wrong room.  We had waited for hours to get in, so we just took our lumps and didn't complain until the next day.",2,1
"I stayed here for a business trip. Unfortunately, during my stay the hotel experienced an explosion/fire in the basement that knocked out power. This caused the fire alarm to go off abruptly at 3AM and woke everybody up. We were advised to stay in our rooms. The power going out kicked out my A/C and it never came back on despite me trying to turn it on. There was NO emergency lighting in the stairwells that we all had to use because the power being out took out the elevators. What establishment with ten stories doesn't have emergency lighting in the stairs? Preposterous! There was an occasional employee using the flashlight app on their phones to help guide you down the stairs. The power was out most of Wednesday and we were continually being told ""two hours"" for the power to",2,1
"Location is main draw-- lower class hotel (chintzy in all ways) posing a boutique hotel  but with no perks ..chintzy in supplies as one bar of soap for both sink and shower use.... lacking supplies...seemed as if room had not been used in ages-- dusty and missing much... lack of outlets for charging cell phones, computer, IPad etc.... Lighting terrible",1,1
"Had fire in a transformer, alarms, firefighters, trucks, sirens, anouncements, Hotel was no help. poor communication, atitudes on edge, no appology, they were as flustered as we were. No one in control, was told help was on our floor to jsut ask.  No help in sight, told them this, no help, no offers. Emergency plan didn't exist. Or at least seemed that way.",2,1
"Please read my other two comments. Power was out and no emergency lighting in the stairwells. I had to check out and find a new hotel to get some sleep, as I was woken at 3am with a fire alarm that went on until 3:45-3:50a",1,1
Horrible service;  fire alarm kept going off at 230 am.  The manager on the PA system could not be understood due to his thick accent.  His announcements were very confusing. The concierge was very rude.,1,1
"The location and the rooftop are something that could entice you to stay, the noise, the fire alarms in the middle of the night should deter you.  The rooms are small and in need of some upgrades, the bathrooms in the standard and superior rooms are like a closet with a shower, toilet and skinny sink inserted.  No closet just a small cubby to hang things.  Pack light if you are staying in anything but a junior suite.  The staff was great and the location is excellent for Central Park, Lincoln Center and Columbus Circle.  Easy access to the MTA and very walkable area.",2,1
"there was no door in the shower so it ends up being a mess the AC was not working, very old system, the buttons were all stuck, they gave me a personal heater which was useless there was only 1 person at the front desk for the check out, it took forever to check out for the price you can find something better in the same location",2,1
"Our hvac unit clearly has seen better days, from broken knob to a fan that sounded horrible to the fact that the unit could not cool off the hot room made the space very difficult to sleep in. We stayed two nights and despite very early morning request on the second day, they would not move us as they said they were sold out, I'm sure they had to have a late arrival on Saturday where they could have moved us while attempted a real repair?",2,1
"Location is the only reason to stay here for us. The rooms are overpriced, furniture beat up, draft in window, could not read the warm/cold on dial it was so old and worn out, no hot water one morning, no wash cltohes or coffee. All of this reported to front desk and never heard a peep from management over the course of four day staff. Seem very disinterested",1,1
"BEWARE AND CHECK YOUR CARD TRANSACTIONS We visited this hotel in December and as other hotels gave our credit card as room deposit. Upon returning to England and the arrival of our credit card bill it was noted that the empire hotel had debited our card with $52.26 . We had not used any room facilities or drinks, we paid cash. After two attempts of contacting the hotel we had an apology as an oversight on their side and our card credited. Unfortunately due to exchange rates we are still short from the original amount. Please watch your card statements. As the hotel seem to be slow at responding to e mails AND YOU TOO COULD END OUT OF POCKET",2,1
"I’ve stayed in budget hotels that are better than this 4*  You could forgive the tired and shabbiness of the rooms perhaps if the staff were friendly and accommodating but unfortunately they are as rude and unhelpful as I’ve ever come across.    I pride myself on being a polite and respectful guest – I was in a room that was clearly one of their worsts and I put up with it without complaint for almost the whole week until it became unbearable… the heater was old and to say it was noisy was an understatement – it rattled and growled, cranked and honestly sounded like someone in pain… I’ve never heard anything like it.  They did come to fix it but to be honest I noticed little improvement.  I also had one day where my room was freezing and the heater appeared to have stooped all",1,1
"Hotel manager very abrupt, no friendly mess or eye contact. Staff not helpful. Location was ideal, however a really bad service from staff. Was made to feel intimidated. Considering I had an upgrade on my room to the king suite, the rooms state was terrible",2,1
This hotel is not worth your money! They charge for EVERYTHING-including any extra pods you may need in your room for the Keurig machine. They do not respond to MT requests-I had to pester them three times before ANYTHING was even done. This is a hotel that wants to give the absolute BARE MINIMUM for the money you pay.,1,1
"No room to swing a cat, heating system antiquated and noisy, but good location. Wouldn't recommend this type of room to anyone unless they were travelling alone. Disappointing, and Not quite what you would expect from a US hotel.",2,1
"I was very disappointed with the amenities of the hotel. The bathroom and plumbing were horrible and the heating units were ancient. I really was expecting more for the price paid. We had to change rooms mid-stay because of the poor conditions of the plumbing and the toilet getting clogged, among other things",2,1
Tiny cramped room. Not soundproof at all so could hear guests talking and making noises in the middle of the night. Temperature control is really bad -it was either too cold or woke up sweating. I would definitely choose another hotel instead next time.,2,1
"The hotel looks like it's been done, but you get to the rooms and they have new wallpaper, but the bathroom is so small you can't use it properly.  The carpet is dirty thank goodness I brought my own house slippers.  It's just not clean",1,1
"The location of the hotel is great. The quality of the room is okay. The bathrooms are EXTREMELY small. The closets are VERY DARK, there is no lighting. The floodlights in the hallway and by the elevators are loose and some wires are exposed. Housekeeping does not help you when you need supplies. I had called for some extra shampoo and conditioner, they never came. Not very family friendly. There were rowdy guests who are inconsiderate of other guests.",2,1
"The pillows weren't clean, my face broke out, the AC didnt work, the heat wouldn't come off ,the staff wasn't very helpful. The hotel was far from the main attractions. The internet was horrible......",1,1
"When we arrived to our room, it was probably close to, if not exceeding 90 degrees... I checked the (very old) heating unit and the heat was turned up all the way. So I tuned it to cool and turned down the temp all the way, thinking it would be cool when we returned from our day.  We get back about 7 hours later at 11pm and it was still sweltering. I asked the front desk if there were any other rooms as it was unbearing in ours. They said they were booked, but they would send a mechanic. One of them recommends we try opening a window (it was 20 degrees out and our room was ON broadway, so not an option) Mechanic comes up and can't figure the problem so just turns it off completely. Apparently they don't use AC in winter, because in his words ""it's already cold out"".   The night",1,1
I was very displeased with a security issue and would like to discuss further with hotel management. There was a fight in my hallway 1 evening. I called the front desk and received little comfort and assistance. Same can be said when I checked out the next morning. I was brushed aside quickly. Very disappointing.,1,1
Hotel looks slightly worn and very dark lobby/ bar area. Charges for internet in rooms and minimal drinks pods in rooms- extra at a' nominal 'amount. Good location but noisy and no double glazing in rooms.,2,1
"This hotel was a bad experience.  We were given a room on the 2nd floor, facing Broadway, and it was very  noisy.  The room was also cold and the heater didn't work.  We moved to a different room and then the bed was terrible!  I would not stay here again, even tho the location was what we needed for this trip.",1,1
Heat ceased twice. Had to go to the front desk in person to ask to that the engineer be sent up. On checkout was not asked how was my stay so I volunteered that the heat was inoperative in the room. I was met with a cavalier indifference. Would have thought that they would want the information so that it could be repaired for the next guest.,2,1
"We arrived on Sunday evening excited about a few night stay in the city center. We had expected the hotel and rooms to be smaller than other cities based on common sense and other reviews. this was of course the case and not a problem. The rooms them selves were quite tired and dated, with some areas (such as the bathroom) needing proper repairs and replacement from lack of proper maintenance, not just age, but again that was no major problem and to be expected (would have been great if that wasnt the case though, good job we got a good deal!).  The problems started on the Monday. With suitcases and clothes everywhere, it wasnt the best state for anyone to come in, so we left the 'do not disturb/ no cleaning' sign on the door and went to enjoy our day. around 4pm we came back",1,1
I recently stayed at the Empire Hotel for a staycation in the city via Hotel Tonight.  The hotel is lovely but I couldn't believe the quality of the bed I stayed in. It was honestly rock solid and I woke up every morning in pain. This is coming from a girl who can sleep on the floor of a friend's apartment and be fine so I was genuinely in shock. The room itself was in a bit of a state of disrepair too. I also found out that the room I stayed in was pretty much the same price as the deal I got on Hotel Tonight so it almost felt like Empire was listing it on there for $5 cheaper so people felt they were getting a deal. I was a little disappointed!,2,1
"Queen room very noisy. Outside noise 24/7, sounded like the engine of a plane. Unable to sleep through it. Paid extra for the next 3 nights to upgrade room, slightly better but lots of traffic noise. Windows didn't seal properly and could hear people walking by the hotel even though we were on the 3rd floor.  Good location,  very close to central park and a subway stop. Definitely wouldn't stay here again",2,1
We were disappointed in the empire hotel. Our shower did not work properly. We had to use the hand held part of the shower since the overhead did not work. The breakfast at eds chowder house was insufficient. The display of the food was not filled & looked like leftovers.,2,1
"Brought my girlfriend to New York for Xmas and she asked to stay in the empire due to her fascination with gossip girl! I found the hotel to be very expensive room was quite small an often waiting till the evening for it to be cleaned, breakfast buffet was very expensive with hot options limited! Hotel bar an rooftop are way overpriced! Also wifi price for room is ridiculous luckily it's free in the lobby!! Location is ok about 2km from Times Square which adds up after a few Days walking one positive very close to Central Park, wil return to New York but definitely a different hotel",2,1
"I had booked a surprise for my husband for one night stay at The Empire Hotel for vanentines weekend. I have been to this hotel before for a New Years Eve party which we enjoyed. The lobby area and mezzanine decor looks beautiful. The roof top is also worth checking out!  I was disappointed however  on how small the rooms were. The shower door was dirty. The wallpaper in the bedroom was peeling off, the bed cover was all torn!  We had breakfast the next morning in the restaurant located on the 1st floor. Was very disappointing. For the price they charge for a hot & cold Buffett it really is not worth the price. I believe our bill came to $60.(for scrambled eggs and some potatoes) The food selection was very small and not much food to offer at all. Both the food and coffee were",2,1
"We decided to stay over one night at NYC after the Opera at Lincoln Center.  We picked Empire hotel because it's only about 20 steps from the Metropolitan Opera House.  I reserved a room at Empire Hotel via Hotels.com with their last minute special deal.  So, we checked in around 4pm before our dinner reservation just to drop off a small over-night bag.  We noticed there's no water coming out of the sink.  And, the drape over the window was very dirty with lots of stains.  And, also noticed very old brownish stains on the shower tub (no, it's not the natural color of the tub). But the bed was clean.  We looked at each other and said ""what the heck, it's just for one night"".  So we just decided to over look those things and not to waste our time at front desk to change our room",1,1
"The iconic ""Hotel Empire"" neon lights were out, which was so sad as my favorite show was filmed there. I would have loved to get a photo. We had to move rooms three times. First time, our phone, closet rod was broken (completely missing), and A/C unit was broken. Second time, they were kind enough to upgrade us to a king size bed. This room was wheelchair accessible. That is lovely for a guest who needs those accommodations. For us however, when showering, the water would go all over the bathroom. Soaking our clothes, towels, and making it dangerous to walk around. Not to mention, when the shower water would reach the toilet area it would smell of URINE. So nasty! When I went to see if we could switch, yet again, the manager informed me that they had no additional rooms",2,1
"When we informed the front desk that our heater broke and was leaking , we were NOT offered another room. The room was cold. Maintence came, knocked and walked in before we could answer - I could have easily been changing. We didn't have acplease do not disturb sign. The coffee was not refilled. The ""courtesy wifi"" is slower than molasses.   Also the walls are paper thin. The guests in room next to us were extremely loud at all hours of the night. We could hear them talking about all of the DRUGS they brought. The hallway smelled of marijuana. When the room doors shut they slam way too hard. All of the walls shake.   Any time I attempted to speak to the woman at the front desk she was completely rude.   Over all terrible experience. So disappointed. Huge fan of a show that this",1,1
"Stayed at the Empire Hotel near the Lincoln Centre this weekend.   For a hotel that calls itself the Empire, the service was somewhat Peasant-like.   Had precooked a room on Hotels.com because the rates were great.  When I arrived with my family, the 'standard room' that I was given was the size of a closet, faced the wall and had a heating unit that was broken and wouldn't stop working...felt like I was in a sauna.  So I called and was moved to a different room, at an additional cost of $40.00 USD / night.  Next room was very nice.   I bought some wine for the room to have with dinner on the Saturday.  I called down to see if I could get some wine glasses, as there were none in the room already, even though there was wine for sale in my mini bar and a corkscrew, just in case I",2,1
"Hotel inside was nice, great location. But the second day my luggage was stolen out of my room. Spoke with the security and also filled out a report with the police.  Security looked at the camera's and said the only two people that went in the room was the maid and the mini bar person. Said they didn't see any luggage taken out. I explained to them that it was just a soft carry on bag which is easy to throw under some towels and take out. The bag was closed up so they could not see in it with my night shirt thrown over it.  Funny thing was that were my luggage was my night shirt was folded neatly.  The whole time i was there i was not even offered any compensation for not having my luggage and only had the clothes that i was wearing that had to last me for two more nights.",1,1
This is a good place to stay if you're going to the opera. It had blackout curtains that let us sleep in late.   On the bad side....extremely slow check in. Three people at the counter and only one taking care of guests. Water damaged bathroom because the shower doors have been removed. I guess they were trying to be hip but all the seals for the door were still there so it just looked tacky. At noon plus 30 seconds a housekeeper knocked to tell us we were late checking out.  There are better options in the area. Check them out first.,2,1
I have been going to Empire Hotel for many years. I was extremely disappointed that we got the worst room in the hotel. I don't think I should have to ask for a room away from elevator or on a higher floor.,2,1
the room was insanely hot and there was a dance club above my heard - no joke ---- a real dance club that closed at 2 am! this was not advertised when I booked the room. The staff was fine. Thats all!,1,1
"I stayed in this hotel last December luckily just for one night.  I was not expecting big rooms, new rooms or rose petals on my arrival but at least a little bit of costumer service was what anyone would expect when you pay 370 dollars for one night. We arrived around midday and the room was ready. The guy that checked us in was nice and polite, he asked me for the passport and the credit card. He gave us the keys for the room and that's it . No explication of the area or information about facilities,breakfast time (I did not have it included but I would have bought it if somebody was promoting it )  maps, help with the bags( even If I am perfectly able to carry my luggage but at least  the question could have been nice..)..I don't know something to let you fell welcome.",1,1
"Hotel staff were very nice the room was clean and well appointed -- BUT -- so small my wife and I almost had to climb over the bed to get to the other side -- bathroom is tiny - tiny - tiny ! If you bend over you'll hit the other wall.  Last but not least -- a great location if you're going to the opera !  An old hotel with small rooms, nice staff -  and a scary elevator --- I'll try another hotel next visit.",2,1
The hotel is located perfectly so you can get to upper and downtown within 20min via cab. The reception is nicely decorated but the rating stops there. My room was a Queen size and the website pictures made it look very spacious but quite the opposite.   I travelled in Jan 2017 and the weather in NYC was about 4 degrees Celsius which means the hotel central heating system automated to the outside conditions. It was BOILING in my room and I even had to open the windows to cool the room down. The A/C vent was about 20 years old and it sounded like a dragon awakening when the thing was turned on so I didn't get much sleep.   I didn't use the room service or tried any of the other facilities but I certainly wont be going there again. My friend was upgraded to a double queen room,2,1
"Stayed here for two nights.  Seemed fine on the first night, however, on the second night I was bitten by bed bugs.  Packed up my things and checked out immediately after reporting the situation to the front desk staff.",1,1
"We stayed at the Empire in January 2017. We got an excellent rate, about $1000 for four nights in a (small) junior suite. We wanted proximity to the Metropolitan Opera, and the Empire is very close, easy walking distance and much closer than any other I know of. But as to amenities the hotel is woefully lacking. The room number on our telephone did not match the number on the door, for example. If we wanted something from the front desk, we had to go down and wait in line; only once, out of a dozen times, did the front desk attendant answer a call from the room. The two rooms were disappointingly dark; we needed an additional floor lamp just to read the newspaper. The bathroom sink was about 1.5 inches deep, so water splatters easily. The tub shower has a glass wall covering",2,1
"I have stayed in motels for  $75.00 a night that were many times nicer than this one. The room is tiny, there is no closet space, the bathroom is designed for undersized humans and they charge $10.00 a day for internet access. There is nothing good to say about this hotel. The only thing going for it is location. It is across the street from Lincoln Center. My advice, just find somewhere else to stay.",2,1
"Decent looking hotel across the street from Lincoln Center/Opera House. We stayed there the night after the show, and the convenience was great, especially since it was raining. Overall, cleanliness was good, the bed was comfortable, and the check-in/checkout was quick and smooth. However, a lot of the details I look for in a nice (expensive) hotel were just not there. I tried calling the front desk (both before and during my stay), and a lot of times the phone would just ring and ring, and they wouldn't answer. Location is nice, but traffic started up LOUD at 7:00 AM. Water pressure at the bathroom sink was too high, and the faucet was oriented poorly, so it was awkward to use, and I kept splashing myself with water. One of the lamps had a broken knob. They provided",2,1
Stayed here to visit ABC studios the next morning. As for location from the studio it was perfect. The stay was not great at all. The front desk services were horrible. They act as though they didn't want to help me. The room wasn't the best but would do for one night. The heater/ air conditioner made a loud clanking noise all night which kept us up. That needs to be updated/ fixed as soon as possible. Wasn't impress and probably would not have stay here again.,2,1
"Geez....first night here and absolutely SHOCKED by this tiny burger and fries....$5 iced tea, $10 slice of pie PLUS $5 room delivery fee PLUS 18% ....I'm not cheap by any means but this for what I received is crazy....  after a long day of traveling I just wanted to eat and relax... I'll be dining out for the remainder of my stay....",1,1
"First off the hotel was in an amazing location for the price that we paid. It has a beautiful lobby and the doormen are very friendly and helpful. That's all of the nice things I have to say about the stay. Upon checking in at 7pm on a Wednesday there were 4 staff members at the front desk, not including the concierge. We stood there as they peaked up at us, but no one could check us in. The concierge was kind enough to at least acknowledge us and let us know someone would be with us shortly. Finally we were helped and checked in. We left for dinner and returned around 10pm ready for a good night of rest. Around midnight we were woken up by a woman screaming down the hallway for someone to help and that the guy following her was on drugs and trying to hurt her. We called the",1,1
"Room temperature was impossible to control without leaving windows open (noisy, even on 10th floor). No place to hang a coat or dress in the armoire because of a horizontal shelf. Lighting was substandard by design and at least one bulb was out",2,1
"I'll start with the positives. First, the location is brilliant ... right opposite the Lincoln Centre and easy to get to everywhere else. The staff are helpful and there is a great bar area in the lobby. The bed in our Junior Suite was also exceptionally comfortable.   And then the negatives. First and foremost, and the reason why this hotel will never get another cent of my money, is the lack of free internet. It's free in the lobby but you then have to pay for it in the rooms. In this day and age this is totally unacceptable. In the 1950s you were charged extra to have a hot bath. Times have changed and you would not dream of charging people extra for hot baths in a hotel of this type in New York today. And the world of communication has also changed; internet access (like hot",2,1
"There was only one outlet in my room that would actually charge my phone and that was behind the bedside table which I had to move to access. None of the other more easily accessible outlets were recognized by my phone.   The bathroom door was badly in need of painting.   The rainfall shower head was more like a light drizzle than summer storm. After playing with various components, water pressure remained a drizzle, and this was at various times throughout the day.   There was no chain or pulley on my Roman blinds and I was unable to lower them.   My keycard deactivated before 9am so that I had to have it reactivated when I returned from breakfast so that I could prepare to check out.   Could have used an additional pillow.  Bed was rather hard.   There was no door on the",2,1
"Hotel is in a good location and kept in good condition, the lounge in the rooftop was nice.  However, ladies at the reception desk were not very friendly or accommodating. We went when they were quite busy and rates where high, but customer service was extremely low. We paid about $400 a night to wait in the lobby after a tired trip, room was not ready until 1 hr check-in time. I guess they were double booking rooms since we paid upfront for a suite and got a standard room facing a wall and no refunds were offered. Since we booked thru a travel site all they can say is contact the travel site have them resolve your issue, we can do nothing.  So be ware of paying upfront or thru travel sites as you will be treated as second class citizens.",1,1
"Had a horrible time at the hotel. We arrived early and went out for a bit, and were told that we were to be informed when our room is ready. We waited and waited and saw subsequent guests be given their room right away. I waited further to see more people being given their rooms whilst I'm told to wait. I figured, as we were a honeymoon couple, and that I had requested a potential upgrade (that I am happy to pay for) but was informed the hotel provides ""generous upgrades"" for free, so I thought OK, maybe our room is being readied.   We finally got our room to find it was the size of a shoebox. It was a below standard ""standard"" room that took nearly 4 hours to get ready.  The room's heating didn't work, the shower door was missing, and we had no converter despite being told",2,1
"We arrived on Christmas day and were given rooms on the fourth floor, overlooking the Lincoln Centre.  It was so noisy we had to leave the tv on to try and drown the sound of cars outside.  Our heating unit sounded like a washing machine on spin with nails in it (this was reported twice, but not mended).  Bathroom was tiny and tired.  On the plus side, the doorman and the concierge services were very good.  I would not rate this as a four star hotel.",2,1
"Our room was not clean one day and the following day, we had to complain to double check that the cleaning was actually made. The Gym is small in size and was dirty at 8 am in the morning. Fresh water was not supplied and water cups were not replenished. TV was HS in our room and never fixed during our 5 day staying. Glasses in room are cardboard glasses! not real glasses! Coffe pods used with coffee maker in room are charged and no sugar was supplied. Heating in room is very low and insulation is poor.",1,1
"Hotel was OK,  room very small,  shower door wouldn't shut,  carpet in lobby and mezzanine very worn,  very outdated,  needs refurbishment,  when we were leaving they kept moving us as they were getting ready for new years eve,  not nice as we were waiting to get picked up  for airport so had 5 hrs to wait from checkout at noon,  concierge very helpful.  Definitely not a 4 star",2,1
"I have been in Nyc many times and every time I wish to test some new, so this time following some offer (i.e.: Euro is weak ....against Dollar) I have chosen Empire Hotel. Position it's perfect, close to Columbus Cirlce, almost in front Central Park, just in front Metropolitan Opera House. But this is the only good aspect of the hotel: 1. Room is small, as many in Nyc, but the dark colors used don't help you to have a nice ""perspective"" of the room. Heating system is poor: it's almost impossible to change temperature. So We're sweating all the nights: windows are blocked and so .... Client service doesn't  exists, only Pasquale has been friendly and thanks to him my rating is higher than minimum. So, If you find a bargain it's worth to go to the Empire Hotel, if not it's better",2,1
"We just came back from NYC after spending a night at the Empire, for christmas. I've been wanting to stay at this hotel for awhile, but the service was so disappointing. We went up to our room, and i immediately noticed it was very cold inside, we tried to turn on the heater, but it just kept blowing cold air. A called the front desk and a woman said someone will be up shortly to fix it. Oh and the tv wasn't working, and there were no glasses or cups to brew a coffee... so half an hour later still no one showed up to fix the heater. We went down to reception, to speed up the process. Didn't help, so next time we went to the reception i was ready to just check out and get another hotel, i was so upset. Instead of enjoying the city, on a christmas eve we were stuck at the cold",2,1
"While the hotel overall is nice and located in a good area, we were dissatisfied with the size of the room and the air conditioning/heating.  The hotel is old and the pipes are old.  This is the excuse we heard from the front desk for our entire visit.  We even recorded how loud the noises were in our room from the pipes and we were told nothing could be done.  If you want a good night's rest after a busy day in New York, this is probably not the place for you.  When I say the rooms were small, it was the smallest room I've ever stayed in and it was supposedly a Deluxe King Room.  Won't be back to this hotel unfortunately.",1,1
"Finally decided to give this place a try after years of walking by.  Man oh man, what a mistake.  Yikes is the only word that comes to mind.  I do give them credit for attempting to create a chic modern look in lobby and other public spaces but without basic maintenance & proper upkeep what's the point?  For the excellent location & upmarket surrounding businesses there are simply no excuses for a dirty and indeed nasty interior.  I simply cannot believe the prices that this hotel charges for the subpar service and environment offered.  Do yourself a favor and stay away.  Below picture is demonstrative of the condition of the entire property...",1,1
"Very dull lounge area and being as it was a christmas trip, there wasn't a decoration in site. The bedroom and bathroom were very small.  It was fine for just getting our heads down for the night. We won't be staying here again.  New York was amazing.",2,1
The employees weren't friendly and mostly ignored us. The rooms seemed beat up with cracks in the bathroom door. Room service trays were left for long periods outside of the rooms. There was trash in the hallways,2,1
"I stayed for a week with my 6 yo. Walls are thin that we can hear inappropriate noises from the next room. Things were falling apart in the room. Shower holder came loose, shower hard to operate. Heater broke down on a very cold night. Thrash werent always taken out & towels not replaced. Concierges were very snotty & unhelpful",1,1
"The front desk was very accommodating when we checked in arranging for us to have room with a larger bed than what had mistakenly been reserved through an online travel service. When we checked reservation online it in fact said Queen bed reserved,but front desk said we were reserved in a room with one  double bed. He kindly put us in a new room with king bed. Must have been a room that is not used on the first floor. Wall paper hanger /painter in hallway of first floor didn't move equipment for us to pass which was odd and should have been a sign we were on a floor under renovation. We carried our luggage through the painter's obstacle course and found that the room  had no outlet covers, just bare sockets with holes in the wall around them. Stand up lamp had no bulb, worn out",2,1
The rooms were the smallest I have ever seen and I can't believe they charge what they do. I feel sorry for those that paid even more. No running water for partions of the stay and the last day the hot water was not working,2,1
"Have to say most service was pretty decent, however, the hot water was unavailable in the morning of checking out, it was impossible to take a cold water shower in such a cold day. The checking out staff did not even mention the fact and apologize, instead, trying to hide out. For that reason, I just don't like the experience.",1,1
"Three night stay - two mornings, no hot water, one morning, no water. When you could take a shower, the setup was such that you flooded the bathroom floor every time and had to use your towels as mops. Truly unfortunate because it is a great location and usually a pleasant stay. No compensation offered for the inconvenience, merely an apology. At close to $500/night, there are other options in the area.",1,1
Not a good experience because the temperature of the room was to warm and in the morning the shower was wrong and the wather cold. At least I thing I dont come back in this hotel. Less then I aspect I thing is necessary a refund,2,1
Stayed two nights and regretted it. There was paint peeling off and the floors were dirty. There was no hot water in the bathroom the second day which for a hotel that charged me $450 for a day is inexcusable. Will not go back.,2,1
"Very average hotel. Very small rooms. Didn't have a closet, just 2 hooks and 4 hangers. I asked for a quiet room but there was a very loud roaring noise all day and night.  Super long line to check in and check out. They nickel and dime you for everything: you have to pay to have packages delivered there. The room was so small, so I asked to have the mini fridge removed and they wouldn't do it unless I paid a charge. Really? The room service staff was nice and Yuri, the concierge, was super friendly.",2,1
Get use to the street noise and no complimentary WiFi in the rooms. The hotel charges you after your first serving of tea or coffee in the room. The location was great to be near the arts district and Juilliard.,2,1
"What a missed opportunity by management to ensure customers are happy.  I am a long time traveler and can't believe how poorly we were treated after the NYC water department turned off the water in our hotel.  There was no offer of a free night, nor free anything--well except the manager said we he would not charge us for the bottled water we drank.  Wow, thank you...  As a side note, the housekeeper staff are awesome as were the bellhops.",1,1
"The hotel location is great. But check-in and concierge are very inefficient. Guests can cut queues. Nothing works as expected. Blinds not working. Very noisy room. Most hotel staff are great, but some are unfriendly. One of the worst hotels, if not the worst, that I have ever stayed anywhere in the US.",2,1
300+ for room and they add on wifi.  Insulting.  And no in room coffee available the entire three day stay.  Ok - but better value available elsewhere.  Good location.  Lots to do - close to Central Park.  Look elsewhere in area.,2,1
"The hotel itself is beautiful and in a great location, however filled with staff that you are just a name and number to - they have no interest in actually helping or making you feel welcome. Also, room not ready at guaranteed check in time, with no late check out or upgrade to make up for this. Essentially, paying for a room from a certain time and then not being allowed in it. Rooms are extremely small for what you are paying - Yes it is New York, but I've stayed at plenty other hotels that do value you having a comfortable stay with a bit more space in this crowded and busy city. Beds were nice but quite small, but then again they have to be for the small little rooms. Nice lobby and great bar, generally good environment, but don't come here if you expect a smile and hello",2,1
"The following amenities were broken: telephone, television remote, heating unit, shower. I had to turn the heater off and on multiple times to get hot air. It made loud clicking noises that woke me up throughout the night.",2,1
These guys are absolutely lovely.  The staff could not be nicer or more professional.  But those rooms were sub-par.  I could not have asked for a better location or for a lovelier team.  But until they put some $$ into those rooms to make baseline improvements I am hard pressed to recommend it.,2,1
"We have stayed at the Empire many times over the years. And until our last trip have never had any trouble. We were in NYC for our anniversary in late October and as usual booked a room at the Empire. Got there about 4PM, checked in quickly and then took off for dinner and a show. We were given an interior room on the 11th floor and our air conditioner didn't work a lick. Because the pool is also on that floor it was terribly humid and without being able to open the windows we were miserable all night.  We called and asked for maintenance.....they came and supposedly reset something in the unit but it didn't do anything. The night couldn't have been more uncomfortable...hot, humid, stuffy, not a breath of air. We couldn't wait to get out of there in the morning.  When we were",1,1
"I've stayed at Empire during business travel on a few occasions. The service is inconsistent. The heating/cooling system is one thing that is consistently bad. This trip, there were two staff members who were really great (Patrick and Michael). I wasn't impressed with the others.",2,1
Charged to much.. More than the going pricee. Room was too tiny kept hitting my leg trying to get around the bed. Couldn't get off the toilet too low. Finally moved me to a handicapped room. First room was too small.  You charged $824 for three nights.,2,1
No hot water in shower is unacceptable.  2nd floor was under construction and stairs not easily accessible with construction materials blocking hall and stairs.  Rooftop bar is nice.  Location is excellent.,2,1
the room really was not maintained. The window was broken.  The bed squeaked. The paint was pealing in the bath. The place needs to be refurbished.  Only redeeming part: across the street from Lincoln Center.,2,1
"All of the staff could not do enough to help make our stay as comfortable as possible. However the hotel thwarted all their attempts. The hotel was dark and dismal inside with an uninteresting lounge area. The room was very small and cramped, but gave a great insight into the statement that New York never sleeps. One either stayed awake because of the awful noise of the air conditioning, or the extreme heat because it was turned off. It is the only hotel I have ever visited that makes a charge for using coffee facilities in the room.  It was very convenient for Central park, and there was a bread shop a few yards away that was excellent for breakfast. Plenty of restaurants in the vicinity   Not however a place I would be excited about visiting again",1,1
"I was there for an event at Lincoln Center...conveniently located, but: Room was so small that there was no space for shoes (had to be on top of fridge, which was inside the tiny cupboard), and the bathroom door wouldn't open completely as it hit the toilet. Archaic A/C-Heater system, manual and noisy. Humidity stains on walls. Safety deposit box was not tied to anything, so it was useless. Last day, water boiler was broken, so no hot water in the morning...in New York in November... For $300+ a night, worst experience ever.",1,1
"I have not stayed here yet, a party of 4 of us are staying there for Christmas,I have written 5 emails 4 to customer services and 1 to the concierge, to enquire whether we need to book a table for Christmas day and could they recommend any local attractions that will be available over the Christmas period so we could research and see if we need to book, not one of my emails were answered, so I rang all the way from the Uk, I was cut off before I even had chance to make an enquiry, this is not good customer relations.",2,1
"Hotel faces Lincoln center and is minutes from Central park and Columbus circle, the room was small with peeling paint. The shower knob broke one morning and my keys deactivated twice during my 3-night stay. No free internet in the room which was very surprising.  Overall not a great stay.",2,1
"Hotel rooms need to be renovated badly. Cheap deteriorating structure and decor. There were 2 inches between wall and sink so I had to lean across the toilet to see into the mirror to brush my teeth. There was no hot water, it was ice cold water, that last morning I was there and they refused to comp one night.  Hence why I wrote this review.  Bad Choice, empire hotel.",1,1
"When spending several hundred dollars per night, at the very least I expect there to be hot water in the morning to take a shower... especially at an upscale hotel in NYC. On the morning of our last day, there was no hot water to shower or shave.  I called down to the front desk, and they said they had received several calls regarding the problem, and that I would receive a call back.  I told them that I had meetings first thing in the morning, and that this is a huge convenience.  I received a call back, and I was told that there would be hot water in about a half hour, which was simply too late because I had to get to my meeting.  Honestly, taking a cold shower and shaving with cold water in the winter is simply unacceptable. I told the person who called me back that I paid",2,1
"unpleasant overall, room was way too small for two beds and hv/ac unit kept blowing breaker, was informed we would be moved to another room only to be told no rooms were available nothing was offered in exchange for total inconvenience of uncomfortable room which made for horrible nights sleep.",1,1
"Totally dirty, moldy, switched rooms once, still subpar for this price range. Check in took forever and was past check in time. Room service food mediocre, but main complaint was the dirty feeling to the rooms and halls. No lighting. Dark, depressive hotel",1,1
The room was so hot we had to sleep with the windows open.  We complained but it didn't get fixed  It was very hard to sleep and get ready when you are sweating in November. There was no fan in the bathroom which made it even hotter when we showered.  Just very uncomfortable.,2,1
"Travelling from UK and arriving at 5pm for a two night stay, we were told that only one of the adjoining rooms we had pre booked was ready. The other could be ready soemtime upto 11pm. SInce we were tired, needed to relax and had a child with us, this was not a option we could consider! We we not offered a solution and had to ask for other options of other close by rooms. We were eventually put on another floor with rooms around the corner. No milk in room for tea or coffee and was requested twice, but it never appeared. Really loud air con, which could be turned down, but since the workings were inside a concealed part at the end, I didn't discover that until the second night. On check out, we were told that we had bills to pay for food etc, but since our booking had been",2,1
"I feel compelled to let you of my displeasure if my most recent stay.  My original check in was a very warm and friendly. Hotel lobby was very pretty  The room was small and the air conditioner unit needs to be updated as was awake during night due to being hot Had dinner at hotel restaurant.I had the skirt steak which I didn't particularly like and was served over overcooked sautéed spinach. I was thinking i would come back until the check out process. I was greeted by Pasquale who was incredibly rude. He acted as though he was doing me a favor by helping me and was incredibly indignant.  Between room and dinner i spent over $600 for one night and I would expect better customer service than that. Unfortunately, this will be my lasting impression of this hotel. Pasquale should",2,1
"The rooms and in particular the bathrooms need renovation. All is pretty used and not up to the standard of other hotels in NYC at same or even lower prices. At the high rate, neither breakfast, nor WIFI were included. Windows do not close properly, so it is very noisy at night.",2,1
The room had major issues which were immediately taken care of when identified but they should never had occurred. The location was convenient and the staff was excellent. It is New York and rooms are generally small but this room was too small for two people. It would have been a great single room.,2,1
"If your room number is between 01 and 10 go and find another room or another place to sleep.  The worst thing is the sound of the ventilation system of the building(?). There is no isolation at the windows and you feel yourself like you are still in the airplane. I was there because of the NY Marathon and really had some difficulties to sleep. The good thing is the location. Location is awesome, especially if you finish the marathon at the central park",1,1
"This hotel was so disappointing.  It looks like the hotel hasn't been redecorated or updated in any way for decades.  The wall paper in the hall looks like something from a Willy Wonka movie and the paper in the room is dizzying.  The rooms are tiny.  The bathrooms ridiculously small.  The shower has this weird panel on the wall and only a half door.  The walls and the back of the door of the bathroom,  which is smoked glass, were dirty and peeling.  The whole bathroom felt dirty. The faucet was so close to the drain on the smallest sink I've ever seen in an hotel.  The carpet in the room is old and awful and worst of all I felt like I couldn't walk on it it was so dirty.  Even the air conditioning smelled when it was on.  There was no closet door- just a heavy velvet curtain",2,1
"My family and I stayed at Empire Hotel October 19 and 20.  Four of us were put in a room that felt like we were in the basement with two double beds.  A/C was not functioning properly and humid in the room.  Cons: Dirty, old and tiny. Pros: Good Location  Everything is extra at this hotel.  No free wifi.  The beds are double beds not queen size.  The bathroom had zero counter space and not enough room to set clothes on a clean dry surface to change clothes.  Lots of mold around the shower.  And we got the ""Courtyard view"" Lol!  My kids begged Never again.  I'm from NY so I realize things are small and old, but this hotel room was gross and falling apart.",2,1
"The hotel is in an excellent location, but it is clear that it needs to be renovated.  Our room had several flaws - crumbling ceiling, cracked walls, missing shower door, damaged door to the bathroom, worn furniture.  The beds were at least comfortable.  The view was terrific and we were able to walk across the street to Lincoln Center.  Despite its advantages, we will probably seek out different accommodations for our next trip to Lincoln Center.",2,1
"Hotel was contacted by us days in advance that we would be a late p.m. arrival.  When we arrived at reception desk they informed us that there was bad news and good news.  The bad news was that our room had water damage.  The good news was that they were sending us to their sister hotel, a 15 minute cab ride away and would give us the taxi fare.  We chose the Empire Hotel for location.  Reservation was made 3 months in advance.  We had a conference the next morning, 7 a.m. at the Lincoln Center, just across the street, and had other friends staying nearby.  If Empire would have contacted us earlier about this problem, we could have arranged to find another Central Park hotel location.  They claimed they were unable to notify us but this was false since our email address was",1,1
"The hotel is in an old and characterful building in a good location, but the decor is a bit dated and tired.  They also need new double glazing as both rooms we had were noisy, one from air con just outside and one from the street.  We also had a bad experience with room allocation on arrival.  We turned up at 8pm having flown from the UK, and very tired,  to be told that despite our having booked and paid months in advance, a room was not available for us.  The one they had allocated to us was ""not ready"" as renovation work on it had not finished.  After waiting 45 minutes we were given a room, which we have to assume was the worst room in the hotel and one they only give people when they have no other space.  Directly outside the window were several huge air con outlets from a",2,1
Never will be a guest at empire hotel again. Front desk agent made me stand around while manager yelled at me in front of everyonr about something that was completely  out of my control. Embarrassing.nasty person,1,1
"The first day we came in the whole lobby was 15 degrees! The room was a cheap make over with peeling wall paper, a shower with no door, bathroom sink water shooting out so hard it will wet you! They put a cheap bottle of water on the night stand, and if you open it they charge you $8. They have cheap coffee, which they charge you for, the close has no hanging space because of the safe and mini fridge in it. Speaking of the mini fridge it has 20 different beers none alike.. that blows! The iron board was a crappy mini table top, we had trouble ironing our clothes and the heater was busted! No WiFi unless you paid for it. Most places I have been to have free WiFi, complementary coffee and a stand up iron board! Will not be back!!!",1,1
"My room was dark and dingy; the furnishings chipped and cheap; the wardrobe did not allow for dresses or any long garments to be hung; the bathroom was very small and difficult for anyone taller than 5;3""; the restaurant does not offer ala carte in the morning, only the $26 hot buffet or the $12 cold buffet.   My room was overpriced for such a 2nd rate hotel.",2,1
"The room was incredibly small for the amount of money we spent. The ""closet"" was not suitable for hanging formal attire. Electrical outlets were loose and fewer in number and convenient location than we neeeded. The bathroom door's translucent glass let too much light into the room when the bathroom was used during the night, waking one of us. ... On the bright side, your doormen were fabulous, among the best we have encountered. Very well trained, exceedingly polite and friendly with a warm greeting and ready smile. They are true ambassadors for the hotel. Staying elsewhere next time.",2,1
"Hotel clean rooms but small, tea and coffee facility had to be paid for 3 dollars each!!! Should be complementary only free wifi in lobby. Position of hotel was good not far from Central Park but long walk to Times Square",2,1
"Clean and comfortable and upgraded to a larger room gave us high hopes for this inner city hotel. But it was the small touches that were lacking. Bathroom door hanging off and not mended despite reminders, shower panel at wrong end of bath so the water went all over the floor but more infuriatingly everything had to be paid for at hugely inflated prices. Even a coffee was $3.50 while a bottle of wine was $78. No free wifi in the rooms only in lobby. Good thing we enjoyed the city itself!",2,1
"First the positives. Location is good - a short walk from Central Park and the Lincoln Centre. Metro stop nearby. Bed and pillows comfortable. Shower as good as any hotel shower. Staff friendly. Impressive lobby.  Not so good: we had requested a quiet, high room. We got a room on the 6th floor (The hotel has 11 floors). Whilst we were only occasionally aware of traffic noise, there was a constant background noise from outside the window, possibly something to do with air conditioning. We could not use the air conditioning within the room - it was too noisy. The room itself can only be described as pokey.  The bad: we arrived to discover our wardrobe door hanging by one hinge. We had to ask twice for a repair. Our friends had a similar problem with their bathroom door which was",2,1
"An excellent location, a  helpful staff and comfortable  bed could not overcome the drawbacks of a  shower system too difficult to use and the  safe placed too low to read and operate.  If these drawbacks cold be fixed, I would happily return and recommend this hotel to others.",2,1
"The Empire Hotel, though flashy and proud, has a lot of work to do to keep up with other hotels in the area. The rooms electrical is poorly maintained, the bathrooms are tiny and dirty and the staff is less than helpful.",2,1
"The room was nice, a bit on the small side, but that is to be expected in Manhattan. I could sit on the toilet, shower and wash my hands at the same time: the bathroom is that small.  The pros: wonderful location, right across from Lincoln Center and a few blocks from Central Park. It is also very accessible to public transit: the subway is 2 blocks away and there are several bus stops within a 3 block radius.  The cons: spotty internet that you have to pay for. Loud noises at ungodly hours (and this is not counting the city traffic noises like honking and sirens since Broadway is right there). Unreliable water from the shower. We didn't even have water on the last day of our stay and that is just unacceptable.",2,1
"Overall the Hotel is nice, but a few things did leave me with a poor impression. I had a small problem with the bathroom door in my room, the door did not stay shut or lock properly and the door itself had started to rot. Since I was traveling with a friend not having a functioning bathroom door was a bit awkward and embarrassing at times.  I was most surprised with how the staff handled the situation. No one I talked to seemed very helpful. When I was finally told the the problem would be taken care of, I was disappointed when nothing happened.  Overall, the hotel has very nice social areas, like the lobby and bar, but the guestrooms, hallways, and other floors seem to be neglected.",2,1
"inexcusable performance.  door locks broken--no bolt, no safety swing.  no heat. when heater added, fuses blew.  2 of 4 lamps dead.  when bulbs added, 40 watts of darkness.  candy on floor.  holes in sheets.  bedside plug dead; extension cord from other side overloaded.  worst hotel stay anywhere in years.",1,1
"The bathrooms are a joke--the room couldn't be any smaller and they pack the frig with alcohol and soft drinks so that you can't fit anything you prefer in it.  In order to have all this liquor and beer and wine removed costs a FIFY DOLLAR restocking fee.  After many phone calls and visits to the front desk, I got them to lock the frig and removed the tray of very unhealthy snacks from the room. Wasting my time on this nonsense.  By the way, if you make coffee in the room, it costs you $3.50 per --Starbucks is right around the corner--better off throwing on some clothes and going there. There is absolutely no reason to stay at this place.  Also the check-in person was not pleasant upon arrival..",1,1
We were really looking forward to staying at this hotel after reading rave reviews. What a disappointment the experience proved to be. Stayed for 4 nights in a tiny standard room and not so much as free anything with coffee priced at 3 dollars a cup. The pool was also very small and more like a plunge pool. That we could have put up with but the 'view' from room 901 was a wall. You can check out the photos. The bathroom was also in a state of disrepair with paint flaking from the door and mould on the shower seal. Overall very poor for the price we paid. Wont be back. When we booked out I tols them what I thought and they tried to turn it back on me by suggesting I said something earlier. They shouldn't be giving guests this standard of room in the first place was my retort.,2,1
Aircondition does not work wall plugs broken no place to put anything some beware some rooms have  dark walls outside of windows! /unacceptable bathrooms ! Hideous unworkable showers !!!  / no towel racks except in sky/ no decent closet/ no drawers/ no answering phones from hotel till 5 tries??????? beautiful  bar and lobby,2,1
"This is probably the worst of maybe 3 dozen hotels I've stayed in NYC over the years. Besides the peeling wallpaper, the mold on the ceiling, the thick brown water coming out of the bathroom faucet, the window that wouldn't shut and the accumulated filth on the windowsill, missing knobs on the a/c heating unit, housekeeping not answering the phone, front desk not answering the phone, the room was one of the smallest I've ever been given. Took three different rooms before I was able to get one that was minimally acceptable. The location is perfect for Lincoln Center but there is just no way I will ever stay there again....and it was more than $400 !!!! Unbelievable.",1,1
"Amazing location, right across from Lincoln center so very accessible to the subway as well. Location is the only thing that's worth it, yeah the lobby is cool and it feels nice to say that you stayed at the iconic ""Empire"" hotel, but still not worth it. We were surprised by the fact that there was never anyone at the door to open the door or help us with our luggage when we arrived. We bought a pizza from a restaurant close by and it got cold and we asked if someone could just heat up a few slices and in-room dining said no because they didn't want to be ""responsible for anything that happens to the food,"" which makes no sense to me since you can't really screw up heating up a slice of pizza. That's impossible, even a 10 year old can do that. I asked the front desk as well and",2,1
"The only good thing about this hotel was the location. The lobby looked nice. My room on the other hand was not worth what I paid for it. Dusty, rusty, peeling doors. Ac had odd smell. Bed was ok.....",2,1
I was expecting more from a hotel of this caliber. I was struggling to carry all of my bags and the door men just stood there talking to each other whole I let myself in.   Then I saw them open the door for someone with expensive luggage.   When I got to my room I was thrilled to see a bottled water on the nightstand as I was very thirsty. Luckily I noticed the $8 price tag and didn't open it. I would think that paying as much as I did for the room the least they could do is free water. Then I noticed the phone charger on the floor which led me to believe that the floor wasn't vacuumed after the previous guest left. Then I noticed the ripped wallpaper.  Then I looked out the window and saw what looked like an alley and the side of another building.  I took a shower and with no,2,1
Rooms too small very noisy from the extractions fans from the hotel if you are unlucky enough to get a room on the inside of the hotel it was like sleeping next to a jumbo jet. The hotel has a pool but it was only open in the last day of our stay. The hotel is in a good location,2,1
"The hotel is need of a facelift.  The furnishings are old and worn, and the overall feel is dark and musty.  Our rom had insufficient power outlets (2), no full length mirror and a dangerous step into the bathroom.  There is no complimentary coffee or wi-fi in the rooms.  The saving grace of the hotel is it's fantastic location",2,1
"They tried to give switch me into a cheaper room calling it an ""upgrade"" then when I did get the room I ordered the (King bed) bathroom was so small you could not close the door.  This was my 2nd time staying at the hotel,  I won't be going back.  In the end, the front desk clerk was lacking in customer service skills.",2,1
"Pros: The hotel looks good and has a grand entrance. The room is clean and it has a good selection of pillows.   Cons: I came back from my first day at a conference and found my room door open. It had been cleaned but they had forgotten to close the door. My work computer and all of my belongings were in the room, I quickly saw that nothing had been taken from the room. When I complained I got an ""I´m sorry but there´s nothing I can do for you except notify housekeeping"".  There was a lack of hospitality from the front desk staff, very ""friendly unhelpful"".  The walls are very thin, and pipes in the walls are extremely loud.  The breakfast hot/cold buffet is very minimal and unimpressive.  The mini bar is outrageously expensive and they even charge for the ""in room coffee"" which",2,1
Room was in need of basic repair. Dirty walls water damage in the bathroom. No sugar for coffee. Did not restock coffee or bar. Minimal cleaning each night. Left iorn out. Saw a roach ang killed i. Didn't want to think too much about that luckily last night there. Rug buckling at theropod frame. Wall paper patches. Terrible view of another building. I have stayed a few times. Could have been given a much better room. From Disney and we book a lot of travel. Given the wrong internet code he wrote on 4 digits down and needed 5. General hygiene oh the door men needs improvement. Nice but very scruffy looking. Great location but getting a bit run down. Free wifi was nice. I need of somewhat elements to add some luxury to the rooms seems just not really caring about the guest,2,1
"We booked our reservation after checking out the website of the hotel.  Looked appealing!!  That's our first mistake! Checked into our room about 3:00pm and promptly realized that there was no air conditioning working and the temp was in the 80's outside.  Called the front desk and I was notified that someone would take care of it immediately. At about 9pm a a/c tech came to out room and told us that he couldn''t fix it and gave us 2 fans.  We were told we would have another room in the am. The next day after continuously calling the front desk,  they moved us to a larger room at around 4pm.  We were not happy as you may have expected.  They offered us breakfast coupons! Well, in the end, they offered us a $100 credit for a room that cost about $400 a night plus tax!  That's",2,1
"The shower did not work properly, the bed was to firm, the pool was closed even when it was supposed to be open, the doormen arranged carservice to Newark, but it was 30 minutes late and I missed my flight by 15 minutes",2,1
"WE stayed at the Empire hotel for 3 nights and I must say, this is probably one of the worst.  We have travelled all over the world and I think this one is at the bottom of the heap.  Other than the location, there is nothing to offer.  The room we had was tiny, no closet to put things only an alcove with a curtain.  The rod to hang clothes was so high up, you had to be 6 feet tall, at least,  to use it.  The room was small and dark.  The view was that of the wall of the other side of the building.  The air conditioner sounded like a plane taking off and landing all night long.  Needless to say, we were unable to sleep for  two nights. We informed the desk of the problem and they apparently sent the engineer in to fix it.  However, it did not improve the situation and the noise",1,1
"Where do I start with this property? Well first I really liked the location. It worked out great for us to walk the city and be removed enough from the touristy spots. Easy access to subways and Central Park was a plus.  Room was decent sized and small hd tv was sufficient. Nice looking lobby and inside bar area but like many others have said, the rooftop bar and pool area is typically closed even in beautiful weather.  Now I'll list off my frustrations in no specific order and let you choose if this is the right hotel for you: there is no control of the air in the room which generally meant you will be uncomfortable, a dealbreaker for most. Even on days where the high was 70 it would be over 80 in the room, the building is very old. The windows are very thin, plan to hear",2,1
"Decor is dark and feels heavy.  Not much energy.  The rooftop deck is a lap pool with tables and chairs.  Bathroom sink does not drain easily.  Beds are as hard as a rock, no top sheet. Staff is pleasant.",2,1
See previous comments about room 101 weekend of September 23-25.  No coffee condiments either morning.  No top sheet on bed second night. Bathroom sink drain needs repair. Washcloths weren't replenished.  Prepaid room was adjacent to elevator.  Rooftop bar was not available and that fact was not disclosed on website.,2,1
"Cool hotel at a good location. The small room - to be expected, It's New York after all- was badly in need of refurbishing. The bathroom was tiny and in bad condition. So overall an acceptable stay, no more",2,1
"Pasqual is incredibly rude. They were not helpful when I needed to adjust the dates of my stay. Bellman put his finger up when I tried asking if they could hold my bags for the day and told me to ""hold on"" while he had a non-work related conversation with another employee. Rooms are TINY. Gym is tiny with no windows. TERRIBLE customer experience, especially given the price point. Super disappointing.",1,1
"I understand that running a hotel in a city like New York involves a lot of difficulties and compromises, so I'm willing to put up with a lot. In recent months I've been staying in a lot of different NYC hotels, and they vary wildly, some have tiny rooms looking onto airshafts, others are insalubriously located, etc.   None of that was a problem at the Empire Hotel. I checked in and was given room 418, a lovely room with two big windows directly overlooking Lincoln Center. Sure, the carpeting was a bit grubby, and the front desk could have been a bit friendlier, but hey, this is New York, you can't get everything.   But then when I got into the room it turned out that the blinds were stuck in the closed position: for all that the room had a great view, it was not a view that I",1,1
"The rooms at the Empire are not clean and in need of some basic repairs.    The bathroom doors are cracked, dirty and molding in the cracks.  The frosted glass to the BR door has stained spots all over and appears dirty.  The leather rectangle cube next to the mirror where you would put your luggage had white stains all over it.  The blinds had oil marks and stains all over them as well.   I also found it quite disturbing that the cups for the coffee machine were place right above the toilet in the bathroom.  Beyond Gross! When you flush a toilet, there is a ton of bacteria that becomes airborne so I cannot believe that those cups would pass a health code inspection.   The AC unit made a horribly loud rattling sound so I actually had to sleep without it the first two nights and",2,1
"The hotel is beautiful and much of the staff is helpful and kind. We had quite a few road bumps that might have been outliers, but its hard to say. One of our reservations was cancelled in error, the front desk clerk was rude about our request for early checkin even though we were just asking in case it was possible, the drain in our shower was severely clogged and the repair incomplete and dirty towels left behind (also had to reattach the drain ourselves), and the AC did not function well. Positives are the room is overall well kept and attractive and the location is great for subway access and getting around the city.",2,1
"I spent the last 3 nights at this hotel and it wasn't good...  After returning to hotel after a busy day in Manhattan we found that the maid service had not visited or cleaned our room... Not a major hassle but a service we had paid for but not received.  The following day we returned to our room briefly early afternoon to freshen up... This turned out to be good fortune as whilst we were in the room someone else came into the room... They had been issued a key to our room!! This was reported to the manager and we were given an apology and were ensured that it wouldn't happen again... Later that evening, on our return from being tourists, the security of our room was breached once again!! Another guest had been issued with a pass to our room... Twice in one day and luckily on",1,1
"I have stayed here 3 times because of the location and this time because I needed the pool to entertain my young children during our stay. However I really felt the lack of customer service this time and will not be coming back. I asked the restaurant if they could put my ice packs in the freezer so I could use them on my longhaul flight back to transport some medication but they refused. I was with my 2 young kids & asked if they could open a food container for me (it was closed too tight), dump the food and rinse it out for me but they refused. Another time it was about to rain, it was dinner time and I had my toddlers with me, so I asked the front desk for an umbrella. The response was they're all in the rooms. No one bothers to offer to go get one and as going back up to the",2,1
"Came for one night to see Broadway show; excellent location at Lincoln Center, short walk to all Broadway shows. Historic hotel, recently redone with interesting lobby decor. However, after that be prepared for a comedy of errors. Although I had made an online reservation months before, when I called to confirm they had no record of it, and I had to email my copy of confirmation to get them to believe me. Room was not ready on time, and when we got in, room itself needed repairs, and several basic standard items were not there. As mentioned in many reviews, everything is a charge: $3 per Keurig cup, $10 per device per night for internet, etc. And forget about room service or housekeeping bringing anything up: we had to call 3-4 times and wait an hour for any of the missing items",2,1
The lobby is nice. The location is great. The first room we went to smelled like urine. The replacement room was OK but didnt felt run down a bit and not very clean. $3 for (1) K-cup of coffee is insulting for paying nearly $400 a night rate. I didnt like the condoms and vibrator offerings in the overpriced food tray either...just weird. The place kind of creep-ed me out.,2,1
"The only thing 'nice' about this overpriced old hotel (my company arranged and paid $380/night) is the lobby area, which gives a false sense of what the rooms would be like.  Nothing could be further from reality.    First off, check-in took way too long. Asked for a king high room with no feather pillows/bedding (allergic) and away from vending.  I ended up with a 7th floor ""closet"" with two double beds shoehorned in it.  Feather/down bedding was not changed out.  I call 4 times about it and it took until 10:30 p.m. (I was wanting to go to bed) before someone from housekeeping showed up.    Next, the bathroom. Extremely small with very shallow (couldn't have been more than 2 inches) sink - no stopper.  Mirror was sticking out so far that I couldn't bend over to rinse my face",2,1
"Basic room was not bad size for NY for a couple. Small but enough to move about in. Condition of the decor in the room - curtains, blinds, furniture, lamps, bed surrounds was appalling. It looked like it had been moved from a room that was being done up and was covered in bits of paint or was ripped, worn out, or had chunks missing out of it. I know people say you're only sleeping in a hotel, but frankly, I was embarrassed to leave my parents in the state of the room, and at more than $250 a night I'd expect the room to be properly cleaned. Check in with the person on the front desk was the most ignorant experience I've ever had in a hotel anywhere in the world. Poor experience on the whole which is a shame as the location, and promise of the decor/style of the hotel promise so",2,1
-Took nearly an hour to check in (with only four people ahead of me): Mutliple people kept coming back to the desk (ahead of me) for another room: my associate had to come back down because another of our associates had been assigned to the room he entered ...and that person was already on the toilet when he walked in!!)  Another associate of mine had to come back down and get another room because his room was being sprayed for roaches.  -big patches of mold along baseboards in my room  -sheets were of low quality and were rough  -bed was too firm  -no outlets in convenient locations  -front desk lacked technology to know what room I was calling from...small things like this are annoying...there should be no need for you to ask me my room number when I'm calling for a wake-up,1,1
"Let me start by saying I hate to write this review. I don't like to complain. And I do speak to management before doing something like this to give them an opportunity to correct an issue. I did that and I wasn't confident they care (details below). Plus, there wasn't just one issue but a host of them that made me write this. I write plenty of other glowing reviews, so I don't write this lightly.   In short the hotel looks nice but once you get to the front desk the staff is rude.  With that said, I decided to book this hotel despite some reviews. I thought if the worst people can complain about is ""slow wifi"" I'll be okay. I had two friends stay here before and they said it wasn't a problem, and that they liked the hotel, so I figured I might as well. Boy was I wrong!  Let's",2,1
"We  chose this hotel for its pool, sun lounge deck, gym and central Location. When we arrived the pool was closed (out of season despite 30 degrees C and blazing sunshine), the sun lounge deck had been closed since January for refurbishment (no visible refurbishment activity) and the gym was also closed for refurbishment. The pool did open Friday - Sunday but when we went up the water, in what turned out to be a pool around 2 bath sizes, was dirty/cloudy. Our room ($300 per night)  was tiny, with an even smaller bathroom, which I assume they call the restrooms so they don't even have to supply a bath ?? The shower only had half a door (seemingly intentional) so the bathroom floor flooded every time we used the shower. Our room had been recently (badly) redecorated and I am",2,1
"The bathroom was so tiny the sink was practically unusable, my hubby skinned his hip on the sink cabinet sitting on toilet, bed hard as a rock, hot, 9th floor and outside noisy unbearable, no place for a lady to do hair,nails, ugly wallpaper, just an awful room",1,1
Stayed there for 4 nights. Can't sleep for the first 2 nights due to the air conditioning is not working in the room. The management only willing to change the room on the third day after numerous calls from 11pm till 4am to the front desk to deal with the situation.,1,1
"I would not recommend this hotel to anybody. Bed was  so uncomfortable, Staff not friendly at the front desk. Air conditioner was so noisy that it kept us awake all night and  it was too hot not to have it on.",1,1
I travel to NYC monthly and stay at differrnt hotels.  First time staying at the empire.  As you come in its got a nice decorative lobby with a nice bar area and seating.  It's warm and cozy and nice.  Folks at the front desk are nice as well.  I won't speak for all rooms there but my queen room was tiny tiny as often many can be in NYC.  That would have been find but the AC which worked could not keep he room cool and they must know it as it was on full blast when I entered the room.  Nothing worse that sweating at night when you sleep.  The bed (mattress) was a brick it was so hard.  I might as well have slept on the floor.  Two of the four elevators were broken so the wait was very long.  The pool was closed and I heard from the cleaning people it was all summer.  its a nice,2,1
"Checked in today. No air conditioning in room. No pool. (Apparently closed after labour day) really small room with no closet. All in all a really bad experience and zero value for money. Would not say  recommend to anyone and very noisy too. The room is small , noisy, unpleasant , no cupboard and hot",1,1
"Bedding was dirty upon arrival, the shower glass is so short that when you shower you get to mop up the water that went outside the shower.  Rooms are very small.  Got billed for a water that we did not use.  We do not drink from plastic so it's an easy way to tell we didn't. When asking questions at the front desk it seemed like I was putting them out (multiple times).  Very poor customer service.",1,1
"unpolite service, the roof top bar was closed, because the weather was to beautiful at the week between august 31 and  september 6.We would disturbed at 3.30 AM in the night, because a fire alarm was active and a technician was sedn to controlled this. No one hear such an alarm sirene This hotel will be a film location, not a guest house.",1,1
"You have to pay for internet. The rooms are so small! Request a larger size. We could not even fit our luggage in the room! The shower only has one door, so water pours all over the bathroom if you take a shower. No bathtub. The toilet ran all night, so we could hear it running and running. We called for it to be fixed but it still ran all night the next night. The room was not ready at their check in time. Not even three hours later! It is a good location but there are many hotels nearby that are way better! Oh, we stayed there for the roof top pool. It was CLOSED all weekend. We couldn't even go out on the deck.",1,1
"Booked this Hotel for my Boyfriends 30th, partly due to location and partly due to the Gossip Girl link and rooftop bar and pool! (30th August - 4th September).  We stayed for 5 nights. Upon arrival I was massively impressed by the lobby, the doorman and staff we passed on the way in were very friendly and pointed out which direction reception was located. The lady at reception who checked us in unfortunately did not come across as friendly, no big deal.  Worth mentioning I did email the hotel prior to arrival after I booked the stay to ask if they could organise champagne / strawberries, I never got a reply and when we arrived in the room they sadly hadn't put them in.  To add to this disappointment the room was considerably small, the carpet looked like it needed a good vacuum",2,1
Unfortunately the location was the best feature. I forgive them the very small rooms and ridiculously small bathroom. I don't forgive the fact that the shower wasn't clean and didn't drain or the rooftop pool which is the size of 2 baths or the exorbitant prices of the mini bar and non complimentary coffee.,2,1
"Well apparently this is where gossip girl was filmed that said it sure wasn't filmed anywhere other than lobby! So I wasn't expecting much room size wise and it delivered although my knees almost hitting the bathroom door when I closed it to go the the toilet was abit much I'm only 5.10   The wallpaper was hanging off the walls in places in the room, the bathroom other than being small was perfect.... For a diy project with stained woodwork round the door the shower trim was broken, brown slime round shower seals etc oh and a toilet seat that had what looked like marks from someone using an iron on it!    Still the view was amazing I could gaze a matter of feet across into other guests rooms which I'm sure some people might have loved but for us ment closed blinds no natural",2,1
I stayed while some renovation was going on but that is no excuse for the condition and the lack of concern for the conditions. The room was nice albeit small Dry wall dust covered the hall and was tracked into our room by ourselves as well as room service. Hairs in the bath area. Trash in trash cans.. However when I found a used condom on the floor under the chair I was disgusted. I repeatedly asked for a manager but got no where. I would never stay at this place and could never recommend it to anyone. With SO many wonderful hotels to stay in NYC and at these rates why in the world stay here.,1,1
"I was looking forward to staying here but i soon realised the endorsement for Gossip Girl clearly cost the hotel too much, exceptionally loud aircon units which clearly need replacing , wallpaper peeling off walls, bathroom mould developing, fusty towels and nowhere near clean enough for UK standards. I was very happy to leave and not sure why this hotel was recommended to us ( and i am not a fussy person and neither is my partner) For the money i paid i was not impressed.",2,1
"Very dissatisfied. Hotel was dirty, hot, and staff was unaccommodating. The AC in the room did not work. It was reported upon arrival and not addressed/fixed and by the time they gave up on fixing it there were no other rooms available until the following afternoon. Staff member at front desk was very impolite while handling the situation. At check-out time the staff would only credit back $99 when most of the stay was spent in a room w/o AC. I had to leave the hotel to find refuge from the heat. When asked to speak with a manager on two occasions, I waited for over 30 min and was told one was not available. Will not stay there again.",2,1
"Wouldn't stay there again. Staff did there best to make the stay pleasant but the hotel needs major upgrades. Swimming pool was dirty, bar facilities were limited and the concierge at the time was hopeless. Felt for the staff as they were doing their best but the hotel let them down",2,1
On check in the staff were rude & unfriendly ! The hotel looks old & dated rooms were old & smelt . All the  staff were the most miserable staff we have ever met especially the stuck up receptionists ! The wifi not in the rooms was a joke even when we paid for it we couldn't get it & my husband needed to work ! Were coming back with the family at Christmas & would not rebook ! We've been several times & this is the worst visit! Absolutely disappointed!,1,1
"Stayed in Nov 2015, unless it has been updated the rooms were small and dingy.  The halls and rooms smelled mildewy.  Bath so small you couldn't really open or shut door.  The lobby was ok, but the second you get out of the elevator, you realize you made a mistake to book at the Empire.  Front desk staff was ok, but some security type person was beyond rude.  The location can't be beat, but the property itself is unacceptable.  Husband still complains about the place and it was a year ago.",1,1
Overall everything seemed to be pretty good . The staff was pleasant. Except for the air conditioner in the room since the day of my arrival the ac kept getting messed up and shutting off. I had to keep calling the front desk for them to try and fix it. It was highly unsatisfying trying to sleep in a hot room with the ac turning off every 10 minutes. They resulted in giving me a fan. I wasn't too pleased.,2,1
"Just checked out today after two nights.  Had gone there about five years ago a couple of times and enjoyed it.  Now, forget about it!  Pros:  Rooftop area and lobby nice, good location, comfortable bed..  Cons:  Picture of pool is deceiving  Rooms are decorated horribly.  Towels are worn out.  Given one tiny bar of soap.  Toilet clogged, had to call maintenance.  Sink didn't hold water.  Shade wouldn't pull down or up.  No drawers to put clothes.  Armoire where you hang clothes had shelf so clothes couldn't hang properly. No room in bathroom for anything.   It has potential if someone would manage it and fix everything!!!  Would not go back.",2,1
"Small, AC units can't keep up, and the worst bathroom design I've ever seen. No shower door on the side where the shower head is and water literally puddles on the floor while you shower. No place to put your bathroom things to get ready. Not good.",2,1
"Front door staff and bar staff are the only high quality elements to this hotel. Don't be fooled by the plush lobby, the rooms are stuck in the 70s. Whilst the rooms are passable for the money you pay there seems to be a distinct lack of care shown to the rooms, dusting, general maintenance etc. There is no free wifi which in this day and age is pretty poor. The beds are extremely uncomfortable and the air con has no settings, it's either freezing or off.   The roof terrace is excellent as are the bar staff but don't think you'll be getting any swimming done.   I had asked reception staff 3 times prior to arrival to sort and upgrade out for me and my girlfriend for our room given I was proposing, sadly this never transpired.   The location of the hotel allows you to walk to most",2,1
"Gone are the days that Chuck Bass would have been proud to own the hotel, paying over $1,400 for 7 nights is expensive but New York always is, my issue came from the room. I do not expect to spend that sort of money and have to straddle the toilet in order to enter the bathroom! Neither do I expect to have to hurdle over our suitcases as there is not enough floor space for 2 people in a double room! We decided to go to the advertised 'outdoor swimming pool' I have seen children's paddling pools which are bigger! Upon asking where the swimming pool was the staff laughed and said 'that's it' clearly understanding it was a joke! Although the 'pool' area has a bar the actual roof top bar was shut in January for renovations and has not been reopened, to the dismay of many guests...",1,1
"Poor check in service, I ordered tickets to take my mom and son to a show at 3:00pm. We arrived to the hotel at 1:00 and was told there would be a room ready by 2:00 for us, at 2:00 the rude lady at the check in desk said we couldnt check in until 3:00... Which I find hard to believe cause Ive seen people checking out all day as we sat there in the lobby. We missed our show that I paid $250.00 for because our luggae was in the bellman room and all our stuff to get ready was in there, and we had no room to put our stuff in once we left. So I am out $250.00 and I feel like I wasted my money staying at the hotel. Also, that night we ordered a pizza and I got a calll from the front desk to come down and pick it up so once I got down there I had to wait in a 15 minute line of people",2,1
"Pros: Location!  Quick walk to subway, short walk to Central Park.  Starbucks, quaint restaurants, 24 drug store all close.  Heard very little noise from other rooms.  Cons: Staff uninterested and unhelpful, once outside of lobby everything is tired and dated. TWICE staff walked into our room without knocking (once mini bar person, once housekeeping).  King size bed was hard and the sheet is the duvet cover, no separate sheets. Walk up flights to rooftop pool makes the subway look clean and polished - ridiculous.  The pics on website make this hotel look very swanky, but it's much more skanky.",2,1
"The bed wasn't comfortable and the AC is a wall unit in your room that is very loud and runs 24/7 and you don't have the option of turning it off. The room, at least the one I was in needed a lot of improving. I know The Empire is a cheap place to stay but there are better places in the neighborhood that are a lot more comfortable. Oh, and I got mosquito bites while drinking at the bar... so, my trip was a real bust.",2,1
"What a state  The thing most needed a cool room when temp outside is 100 degrees   Bedroom   Cool box buttons broken   Bathroom   No No no Fan in bathroom   Whole place steamed up even the room  As door would not close as swollen up .  Tiles cracked , no shower door  Shower head damaged leaking   Dining area   The waiter napkins Droped and 3/5 mns later picked up than recovered same napkin the juice jugs .  And of course  Gabriel had stated please put it on email will see what the management would do   Nothing as u gone :(",1,1
"We stayed 4 nights at Empire Hotel at end July. Initial expectations were good when we arrived in the lobby, it's nicely decorated and has has a lux feel. However, the rooms don't live up to this. Ours was on the 1st floor so barely slept through the noise outside. There's no double glazing. The decor was tatty and felt old. There is nowhere to put bags so with 4 people and luggage it was chaos. We chose this hotel because of the pool, however if rain is forecast it closes.....we didn't get to use it once! Access to the pool is a grotty stair, then an underwhelming rooftop area. Pool looked dirty but since we didn't go in I can't confirm. We paid $250 a night for this. Not worth it, pay more elsewhere or same for better room.",2,1
"I'm writing the review as I am sweating in my hotel room after a sweltering, largely sleepless night.     When I checked in, my room was unbearably hot.   When engineering couldn't fix the ancient AC unit, they ""upgraded"" me to a suite on a different floor  - where there are two ancient and nearly as useless AC units.   Yes, NYC is in the midst of a heat wave, but no, a hotel that bills itself as a 4-star property, with chic decor and a hip lobby, shouldn't feel like an old college dorm during summer session.   Apparently, the decor has been upgraded but the infrastructure has not.",1,1
"Check in was a mess sadly, our booking wouldn't come up. They were rude to most of the group and rooms weren't ready. Some waited up until 4pm. They just have a very poor understanding of what it is to be hospitable and work in the industry where service is everything. Bathrooms were extremely small and shower was hard to work. There is no way you can turn the shower on without the shower wetting you. Luckily what has put me off this hotel, these are all things easy to fix. I hope they do.",2,1
"I was there for a business trip . The location was great as it is close to a lot of places of interest. But I found my room to be generally dirty as the walls had stains , curtains and Windows  were dirty as well as dusty vents . I expected the rooms to be up to the standards featured on their website but it was nothing like it! I will not recommend it unless you don't mind paying for an expensive hotel but feeling like you are in a motel on the road!",2,1
"Get into the 21st Century - coffee in rooms should be free, wifi in rooms should be free. If you charged reasonable prices for the mini bar it may get used, but $70+ for a 70cl Merlot and only cardboard cups to drink it from is appalling. Safety should be paramount - putting brackets on windows to prevent them opening far is a fire hazard if there is a fire in the corridor - a person could not escape through that sized opening. Double glazing might prevent outdoor noises from being a disturbance - when you are on the 1st floor (above the Lobby and Mezzanine levels) hearing conversations outside is extreme. This was not the best experience of a US hotel, I have been in far better and not charged as much for everything either. This hotel seems to be an example of raking in as much",2,1
"We arrived at the hotel to check in around 4:30am.  The hotel receptionist was very courteous.   However initially I was told my room wasn't ready but would be completed in 5 minutes.  I should've known it was too good to be true.  An hour and a half later I was given a different room.  When I went up to the room, the AC did not work correctly.  It was blowing warm air on one of the hottest days of the year and the room temperature was so uncomfortable.   I went down to the same receptionist to complain and was told she would send up an engineer to check and fix the AC.  The engineer came, played with the knobs and had the nerve to tell me it was working.  If I didn't have some class, I would've told him to leave.   My face drenched in sweat was my own imagination.   If you ever",2,1
The current temp in my room is 80 degrees and rising! The front dest girl was sweet and nice but since the hotel is full there is nothing that can be done. The cost of my room was over 300$ and it is really bad to be completely sweating and unable to sleep. I read reviews from 2014 about the AC being bad but read it was taken care of. Just lnow that it has not and the rooms are so hot! Unbearable.,2,1
Ok 1st off the door man was the only helpful nice employee everyone else was rude and not welcoming at all we were in the city for my birthday went on trip advisor to book it was the closest with pool lol pictures made it look amazing but it's outside o. Roof and the size of 3 of my tubs but had hair all in it the room looked good but couldn't fit anything in the fridge it was full of beer booze water and felt as if everything in the room had a price tag on it the waters on side of bed and snacks in room even the coffee pot cost money to use I know it's NY but for the price I paid for the room I should be able to have a free cup of coffee and a shower that wasn't missing the 2nd half of the door totally flooded the bathroom never staying again mostly because of staff and shower,2,1
"The hotel was awful!  Dirty rooms (tried 2), not maintained, moldy ceilings and window, dirty wallpaper, bugs smashed on wall, clearly not renovated in years.  In desperate need of make over.  Not worth the price even for location.  Pool over sold.  Small and being by roof top bar not appropriate for family's including the acceptance of topless sunbathing.  Stay away!",1,1
"Whilst here on a work holiday we have been staying in a number of hotels and this is by far the worst.   We couldn't check in until 16.30 and then the staff were very rude.   Here are a few others issues,   Broken shower Mould in the bathroom - and it's very small Tatty furniture (torn bedding, peeling wallpaper, all furniture is scratched or broken)  Damp bedding (had to get it changed it was so bad)  Coffee tea and water is all a cost The bed is very hard There's no sound proofing whatsoever when someone closes a door near your room it'll wake you up, and there's venting outside the building so it sounds a lot like being on an aircraft (this gets very loud every hour or so which will also wake you up)  All in all I wouldn't stay here again. I'm even dreading staying here one",1,1
"I had several thousand dollars stolen from the room safe.  Chief of hotel security Michael wright said he would contact us but but now I cannot contact him. The front desk will not put me in touch with hotel management and say the issue is now being handled "" legally"" . We payed over $330 for a small room and then had several thousand dollars stolen from the safe. The hotel knows one of their employees took the money . Do not stay at this hotel and most defiantly do not leave money in the safe!!!",1,1
"The bed was comfortable and staff was friendly. Being near Lincoln Center is great but not if you are staying at the Hotel Empire. We stayed in Room 141, which we think was formerly the broom and mop closet. It was shockingly small as compared to similar hotels in NYC! The room had a small desk with a simple chair, bed and one bed side table (a second one would not fit in the room).There was a tad more than a foot from the bed to the wall resulting in my friend and I constantly banging our knees and toes.  Our average size luggage was on the desk chair and floor -there was no real space for our luggage and the luggage racks we requested never were delivered despite being requested. Loud noises from bathroom pipes were sporadic. Paint on the walls was chipping. The wallpaper was",1,1
"Dirty, peeling paint, stains on bathroom walls (blood? - yuck), chipped, cheap furniture. Great location and price, but you get what you pay for. It has a photo worthy lobby, but the rest is tired and needs updating.",1,1
"This hotel is aesthetically nice, but the service is TERRIBLE. I reserved a suite with 2 double beds months in advance for myself, one other bridesmaid, and the bride to share the night before her wedding. I also made sure to add the bride's name to the reservation so that she could access the room prior to my arrival. I called to confirm the double bed suite and the additional name on the reservation prior to the arrival. The bride showed up and was told her name was not on the reservation, and she was not granted access to the room. Additionally, they put us in a suite with one bed. They were able to move us rooms after we complained, but not without giving us attitude and using the excuse that their reservations are outsourced. We did not receive an apology or any",1,1
I asked for an early check in and a room with a view prior to my arrival. At 1:30 I was told my room was not ready and had to go to the pool bar  because the rooftop bar was closed. The main reason I booked this hotel was for the rooftop. After three trips to the front desk with the same story about the room not being ready I was given a room with a view of the building next door at 4pm.   I stay in New York several times a year and this by far was my worst experience.  This hotel was not cheap and in my opinion there are far better hotels on the upper west side.,2,1
"Principle spaces a bit tired and elevators were in need of a good once over. Our room's decor was unattractive and even though it had just been turned over and was clean did not give the impression of being clean due to the musty smell and shop worn condition of furniture. Courteous staff at front check in desk. The lobby bar was fine, staff were attentive, we did not check out the mezzanine restaurant or lobby bar Originally booked for 3 nights checked out after one, the Empire's best asset is its location to Lincoln Centre.",2,1
This is an old classic NYC hotel. Small rooms. Tiny bathrooms. Old and tired furnishings. The staff tries hard but they are stuck with an old property. It is in a very good location across from Lincoln Center and two blocks from Central Park. Lots of good eating within easy walking distance. Too bad the hotel hasn't been refurbed in a while. The room/bathroom size can't be fixed even it the hotel is refurbished.,2,1
"Good Location but strange Management Policies; removal of shower doors and allow room to 'flood', no bathroom ventilation and advice to use extra towels on the floor; as a result the room smelt damp. Small room with noisy Air Conditioning. Dated appearance due to brown wallpaper throughout public area. Everything is charged for at a high rate; not even tea/coffee facilities in room. Not impressed.",2,1
"I won't write a lengthy review, but simply say this is a sort of place to rest for the evening if your sightseeing NYC, but for folks that need a nice hotel and nice room, look elsewhere. The amenities like the pool deck are a joke so don't even think your getting a deal. The rooms here need gutting but because the location is desirable, patrons will likely put up with it to save a buck. Holiday inn rooms are better than this, but maybe this is nyc ""character"" some people seek.",2,1
"Only the location will give this place any worth. Sadly, the potential for this hotel to be great is missed on many levels. Recently had to stay for over a week and there were too many issues to even bother about complaining everyday.   The air conditioning in the room repeatedly did not work, would shut off and would require a phone call to the front desk & 45 mins until it would magically turned on. Several times did it turn off in the middle of the night and one would wake in a hot room, i always wondered what sleeping in a cave in the city would be like. Why not open the windows? well NYC was having a heat wave, 90s all around. so why add more to the oven room. Secondly, upon asking within daily returns to turn on the air, it would still take over an hour for anything to",2,1
"What ever you do don’t stay at this hotel in the summer. The AC didn’t work properly. We called the front desk and they sent the engineer. He said it was a problem with the water tower and the entire floor (11th) had the same problem. As I was walking out the door I herd the woman in front of me saying her room was the outside temperature (about 88F) as well. They did offer to move us to a lower floor, we declined, our floor was noisy enough.  We checked into a “Superior King Room” and next to the bed, looking like a gift were bottles of water with a label like those in Alice in Wonderland- instead of “drink me” they indicated that this bottle of water would cost me $8. There was the normal mini bar, although many hotels have given up because people have figured out it is a rip",2,1
Air conditioning units leaked all over the carpeting and barely cooled the room.  Temperature was awful. No fan in bathroom made room humid from shower. No one likes to answer the phones after 9:30 pm.,1,1
"Really poor service. Here with family of 5 and attempted for over 1 hour to contact front desk, concierge, valet - anyone so that we could get covers for pull out coach for kids. 10pm. 11pm. Nothing. Finally around midnight someone delivered sheets. You get what you pay for.",1,1
They charge you for any thing and everything without telling you. The rooms are small and the view is not that great. The swimming pool is 2x4 feet and the water in it is not clean. The only good thing about it is the proximity to the central park. I don't recommend it to anyone.,1,1
"Staff is too cool and faux hip to exercise humanity or compassion. If you are staying here because it's close to Mt Sinai forget it. No food service after 10 pm and when I explained I had just spent 17 hours at the hospital and asked if someone could just bring up a bowl of soup from the dining room, I got a cold ""Sorry we can't it's policy"" speech.",2,1
"Having heard some great things about this hotel, what we experienced was substandard at best.  The experience at check in was terrible. We had been travelling in a group and ample notice had been given yet we were left waiting over an hour for our rooms. Despite arriving well after normal check time of 3pm.  During our stay we had made use of the ""pool"", which is more like a kiddies splash pool. After using it we noticed our wedding bands had become discoloured and tarnishes. Upon investigation with our jeweller it was found that there was an excessive exposure to chlorine.  The hotel accepted no responsibility and offered no help in ensuring that our wedding rings would be repaired.  That same day we had ordered a beer bucket from the waitress and despite looking at it from our",2,1
"So here's a mid range hotel in the upper west - I usually stay midtown or around here... My go to hotels are the Parker Meridian, the Quinn , lately the ""One""- the very green hotel. So yes I get that for 300+ you are not going to get in nyc what you get in Savannah or even Napa or somewhere in Florida. But that price is typically what I pay at those other three.. (On my monthly visit to nyc)  . For some reason the Parker was jacked up this time so I decided to try the empire.   But seriously, this is a hotel that takes itself way too seriously. It's not terribly upscale, doesn't even aspire to being posh . But the lobby and bar think they are. I normally don't post unflattering pictures but in this case I have to. ( see pics) the only upside is the convenient location. ( to the",2,1
"When we checked in the hotel, the room was supposed to be ready at 3:00 and we were told it would just be 15 minutes because they were upgrading our room to a really nice large one.      Maybe it was just my luck to get the three worst rooms (or) maybe the rest of the rooms are the same.  At 3:45 , the first room was finally ready and it smelled heavily of paint in the hallway and the room.  We refused the room before we put our luggage down as the smell was so strong.  The second room provided to us was on a different floor and smelled of bleach (as though someone dropped a bottle of bleach on the carpet) we couldn't even walk in the room (neither did the bellman).  And our third room, (now its 5:00)   did not smell but was old.   The bedskirts on both beds were ripped on the",1,1
"The Empire Hotel is the worst  hotel in New York , with no customer service. The cleaning staff are dishonest and the employers didn't go to any length to help us. It may be a great location for shows at the Licoln centre however it's not an enjoyable place to stay with staff being so dishonest .",1,1
"Not a bad location for a hotel, however these days I am not sure it is pardonable not to have wifi thrown into the package. That definitely takes away two stars in my opinion. I guess you can add the price of wifi to the bill as a strategy, but asking guests to pay for wifi usage in the rooms is kind of outdated. Stayed here for two days. Good thing about the location is the convenience store nearby and a Starbucks at the street corner too.",2,1
No air conditioning. Had to sleep with the window opened and room became too noisy. Bath area only partially closed - whole bathroom became wet.  Not the cleanest room. Excelent location and staff very friendly and efficient.,2,1
First experience was the room. We were given a room at the back with a view of the hotel Laundry with big exhaust pipe emitting steam! After pleading/arguing we did a good room. We had topay two dollars for a bottle of water! which is complementary in most hotels.,2,1
"Just spent 5 nights at this hotel while in NYC for my daughter's college graduation.  Paid $385 for a Superior Double-Double.  Disappointments began from the moment of check in.  While I recognize that there are still some hotels that charge for wifi access, most will allow at least 3 devices to have access through the paid network.  Not the Empire, wifi is $9.99 per day, per device!  That's right - don't think about two people in the room using their laptops unless you want to pay $20/day.  Traveling with teenagers?  Forget it!  The next surprise came upon entering the room - we were on the first floor at the bottom of an air shaft.  Our windows looked out upon a maze of old ductwork, fans and trash.  Natural light was non-existent.  Room was tiny and had seen better days and",1,1
"THE GOOD: Nicely located near Lincoln Center and lower Central Park. Friendly staff. Clean. No bugs. Safe feeling environment. THE BAD: The room (queen bed) was incredibly small. Tiny bath with peeling paint.  All amenities (Wi-Fi, in room coffee maker, etc.) are billed extra. The entire property seems an example of faded glory and substandard maintenance. All told, equivalent to a $75 Super 8 in most parts of the country but without Wi-Fi and breakfast. THE UGLY: Seventy-five percent of the flat (storage) space in our tiny room was crowded with ""for sale amenities"" (i.e. wine, coffee, $8 bottled water and even a $35 umbrella!) Me thinks a room should include room for the guest!",2,1
Rooms and bathroom so small you could not turn around. Kept injuring legs on foot of beds.Font stay on high floors in summer. Old AC system can't cool the room. Primitive AC system. Hot as Hell.Doormen were A plus,1,1
"Disappointing for the price. Tired decor, the breakfast room doesn't open before 7am, staff less than friendly, cockroach in the bathroom, dirty curtains, $2.50 for an in-room teabag; I could go on....",2,1
"Avoid at all cost!!!  Rooms and halls smell.  pealing paint, damaged wallpaper, AC can't cool room if you take a shower, dirty, airplanes have bigger restrooms.  Door will not close unless you pull it shut. I would never stay here again!!!!!!  For such a small room there was a ton wrong.  The only nice part was the doormen.",1,1
I will preface this by saying I have never once asked to switch rooms in a hotel. Never once. My first room I was given at the Empire Hotel had a pull out bed from a couch as a bed. It was clearly a suite split into two rooms. Unacceptable. The person at the front desk acted surprised that I was not happy with the room but was very nice and got me a new room. This new room had the ac/heat unit for the building outside the window which was incredibly noisy. Way noisier than the city sounds! I am from Boston so I am not too particular about noise. I once again asked for a new room since I don't think I should have to choose between a real bed and a quiet night's sleep. I also asked about a refund but I had prepaid on Trip Advisor. Finally I got a better room on fifth floor. I had,2,1
"I had a room on the first floor (actually the third floor, but the first floor of hotel rooms). I brought a white noise machine with me, which turned out to be a great decision since taxis honking their horns would otherwise have been a problem. The shower water temperature was at best lukewarm. A Keurig coffe machine in the room offered the opportunity to be charged $3 for making a cup of coffee, which was cheaper than the bottled water or the internet service in the room. The bathroom was quite small. But the price was cheaper than the Mandarin Oriental a block or so away. The lobby is nice.",2,1
"Very conveniently located, and this is the best thing about it.  For the price, I expected more from the hotel. They charge you for wi-fi, and for coffee and tea in the room (never saw that before!), the closet has no drawers, the room is small and the inside view terrible. Noisy at night.",2,1
"The only pros of this hotel are the location and friendly doormen/valets. However, the location is also a con. Because this hotel is located between 3 very busy streets, it is very noisy 24/7. Yes, it is a city, and I am use to city traffic/noise; however, this was non-stop blasting car horns and trucks. While the traffic is outside the control of the hotel, the hallway noise was an issue as well; there is a large gap under the door - as a result, every noise in the hallway was amplified. The biggest problem I had with Empire Hotel is the cleanliness. The carpets had dust balls, especially near the edge of the bed and curtains. The bathroom floor was not clean, nor were the tiles in the shower. It looked like the cleaning staff did a quick wipe down of the room. Unfortunately,",2,1
"the room was poorly furnished, a terrible  view of a wall and the bathroom was so small that was quite impossible to close the door. Complitely disappointed. It was a pity because the location  was good",2,1
"This was my second stay at the hotel. The location is good, opposite the Lincoln Centre, however it is not good value for money. There is only free wi fi in the lobby which is appalling in this day & age & for the rates paid. The lobby was full of people catching up on wifi. I stayed in room 933. The bathroom was dreadful. Grout in the tiles missing, rust stains along the shower screen, peeling paint on the door. Admittedly it was clean but so shabby I went to the lobby to complain. The receptionist apologised & said she would change the room for me. She then said that it was actually a refurbished room so there would be no change & that was that! I suggested that a manager check the bad state of the bathroom but I heard nothing more, no feedback, no room change, no discount.",2,1
"I gave this hotel two stars--one for location and one for price.  I was really grossed out by the layer of dust underneath the bed--the carpet was a different color because of the dust.  I also complained about the slow draining tub, and dust around the light/fan in the bathroom.  It was totally gross.",2,1
"The hotel looks amazing, the lobby is impressive, nice bar area and the roof terrace sounded great, however the rooms are tiny, lack basic amentiies, like a mirror and lighting, nothing is complimentary, the plug points were even useless and the staff were a mix of helpful to rude. I won't be back.",2,1
"Last fall we went to New York for 4 day vacations and were excited to stay at Empire Hotel. Our room was awful! I don't think it supposed to be a room, more like mop closet. Soooo tiny!!! After complaining for a while, they moved us to a better room next day. Would not stay there again",2,1

"Spent two weeks at Empire - girls holiday away from usual hassles as we were staying 2 weeks we booked a junior suite as thought the extra room would be useful. Very disappointed - room very dark, no central light in room, just lamps, queen beds x 2 very comfortable, lounge area non existent and if one had sat on lounge it would take you a day to get out of it as was low and so spongy! No writing desk, on whole very inadequate room. One of the reasons I wanted to stay at Empire was the rooftop bar, which of course was closed over the cooler months, but there was no information on website (that I read) that stated this. Will compliment the cleaning staff but front desk very disappointing.",2,1
The hotel was pretty. The staff was friendly. The location is excellent. The price is economical. However we didn't have hot water. We were suppose to stay 3 nights and stayed 1. It wasn't able to be fixed and there wasn't another room for us.,2,1
Lobby and restaurant contemporary and but rooms outdated and neglected.  The food at Ed's Chowder was exceptional.  Cocktail hour and drinks in the lobby was vibrant.  Room was outdated and not in the standard one expected from this type of hotel.,2,1
"Choose another hotel.  We stayed at the Empire Hotel on April 9th.  After checking in to our room, I went to the front desk and indicated the wallpaper was peeling, paint was chipping and the bathroom had several spots and patches of rust.  They responded they would notify housekeeping.  We were not moved to a reasonably maintained room. I called to speak to the General Manager on April 11th and was only able to leave a message in his voicemail.  My call was not returned and I called again on April 19th.  I was told the General Manager was not available so my call was transferred to another voice mailbox.  I again left a detailed message and have not been contacted. Not only was the room poorly maintained, the staff has no intention of resolving concerns.",1,1
The room was little and worn And very dark!! Right out to a backyard with junk!! Overall both room and toilet/bathroom neede at BIG makeover. Only free wifi in the lobby. NOT and i mean NOT value for money.,2,1
"I just stayed ther with family for two nights and itv wasn't bad but needs some up dating. Beds were fine, room only had a shower. I am not sure if it was dirty the hotel but gve me the impression it s sort of scruffy and could use a good cleaning and some updating.",2,1
"The location of the hotel is fantastic! The room, not so much. We stayed in a superior king room. The wallpaper was peeling throughout the entire room. The ridiculously small bathroom left it nearly impossible to get ready. The bed skirt was filthy. Complimentary Wifi was stated in the room description however, that's only in the lobby. Charging for Keurig coffee in the room is absurd. Heater clicked & churned loudly throughout the night waking us each time. There's a fitted sheet on the bed & a duvet. When we asked for a flat sheet, our request could not be met. Overall, if we had paid more than $150 for the room, we would have felt ripped off.",2,1
"- Employees were very nice and helpful - The lobby is old, weathered, and dirty - Elevators are very dirty - especially the side panels - Hallways are dirty, carpets need replacing on some floors - The bed was very nice - very firm mattress - Radiator made a banging noise several times a night - loud enough to wake up to - No WIFI in room - WIFI in lobby good  - Plug in sink didn't work - Location is very good",2,1
The room had various areas of water damage. Paint/wallpaper peeling from wall. Floor was uneven by the desk. The bathroom was very small the rain-head shower did not operate at all. Something what looked to be mold on one of the ceiling beams on several places. The hotel Shuttle policy is not helpful when you call for Two days before departure to New York and they will not return phone call messages or answer the phone.,2,1
I have stayed in this hotel several times because the location is perfect for Lincoln Center. Some of the rooms are ok but there too many to count that need major renovations. The Standard Room is the size of a large closet - you can not put a suitcase on the floor and walk around the bed small. The bed was hard as a rock with flat worn pillows. The cranky heater could not be shut off - even when you turned it off it mysteriously turned back on every 20 minutes all night long. The bathroom was tiny which was fine but there was mold on the rotten wood door frame. The bath products were nice. The WIFI costs $15 a day for in room use and is spotty at best. They charge for Keurig pods for coffee in the room. There is free WIFI in the lobby and the roof deck area is quite nice.,1,1
"I have enjoyed attending Lincoln Center across the street for many years. My routine would be having a cocktail in the lobby bar before the ballet would start. However, for some reason around 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon the bar was completely closed! I had to take myself and all of my guests elsewhere! Empire is definitely losing its charm. Catering to patrons of Lincoln Center should also be a priority.",1,1
"we stayed in this hotel for 4 days. the shower had no door or tend available resulting in the bathroom completely wet after taking a shower. I asked at the reception and I was told that the customer were braking the doors and due to the risk of injury they decided to remove them all. only 1 shampoo and 1 shower bath available in room even if we were a family of 3 lodging in the room. only paper cups available even if the minibar included wines and spirits, I had to ask twice for regular glasses. remote control was missing and we had to ask for it. the day in which it was raining I asked for an umbrella at the reception and before asking me if I did not find the one in the room they told me that I had to pay for it. I explained that I did not have any umbrella in my room and",1,1
Had a broken air conditioner in first room.  Tried to get it fixed three times.  They eventually switched us to another room at midnight. It also had a broken heater/air condition.  Very noisy place too.,1,1
"When you book a 'privileged fare' at $378 dollars for 1 night you expect to find a beautiful service, and an outstanding set of features in a hotel.  Well Roof Top was closed (both of them), Our room (I requested a double queen bed) was at the Pool level (which was the best one) and it was old, with wall paper ruined, the bathroom was not a bathroom but a cubicle; Then a bottle of water $8, and, this is totally unbelievable, the in-room coffee machine available was to be charged $3 for each coffee made (it was a very normal automatic little machine, like the ones you find in motels). And, i forgot, no internet in the room, of course. Sorry, I travel constantly... but this is really a robbery.",2,1
"Stayed for 3 days in early March, when NY temperatures were around 46F (8C), typical for this time of year.  In the absence of any instructions in my room for the rather decrepit-looking air conditioner, I naively asked at reception how to work it.  ""Don't bother, you won't get any heat out of it"", was the cheery response, ""There's no heating on in the hotel as it's not cold enough"" (!)  And of course that meant no ventilation either, as it was too cold to sleep with the window open.  How a hotel can operate like this in the 21st century is beyond me.",1,1
"I stayed at the Empire Hotel on week-long business trip to New York, booking it on the recommendation of a colleague. Wish that I had checked the Tripadvisor reviews before confirming, as much of what is criticised by others here is accurate. To summarise my experience:   Rooms I had two rooms during my stay. The first was called 'courtyard' view, but this equates to the light-well in the rear of the buildings on the block. Natural light very dingy and dark, particularly on the lower floor where I was, and not helped by the low voltage lighting in the room - the compensation being that it was quiet. The second room was on a higher floor, looking up Broadway and over the Lincoln Center. Better view, highlighting the dirty windows, which really do need cleaning inside and out.",2,1
"I was traveling on business, but had my family with me.  I normally stay at another hotel in the Columbus Circle area, but it wasn't available so I was actually looking forward to trying a different hotel.  Location seemed great opposite Lincoln Center, but  it was so noisy with all the traffic of both Columbus, Broadway and 63rd Street- they really need some better windows.  At first i thought it was a nice looking room, but then started to notice all the issues.  The smoke detector was gone from the ceiling with just the wires dangling.  The shower drain was clogged so I was afraid it would overflow if my shower lasted any longer (it took a full 25 minutes for it to drain after I got out).  The controls on the shower are missing pieces, and the temperature was hard to control.",2,1
"The location is great. Having said that the hotel itself is in need of help. The rooms are terrible and gross. Forget about taking a shower and if you do you still wont feel clean. The bathroom is so small and you cant even wash your hands in the sink without getting water all over you. The shower is disgusting with mold and dirt. The bathroom door has peeling paint and is cracked. The carpeting in the room is disgusting, worn and smells. The airconditioning unit is so filthy you don't want to touch it. There is only one garbage can in the room. The outlet is coming out of the wall and if you want to plug something in then you have to unplug a lamp. The rooms are dark as well as the hallways and lobby. Like I said the location is fantastic but that's about it.",2,1
"Great hotel, really well placed and pretty affordable but the staff are unbelievable.   Rudest check in I've ever experienced. Breakfast staff who wouldn't take ppls orders, eggs Benedict done wrong, and cleaning staff that invade your room without your permission.   Perfect example of a hotel where the staff are so busy running the hotel they forget guests also stay there.   Board line terrible.",2,1
"If you want to be close to the Park, across from Lincoln Center, a three minute walk to Columbus Circle  then, in terms of location, this place can't be beat. Unfortunately, it CAN be beat in most other ways - or at least a key way for me. While the staff is friendly and the lobby inviting, the elevators, hallways, and rooms are tired and in need of some serious refreshing. The room was fairly large for NYC but everything from carpets to bed covers to the bathroom needs to be repaired, replaced, or refreshed. There are far more comfortable options nearby. It's an incredible spot, but far from spotless.",2,1
"Overall customer service was pleasant.  Front desk - Pasquale - was very helpful, friendly and pleasant.  The hotel needs major renovations. The decor was nice but the mezzanine and lobby area furniture was noticeably worn.  My room was relatively clean, but the walls were dirty, wallpaper stained and peeling. The Roman shades was heavily stained.  Also, everything in the room had a steep price attached. Nothing was complimentary, even the coffe and tea in the room had a price-tag.  Also, the room was very cold. The heating/air conditioning unit was noisy and did not warm the room.  We had the temperature set on 80 degrees and the room was still cold.  I notified the front desk, was told it would be fixed, but it was not fixed.  Me and my family had a cold stay at this hotel.",2,1
"Location was amazing! I was working at Alice Tully Hall and I could not have asked for a more convenient spot. The building/block full of just what I needed. There was a big Duane Reed down stairs for last minute things I forgot and snacks. A Starbucks literally out the door for my grab and go breakfast. PJ Clarks out the door to the other side to sit for an easy (yet expensive) burger. Rosa Mexicana around the block for a catch up margarita, chips and fresh guac with the work team. The little plaza across the street with a few tables and chairs was a great waiting/meeting spot. The fish restaurant in the building was even quite enjoyable for a more upscale bite to celebrate at the end of the project.  HOWEVER, the hotel needs a refurbish. My fourth floor room was down a long",2,1
"We stayed at empire hotel for 5 days for the first stage of our honeymoon, during Christmas Holidays. The hotel is in a good position to visit NYC but that's the only advantage as we weren't satisfied at all with the room and the service.  The concierge at the check-in confirmed our room was prepaid by our travel agent, BUT debited instead the 150$deposit the WHOLE AMOUNT of the room on our credit card ""by mistake"" and justified himself with an error in their system: a couple of tickets for free drinks and breakfast was their only form of excuse, and we had to arrange for solution of the problem on our own. You can immagine the inconvenience caused. I know humans do make mistakes but these inconvents just should not happen, and should definitely be treated in a different way.",1,1

There is a problem with everything in this hotel . The only good thing I can say about this hotel was my checkin process, the girl at the desk was professional and accommodating, other than that, the service from housekeeping to room service to everyone else we interacted was terrible . They charge for Internet in room & they don't have fridge or microwave, even for a charge . The TV wasn't working a couple times . We ordered movie & it took calling 2 maintenance guys and a couple time turning off and on . We ordered room service, the people answering the call are not well informed about what comes with the order, I am",1,1
"Hotel looked nice online. When you arrive, lobby, reception and even lifts are all clean and look nice. When you get into the rooms though, wallpaper coming off, door lock in the bathroom was broken, and generally a bit shabby. They don't provide Internet in the rooms, which is a bit misleading, as online it says they do. When you get there you find out it's only available for free in the lobby, and you need to pay if it's in the room. Not stated online + very annoying when trying to plan a trip. It was also very expensive to buy anything in the hotel. Drinks were 15 dollars+, with tip and tax. In the room they're offering water for 8 dollars. Feel like they are trying to rip you off whilst charging you for it. Made sure I stayed out the hotel for a good 15 hours during the day.",2,1
"You can tell my general feeling of this hotel by the title, but I will start out with the one good thing...the  hotel's location. It's less than a minute walk to a major subway line (the 1 train), as well as across the street from beautiful Lincoln Center, restaurants, and a short walk to Central Park. Unfortunately for us, this is where the good stopped. This yet another Priceline received hotel, which they claim is 4 stars. However, this is yet another property that seems to have put much more into its look than the actual quality of the hotel.    The first issue, was the outrageous mandatory $150 incidental deposit required to check in. Not surprisingly, the room didn't even have $150 worth of amenities. This high amount was for a 2-night stay. Then, the queen room we were",2,1
"My wife and I stayed here for 4 days in November, and whilst there was nothing particulary wrong with the hotel there was also nothing great about it. Upon arrival we were quickly checked in and sent on our way to our room. The main hallways and communal areas were extremely hot and in poor repair. Once in our room, considering it was a king superior it wasn't particulary large, and had a view of the AC units out the back of the hotel. Trying to get the room to a comfortable temperature was a struggle, and if you wanted anything like a coffee in your room that was extra. The design of the shower wasn't great as it flooded the bathroom, however the shouwer itself was the highlight of the room.  Overall if it wasn't for the fact that we were both so exhausted from walking round",2,1
"I've stayed at the Empire three times - first two were unremarkable and were over five years ago.  I don't know how a hotel goes downhill so fast, but this one has.  Paint is chipping, bedding torn and decor in common areas in very sad state.  The heat could not be adjusted or turned off and this even though the unit in the room was unplugged.  In the morning, due to problems with the elevators, many guests in the hallway discussed how truly comfortably hot their rooms had been, so I know it wasn't just ours.  As for those elevators, it took ten minutes to get down the lobby. To top things off, there was maintenance being done in the room next door -- starting at 8 am with power tools on full throttle.    One other note - upon checking in, we were greeted without eye contact,",1,1

"Our party of ten (including my blind Father) arrived at this hotel for just a one night stay and have to say that the male receptionist, Pascal, was so rude and unhelpful. He had a very un-pleasant manner, was impatient, tutted at us and was rolling his eyes. We booked in with another member of staff earlier that morning (Rudi), who was lovely and very helpfull- who told us only 2 of our 5 allocated rooms were available. So, we went out for the day and when we came back that afternoon, was unfortunate enough to be served by this rude man who made a drama out of things. Our previously given room numbers had changed unbe known to us which confused matters, but his rudeness did not help. This was not our fault.  Our new rooms were small, shabby and overlooking lots of air",1,1

Our first room was 412 which can only be described as a box room with a view of a wall facing with a loud generator located outside. I returned with my partner to reception and insisted we speak to a different member of staff after being so badly treated prior. The receptionIst knew exactly what we were talking about so the previous elder gentlemen receptionist must have known the room he put us in ,she said we could have a different",1,1
"Hotel is in a great Lincoln Center location - close to subway, Time Warner, UWS, Midtown, etc.  We did a ""stay cation"" and opted for a suite so our son would have a private area to sleep.  I emailed with the hotel ahead of time, and was told pool would be open, heated, etc.  Pool is more like a jacuzzi in size, has no sunlight despite being on the roof and is definitely not heated.  It would have to be 100+ degrees to be warm enough to use.  In my pre stay emails, I also emphasized that we needed a crib and small refrigerator plugged in before our arrival so it would already be cool.  Hotel fridges seem to take hours to cool down which does not help when you have milk for the baby.  Nothing was in the room upon arrival, had to call.  And call. And call.  And call.  And go down",1,1
"I was very disappointed in the room, it was so small, not fancy at all, and felt claustrophobic in it. The bed is very hard, so for me, was not comfortable.   This was a trip for my daughter's birthday and she was disheartened by it as well. NOTHING fancy about the room we had except the headboard was nice.",2,1
"Although in a great location, this hotel leaves much to be desired.  It could do with a complete makeover or failing that, a good clean.  The rooms, the bathrooms and the closets are all way too small (nowhere to hang an overcoat).  The free WiFi is only available in the lobby lounge where there are never any seats.  WiFi in your room will cost you 12 dollars per device per 24hours.  Would not recommend.",2,1
"My husband and i stayed in room 236 on Dec 2nd, 2015, for one night and we DO NOT recommend this hotel!!!   I have to say that the location is relatively central and the lobby entrance and the room itself initially looked nice, but when I went into the bathroom there were cockroaches (both in the evening and in the morning...).  We reported this to housekeeping, but the best they could say was ""we'll send someone in the morning."". Unfortunately, no one showed up in the morning.  Immediately after we checked out, I started to get terrible itchy legs and now have about 20 bed bug bites that are very itchy and infected.  I have been to seen my doctor twice and he has prescribed me 3 medications which I am now taking.  Also, there is an EXTREMELY loud generator at about the 5th or",1,1
"I was here for a one-night stay.  My room, which was small, was poorly designed.  The wall-mounted television interfered with the light meant for the desk, making it somewhat unpleasant to work at the desk because of the insufficient lighting.  But here is why I gave the hotel a bad review.  At night I noticed that the sink drain was partially clogged, resulting in a backup of water when I tried to use it.  In the morning, I discovered that the valve for the overhead shower did not work, which resulted in requiring the use of a hand-held shower head.  This would have been okay except that part of the shower enclosure was designed to be open and the hand-held shower head resulted in water going all over the bathroom.  So I barely used it.

"The staff here are helpful and housekeeping is good thanks again to the staff BUT this hotel is really expensive even by Manhattan terms ($380!/night) and the rooms are tired and need of basic repainting.  Linens are basic. Room sizes are unusually small (you cannot extend your arms in the bathrooms without touching either walls as the bathrooms are SO tiny. Hotel-supplied toiletries are basic. I expected more luxury in my stay given the nightly rate.  a standard coffee pod is $2.50 in the room and there is no complimentary water...just a weirdly basic hotel experience at a luxe price. The owners are lucky to have such capable staff...it would be great if more of the profits could remain in the hotel redirected to guest room quality. The main draw is proximity to Lincoln centre,",1,1
"My son and I spent one night here in December because we had an early morning event close by. I couldn't have spent more than one night here.  I chose this hotel because of it's close proximity to the event we were attending but also because it was one of the more *reasonably* priced hotels in the area.  We arrived at night and ordered room service ($22 for a cheeseburger...which is fine. We expect prices like that in New York City.) and planned to retire early as we needed to be up and out early in the morning. When we entered our room it was HOT. Ridiculously hot. I immediately went to the heating/cooling unit and put it on as high and cool as possible. It barely sputtered. I attempted to contact the front desk four times. All four times, the phone rang and rang and rang. At",2,1
"When booking a Hotel in New York unless you are prepared to spend BIG bucks (more than $600 a night) you have to make some compromises. For the price of a 5* hotel in most other cities in America/Europe, you get, at best, a 3* hotel.   I'll start with the good points: The Beds are comfortable. It's very well located for the upper west side.  Now the bad points:  We had decided to splash out and book a Junior Suite. Number one point: NO CLOSET. There was a hole in the wall covered by a curtain within which was also the safe and the minibar. This meant that jackets could not hang straight down. There were also only two small drawers to keep all your clothes in. Also we had no daylight - the room overlooked an interior space - you had to crane your neck to see the sky.  The Air",2,1

Not cheap to stay here, so the least they should do is leave you to sit in the bar ( after being on your feet since early morning)  should you wish without plying yourself with drinks all night for the fun of it.

In addition to this he surprised me with a stay at the empire hotel, knowing I was a major gossip girl fan in its heyday!! I could not contain my excitement on all levels.  Upon arrival to the hotel I was impressed  with the lobby area. We checked in and the receptionist made conservation by asking how our stay so far has been in NYC, obviously beaming with joy I advised her we had gotten engaged, the receptionist dismissed our news and gave us our room key and left us to it.

There was no vanity in the bathroom at all - no space to put your makeup bag or toothbrush. It was just a large sink. Good location, very close to central park. The room was very loud, the windows were to thin and didn't keep much sound or temperature out. The WiFi is a joke - $10 USD per 24 hours per device!

The air conditioning  did not adequately  cool the room so it was hot and stuffy; this made it very difficult to get any sleep. This morning we had no hot water; the desk clerk said a pipe had burst. Our overnight experience was pretty hard to accept; we are hoping that the hotel will refund the fee for our stay because we would stay there again since our daughter lives 2 blocks away; we won't, however, if our problems are not addressed.We tried to contact the manager by phone but just kept getting  passed around and we were never connected to anyone in authority.",2,1

Positives: -great location, right next to Lincoln Centre, Columbus Circle, Central Park (south), and all tourist attractions such as Times Square and the Empire State Building are about 20 minutes walk.  -the hotel lobby is stunning, great for photos, drinks and free WIFI (lobby area only) Negatives: -charge for WIFI per device in your room, in one of the major cities in the world and nearing 2016, this is just unacceptable for a 4*",2,1

The hotel is on the Upper West Side with a short walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, and pretty much anything else you would want to see while visiting NYC. Additionally, the interior design and structure of the hotel are gorgeous. The rooftop lounge, as I mentioned, is so much fun! It's always pretty crowded with good music and fun people.

We also found the pool is now closed, it would have been nice to have been told this as we checked in not while we were standing in our pool gear in front of the delivery men.

We booked the junior suite thinking it would be spacious but the pokey bathroom has a shower with no closing screen, so the bathroom floor is a pool of water and the toilet and toilet paper get soaked. And the view is of a brick wall opposite. All round pretty unimpressed.",2,1
"The Empire is in a great location right next to Central Park, the Lincoln Centre and 10 minutes walk from Times Square, but that must be offset by the fact that the rooms are very tired and the whole hotel is in real need of a facelift.  We stayed for three nights in late August, having arrived from Boston and then going on to a cruise to Bermuda. We chose the Empire as our both our girls loved the ‘Gossip Girl’ connection, and the rooftop terrace and pool were an attraction.  The entrance lobby and stairs are fine and the staff are great, but it all goes down hill when you get to the rooms.  We had two inter-connecting rooms and couldn’t believe what a shabby state they were in. Apart from being quite small, both bathrooms had tiles hanging off, doors didn’t open, air-con units",2,1

"The Rooms are way too small and too dark! No Free Wi-Fi, what is really a joke, I ask for a 6 day fee, and they wanted 70$ for Wifi, what a rip-off. Wi-Fi in the lobby was free, but after there are more than 20 people logged-in, you can´t connect anymore. High-price, low service... will never go back there!",2,1
"The location of the Empire Hotel is great. Right beside the Lincoln Center. But it is a small and old hotel. It looks like it has been refurbished but the essential is still in need of some improvements. The elevators are terrible and so is the breakfast restaurant. The room is very small but well decorated. Ours didn't have a closet, just a small rack. The bathroom is also very, very small, but the shower is good. By the way it's door was cracked. I expected a nicer place, although we had a nice and calm stay.",2,1
"We have stayed in the Empire again in nov 2014 and jan 2015. We tend to go back(we have stayed six times here) because of the location and the frequent presence of the property in the Priceline website deals. But exactly there, lies the problem: if you get there with a Priceline booking they will always send you to a matchbox room that cannott fit two human beings by any chance and that is really very far from any 4 star hotel standards. We fight it everytime, and it always is a pain to have to deal with bad attitude reception desk people and a having to talk to a condescending manager before getting a regular room. Now we have finally got tired and moved our business to Nylo, a few blocks up.",2,1

If it were not for the front desk staff, especially Ms. Katya, and the travel agent at bookit.com we would have checked out two days early. Rooms are in disrepair and not very clean. Elevators broke down. Management needs to give this place some attention such as replace burned out light bulbs, fix sink stoppers, replace worn out chairs, fix broken curtain rods, and at the very least offer free in-room coffee and tea even if they have to to increase the rate by $3.00 a night.

"Stay as a guest for the first time with my daughter. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Reasons being the housekeeping standards are extremely poor.....we arrived to our room with visible stained toiled seat, noticible cobweb above our bed, peeling wallpaper throughout. Even when upgraded the standards were not much iimproved. The images on the website are truly misleading. Our concerns were reported immediately upon arriveable and there is no malice in this review.  Alot of work to be done to raise standards!!!  Forgot to mention our room was right next to where the hotel held parties for the public.",1,1

"I came to this Hotel 3 years ago.  And I didn't like.  Can't say I like it more.  Design is nice, staff is friendly, location is great.  But... The hotel is noisy as possible.  Street view, you will suffer Broadway traffic.  Court view, you will feel the vibrations of all HVAC units in your bed and still hear the traffic.   Breakfast is nice but stupidly expensive.  8$ for Evian when you can by at DR (15m) for 2$.  I honesty don't want to say it's a bad place but I would suggest finding something else.  (You may want to avoid the Columbus 6 because it's globally the same thing.)  Sorry guys, but I take an hotel to sleep.  In 3 nights I hardly slept more than 10h total. Not good for business.",2,1
"Stayed here after a couple of nights at the Club Quarters Boston and at the Hilton New York Fashion district.  In comparison this hotel is over priced, has tiny rooms with barely enough space to open a suitcase. The majority of the tiny amount of space provided was occupied with mini bar items. Everything in the room including basic tea and coffee is an additional charge and really adding insult to injury the WiFi comes at an extra fee as well.  At a time when trains, Starbucks and some public parks have free WiFi this really isn't acceptable at all. The hotel lobby looks nice enough, but the rooms themselves are rather in need of repair and refurbishment. Definitely not a 4 star establishment, generously a low 3. Would not recommend.",2,1

I tis well done to attract your attention, perhaps to hide what is yet to be found when you are heading to your room.  We checked in on AUG 25th with our stay until AUG 30th, 2015.

In the room they do not even give complimentary tea and coffee. The concierge was awfull could not even book our shuttle ok for us we had 5 hours at the airport because of him we will be returning to New York but I would defiantly not stay at the Empire hotel Helene",1,1
"This is a bait and switch scheme through Priceline.  I bid on a 4 star hotel and got a 2 star room.  The hotel staff switched our room after complaining, but gave us the exact same room only on the first floor (vs. the 3rd floor).  When explaining that I bid on a 4 star hotel, the manager explained that this wasn't a 4 star hotel, and that it's Priceline's fault for selling us that room.  They offered to upgrade us for $30 a night.  I refused.  They finally put us in an ""upgraded room"" after two failed attempts to make us happy.  When we arrived in the room I came to discover there is no internet.  What's the deal with hotels and no internet?  No signal on my phone either-- so you're pretty much screwed if you need to work.

"The Empire Hotel has a fabulous location, steps away from Lincoln Center. But aside from location, it was a disappointment for $420+ a night (with NYC taxes and other fees). Tiny rooms with 2 uncomfortable double beds, dark and outdated decor and minuscule bathroom, $8 bottles of Evian and $3 cups of coffee IN the room made me glad that we were staying for 1 night only. The 'pool' on the rooftop is postage-stamped size; it's maybe 15 feet long and 4 feet wide, so more of a plunge pool than a pool. Had that feeling that NYC takes advantage of its tourists. Wish we had found something else and will be glad to move on. Best to do your research on Trip Advisor before booking anything in Manhattan as there are much nicer hotels in this price range.",2,1
"The hotel was extremely overpiced for what it offered.  Pictures on the website are very decieving.  The rooms smell musty, carpets are dark and dirty and rooms are extremely small you cant even keep your suitcase on the floor.

"Nice enough hotel, good location.  Tiny rooms but not unexpected given its NYC.  The most disappointing aspect was the variable service.  On arrival after a 10 hour journey the receptionist was the least welcoming I've ever met, a little rude in fact.  We also had breakfast served by someone who seemed to look down his nose at us.  But then we also had great service in the bar, a different waiter on a different day at breakfast and the concierge was awesome (I think his name was Dennis - Empire if you are reading this - he's your best asset).  Pool is tiny too.",2,1

A/C rattled all night, bathroom sink was clogged, shower floods the bathroom if you aren't careful, corroded window frames, corroded and cracked shower corners, etc. For NYC, its OK, but on principal, it isn't OK. Overpriced food and beverage traps are laid throughout the room: $3 coffee, $8 water bottles, a fridge packed with $$$$ booze and chasers, a desk packed with $$$$$$ snacks.  Avoid.   Pool Deck: Good views of Broadway. The pool itself is really small. Pool Staff - for the most part, the runners were friendly and did a good job picking up cups and running food orders out, but unfortunately, the Food & Bev Team in charge is incredibly unprofessional and will try to push you to reserve spaces/seats",1,1
"This hotel represents extremely poor value. The rooms themselves are dark and in need of refurbishing as they appear very dated (e.g. wallpaper peeling off, ripped bedding).  The service in both the pool bar and the restaurant is very slow; having tried to order at both these venues we eventually gave up after waiting 20 mins to simply be served.  The most insulting aspect was on arrival in the room a bottle of water (unchilled) is placed at each bedside cabinet for a mere 8 dollars! After an 11 hour trip I found this particularly rude. Most of the room amenities require an extra fee (wifi - which you have to pay for per device). In sum, a very disappointing hotel stay.",1,1

We only noticed when we reached our next destination - we called the hotel several times and had conversations with different members of staff, but no one was particularly keen to help. They eventually checked the lobby area and our rooms and declared that the bag was nowhere to be found. They would not check their CCTV to see if they could spot anyone leaving with our bag, and when we asked whether they had had any other bags stolen from the hotel, they put the phone down on us. They advertised that they had a pool but it was never open while we were there. They also advertised a gym",2,1

"As a major ballet lover, The Empire Hotel has, for the past 30 years, been my go-to abode, as it is perfectly situated across the street from Lincoln Center. Even when the place went 'upscale' and almost doubled it's prices - and darkened it's lobby - 7 or 8 years ago, I paid the piper to stay at my favorite hotel. Sadly, I will never stay there again due to a terrible incident last month with a very arrogant waitress at the lobby bar. After a ballet performance, I decided to have a nice drink in the bar area before heading up to my room. The waitress saw me coming and sitting at one of the cozy plush sofas but did not come to me for 10 minutes, preferring to gab with the guy behind the bar. Finally she came and said ""would you like to order something?"" I said, ""yes, may I see",2,1

A medium-sized bottle of water cost 8 dollars.There are other hotels in the same price range that are much better values--the Sofitel, for example.

"After checking in,and trying to get a elevator to work we entered our room,we booked a superior double, but the first problem we noticed was the terrible noise coming from a very large generator, The sound was deafening! We spoke to reception and they told us that the Hotel was fully booked...Wrong, we left the room and went down to reception. They allocated us another room, on a different floor facing the street, the sound of traffic was considerably better than the noise coming from the generator. The bathroom was very basic and needs a facelift ASP. A very run down Hotel but in a great position,also a great disappointment was the rooftop bar and pool area which was closed, except for a evening doo. For over 300 guests. Would we stay there again ....not a chance",2,1
"First of all, the staff were very kind and accommdating. The location of the hotel can't be beat. And while it certainly is not the worst hotel experience, for the price of the room, I was definitely expecting more. For a hotel that certainly must bring in a lot of money, I was hoping for better. It feels it hasn't been updating in decades. There is a musty smell; the icebox in the room had made the carpet wet from leaking; the shower tile looked dirty because it needs updating; the bed was terribly uncomfortable; on the rooftop deck (which has beautiful views), there were loose tiles. I'd go back in a heartbeat if I heard they had renovated.",2,1
"Extremely dissapointed with the room. the suites were not accomodating, I have stayed at less expensive hotel and much nicer. we were celebrating a 40th birthday of a friend in the city and needed a place to stay.",1,1
"Sadly, the only reason I am giving this hotel 1 star is because of the location.  It is located directly across the street from Lincoln Center.  Outside of that, the entire experience was terrible.  The receptionist was very rude when I checked in, the room was fine - nothing spectacular for the price you are paying and clearly very old.  Things were broken and the room was in poor shape.  The air conditioning unit under the window was very loud and cooled very poorly.  We had two double beds so the person next the ac was frozen all night while the person on the other side of the room was hot.  The ""fitness room"" was a joke.  Located in the basement where no one could see or hear you (kind of like going to a dungeon), dark, hot, and all of the equipment was broken.  The",1,1
Well presented foyer and warm welcome. The room is basic with just the minimal amenities I would describe the room as stuffy and uncomfortable with minimal amenities which require repair. There is access to NYC attractions- however I would not go back.,2,1
wow.....really a terrible experience!!!! I would definitely never recommend this hotel.  Location is ok and the outside of the hotel looks pretty grand.  But then....the room was the size of a shoebox. The bathroom was so small that one could not sit on the toilet without having the knees knocking on the wall. The faucet is so close to the bottom of the sink that you can not wash your hands without having to wiggle them around to wash them! The blanket is so thin that you will need to ask for another one if you want to avoid turning on the (extremely old and noisy) heater.  Checkin staff is grouchy and really not nice.  The business center offers printers at a cost but expect to be charged for a defective printer!  A terrible experience.,1,1
"lifts broken, bar ok, rooms small, rooms need tlc, dark, dingy, wifi ok, good location, a/c units loud and old, rough rough rough.  I had a room overlooking nothing (that's a good thing in NYC as it means peace, well apart from the a/c unit). Must try harder.",2,1
"Stayed here for 4 nights in May.  Rooms reasonable size for NY and showers not bad at all.  Position good too - near park and restaurants.  Plaudits end there however.  The interior of the hotel is one of those dark brown, dim light affairs - that are designed so to hide the age and grime and general tatt.   One morning no hot water in the hotel had to resort to a cold shower - ouch!  Internet access poor and expensive.  In the room is a plethora of goodies for sale - beer, wine, snacks etc.  But the price is a joke - small bottle of water $8.  Bottle of average red wine $75!!  Who buys this stuff? There are better hotels around.",1,1
We stayed at the empire about 6 months ago to go to Lincoln center.  The location is great but the hotel room needs much improvement.  While the size of the room was acceptable the condition of the bathrooms was not it was dirty there was mold on the curtain and the furniture was very dated and needs an update. We are returning again at the end of May because of the location and hoping for an improvement of the room conditions.  Elevators have a very long wait time,2,1
"If you like extra firm mattresses, in room coffee which you have to pay for, no delivery of newspaper, absence of robes, and no bathtub, then this is the hotel for you. For the same price we prefer the Beacon Hotel",1,1
"Room in the hotel is tiny (even by NY standards).  The room smells and the bathroom has mildew on the wall.  They charge extra for everything.  Even the business center charges you to print tickets.  We went to a bar for a drink and couldn't get service for 30 minutes.  The AC is insufficient for the room and it isn't even summer.  It was 45 degrees outside, we had the AC on max cold and it was still too warm in the room.",1,1

"Stayed last minute for a night, purchased off a travel website, when my flight was cancelled.  This place has seen better days and is not worth even the discounted prices.  Literally everything it's worn and chipped and stained.  From the chipped front desk to tattered amd stained drapes in the lobby to the wrinkles in the carpet in the halls to the threadbare velvet chair in the room to the outdated tv.  No internet. Pay for everything including a cup of Keurig coffee in the room. Wobbling toilet. Two paper cups is all you get. No real welcome from staff. Clearly an iconic property in a great location that has been let go. Cant wait to leave.",1,1
"Booked my stay in early November for a stay in February - locked in my rate, which was expensive but albeit it was central to Lincoln Center for fashion week. Upon checking in was not given anything to sign or review for my rate - leaving me to assume the confirmation I received back in November would be somewhat accurate allowing for applicable taxes and fees. Room was extremely small for rate, wi-fi was outrageously expensive and did not work in my room and the free wi-fi downstairs did not work either. Upon checking out received a folio with charges for more than double what I was quoted on my initial reservation confirmation. Immediately asked the front desk clerk to speak with the front desk manager or general manager on my bill and was told neither were available and that",1,1
"I was quite excited to stay at the Empire Hotel as I've heard great things about it online. I was extremely disappointed with my experience. The rooms were small which I didn't mind so much. The air conditioner however was right in front of my bed and for whatever reason we woke up each morning with the edge of the bed extremely moist or wet. When I called the front desk to explain the situation their response to me was.. ""You should had let us know earlier"". I also mentioned the fact that our air conditioner was extremely loud. It would make a loud engine-like sound all throughout the night as we kept it on. Again, when I mentioned this to the receptionist she insisted that I should had informed them earlier. I ended up sleeping on the floor in the hotel for 3 nights because of",1,1
The room we had was small. The maid did not replenish supplies. And this was the first time for me that there was a charge for in room coffee that I've seen. What next? A charge for towels? But the location is great.,1,1
"I came to NYC to celebrate my 40th birthday. While here, I also got engaged. My thoughtful girlfriend had flowers shipped and delivered to the hotel at 5:00am this morning, but they arrived to our room at 7pm. When they arrived, after we finally called to ask where the flowers were, they were damaged. All of the other places we have visited in NYC have excelled in special occasions, really making this trip memorable. Sadly, this hotel does not do a good job. We had a long wait (without an early check in) when we got in a yesterday because the computers were down. The staff was luke warm and lacked empathy about the wait time. Today the elevators were broken. The hotel itself is fine. The location is fine, but it is just NOT a hotel which cares about memorable experiences.",2,1
"Your rooms are extremely small for your high rates...everything is over-priced, charging for Wi-Fi is insulting, given what you charge, and one of the elevators was not functioning when I left, which made me late for my shuttle ride",2,1
"For a fancy hotel-it was not worth the cost. Noisy, staff not ver friendly. Room and bathroom very small. $12.95 for wifi. $3.00 for in room coffee. Fees for everything-not what you expect from a ""luxurious"" hotel.",2,1
"they have not kept up with updates.  my shower had no door making the bathroom a puddle.  the internet is very expensive, and yet kept cutting off.  i ended up having to used my own phone and data plan despite having paid the premium internet package.",2,1
"1. No wifi in rooms, you have to go down to lobby to use it or pay $13pd for room wifi 2. The window in my room was not well sealed- so the noise and cold draft came through and I got sick. These windows are of lowest standard for a hotel. 3. It is on a very busy and noisy business district corner so ask for a room on the quiet side not with what they call ""a view"" of the main street. This hotel might be okay for a night or two and for business ppl, but I would not recommend this for tourists. The only good thing about their service was that when we wanted to leave earlier than our booking (because I wanted to change hotels) they made it easy.",1,1

The front desk says nothing is available and he puts me the ""smallest room"" they have, and yes once I walk in, I was VERY disappointed.  The room is so tiny, the bath room I can barely close the door.  The shower was not properly cleaned, someone's razor cover was still on the floor!!  Ugh.  Very over-rated hotel in my opinion.  I had stayed many hotesl in NY but this size and price is something not to be justified.  I would not recommend this hotel to my friends, or colleagues.",2,1
Flat beer on a champagne budget. the only thing that could be considered a positive was we didn't get bedbugs. The sink didn't drain. The overhead shower didn't work. The hand held did but practically impossible not to flood the room as the door was nonexistent.,1,1
The room was badly in need for a update. Bathroom is really small. Bathroom door was broken. Tables and furniture were badly worn. Wallpaper was peeling. I just plain out expected more. Hope there is a revamp soon.,2,1
"A great location but the shabbiness and disrepair of the facility is hard to take, The greatest complaint was the excessively slow elevators, lack of elevator floor indicators and tiny bathrooms in the regular rooms. The lobby and hallways need a major cosmetic upgrade.",1,1
"The room itself was okay, but the bathroom is far too small. The beds are firm, not very comfortable, not enough blankets. Booking through Trip Advisor was a disaster b/c the rep book one of our rooms direct and the other through Expedia, the promised special rate was not applied to both rooms. I called and spoke with someone for several minutes, but she could not help me. Very disappointing. I will never use this service again.",2,1
"I stayed there and paid full rate. I will not stay there again. They gave be a room that had a tub that had caulking sloppily applied, the grout in the shower was dirty or missing, the shower curtain was too short and billowed and touched me when I showered (GROSS) and it had a rain shower head only. There was no hand held. Try getting soap off of your entire body with water source only from above and the water pressure was not one of those that could make up for the difference. I felt like I was staying at my blind, widowed uncle's house and just had to settle because that was the best he could do. NOT SO. This is supposed to be a nice hotel. AND --- I had electrical short in my room at 11:30pm and hand to get out of bed, get dressed, wait for maintenance and repeat this",1,1
DO NOT STAY IN THIS TYPE OF ROOM! It is literally a closet. Cannot even fit two people. Insanely hot even with AC. Bed is super small and uncomfortable. Do not recommend to anyone. This room is a joke.,1,1
"The location was perfect for our conference at the New York Society for Ethical Culture.  It has a lovely lobby, the front desk staff was good and the concierge was fantastic.  I'm not sure how it's rated 4 star.  My room was like a sauna and the roof top bar and outside noise were unbearable.  When I called the front desk at 4:00am to let them know my air unit was on cool (and off), yet it was still blowing out hot air, I was told, ""You know your windows open.  It's usually hot on your floor.""  The second evening was better as I learned to adjust the air by my window openings.  However, the windows being open made the road noise intolerable.  Luckily, they provided ear plugs... for no charge.  There was a charge for EVERYTHING else.  Even the Keurig coffee, $3.00.  The rooms",2,1

It was hard to sleep due to a continuous humming noise from outside which sounded like a large mine truck was parked right by the window (despite being on the 8th floor).

We were looking forward to a family reunion with several out of town relatives also staying at the Empire. The décor upon entering was lovely but the service at check in was frustrating due to woefully undertrained help. The rooms were small reminding me of European hotels but tastefully appointed and comfortable.  Once problem was finding room on surfaces to put things as the room was overstocked with outrageously overpriced snacks which  covered most services. When using the bathroom the back of the door was totally unfinished with bare splintered wood ,peeling paint and dirt in the corners.  The heating/cooling system was tastefully covered hiding an",1,1

Dont seem to care about guests or have any customer relations,1,1

I  stay at the Empire Hotel  many times a year as it is a hotel my employer list as a preferred client hotel.

Waited for bellman for 30 minutes to help me with my bag and never came. Had to lug 10 pieces of luggage down to the front door myself. When staff saw me instead of feeling shame and helping, they were rude and chastised me. How can you have only one bellman working who is also getting people cabs. Long lines for checking and out and getting packages from the bellman. They don't have enough staff to handle their guests. Overall horrible stay. When I complained, they offered nothing. Terrible experience.",1,1
"This hotel is advertised as 4*, how?? The rooms are tiny!!! Seriously small. A.queen room had 5 hangers and no.space for anything else. Literally no space people. Found a new insect crawling in the bathroom. The toilet kept on blocking for both reason at all. They also advertise free WiFi, which is a lie. You have to Pay. I went ahead an paid for it anyway only for it to not work anyway and I'm still waiting for my refund as I type! OK so the location is good if you want midtown hotel. But the edison on 47th street is the same price and 100% better. If you were thinking about booking here, don't. If you already have, tough look.",1,1

If you provide coffee making facilities, to charge for it is a chutzpah!  And $8 for a bottle of water on the bedside table - you have to be kidding! Paper cups instead of proper glasses and mugs just adds insult. How many stars do they claim to have? When will the hotel be refurbished?",2,1
"The Empire Hotel is across the street from Lincoln Center - After a long evening of opera conducted by Maestro Levine, who needs long intermissions,  imagine walking across the plaza and crossing one street to your hotel room. I imagine that its first floor is filled with light colors, photos and paintings of the performing arts, an area on the first floor set up for afternoon tea after a matinee, late night drinks. Each hotel guest floor has a theme -  How about a few afternoon nutcracker teas?  The hotel experience extends the entire Lincoln Center experience, you make a reservation for your next ballet, concert, theatre weekend even before you check out.  Got the vision?

Driving home we noticed that all the money in the glove compartment was gone and items from our bags were missing.     It truly is an elegant location but the staff turns it into a dive. They have absolutely no sense of propriety or style. They referred to me as Pal and Bud. I didn't spent seven years in medical school to be called bud.

I stayed in room 137 which really only had its size to recommend it. The room was very noisy with blowers outside of the window creating a loud white noise the entire night. The heating system made very loud knocks when it heated up, and desperately needs to be replaced. Several buttons on its control panel were not functioning. When I arrived at the room after the first day out, the bath matt had not been replaced, and the toilet not cleaned.

The heating/air conditioning system itself is extremely NOISY, and the windows are very cheap and drafty, so if you value any sort of tranquility, definitely look elsewhere. In addition to all this, half of the elevators don't work at any given time, the staff are extremely unprofessional and nasty, and the management is completely unresponsive.

Hotel in very poor condition of repair was certainly not worth the money we spent will not be returning and I advise no one else too.  We had no heat in the room the tv remote did not work the shower would not stay upright.

However, the front desk staff was exactly the opposite. Apparently the front desk staff loved to have their faces in the computers and not assisting guests.They were also cold, rude, and not accommodating. I am a Hhonors Manager at Embassy Suites in Baltimore Maryland and not seeing one front desk agent not smile is unbelievable.   Although the room was beautiful and I enjoyed the waterfall shower, the worst part was that it felt like a Sauna. I called down to have engineering come look at HVAC. He checked the HVAC and said the pipes were still blowing hot air, so he turned them off. That did not help at all. We went to the front desk",1,1

The doorman were really helpful with getting cabs etc and alway really friendly.  Breakfast was nice, but the staff a bit hit and miss. Which was much like my impression of the hotel overall.

We were downgraded and promised a room on a higher floor with a view since we were waiting but instead we were given a room on the 4th floor which had a view of the side of Lincoln Center which was fine except for the noise.

"I would never recommend this hotel to anyone, it was an AWFUL experience with horrible service and amenities. The room was about 85 degrees and nothing would cool it down. Bathroom was deplorable, half of the shower door was missing - useless.",1,1
"The fun begins before you check in. I tried to extend my stay and wanted the same rate for the extra days.  . .all too hard for their reservations person who promised faithfully to call me back, but didn't . . then when  I called back 8 hours later some other guy put me on hold until the line dropped out. I did manage to make the reservation . . and specifically asked for a room which didn't come with the sounds of police sirens, garbage trucks and jack hammers (how about double glazing those windows to keep out some of the noise from the four corners of the world?). It was booked. . .  but alas on arrival I had been ""upgraded"" to a room with the noise - if you do stay here take ear plugs.   On the positive side - the rooms, for New York, are a good size. Unfortunately, Boogie",2,1
"I stayed at the Empire on business and while my stay was only confirmed 2 days before arrival I have stayed at other hotels where they have rolled out the Welcome committee at shorter notice!  The hotel; the reception, bar and lobby area have this wannabe 50s movie theatre theme going on, lots of velvet and animal print, could do with investing in some more lights after a sunny stroll around Central Park its pretty dark to walk in to. The location; Location was great, uptown enough that it doesn't feel once you walk outside there are thousands of people waiting to bump into you. Lincoln Centre, Juilliard, Central Park all within a block radius. Great cafes and restaurant within walking distance on Columbus including Magnolia Bakery (2). Columbus circle and Grom a couple blocks",2,1
"Good location, disappointing atmosphere, ripped, warn chairs, couches, bathroom shower head DID NOT work, so had to use handheld. Beds were decent. Suite were ok size, normal rooms were VERY small. food was good and service in restaurant was great!",2,1
"The hotel staff are are charming and helpful, friendly and efficient.  The location is near perfect.  The rooms though are tiny, but the most important things is that they are run-dawn.  In my latest stay, the curtains were stained, the flooring was filthy at corners and seams, the window ledge is truly disgusting.  The furniture is cracked, and nicked and in need of replacement.  Bed is comfortable but whole gestalt makes one worry about cleanliness,  Overall, you are paying for the location and the rooms themselves pretty awful-- in need of repair and complete renovation.  On top of that they charge for the in-room coffee.",2,1
"The hotel has a great location, however upon our check-in I was under the impression I'd have a king size bed once we were checked in we received a queen size needless to say my husband is 6'7 and we needed the space. Once I asked for a room with a King size bed the employee told me "" this is all we have."" Now the problem I had with that is that upon staying a night and heading in I decided to ask for another face towel at the front after listening to another gentlemen being checked in I found that he was asked ""which floor he'd like to stay on, and which view he'd like"" wow none of those amenities were offered to me. As we asked for another face towel we were advised they'd have to bring the face towel up to our room which was a hustle for a tip. I've never stayed a hotel where",2,1
"Picked for its location really near Central Park, Museums and walking distance to Time Square etc.  Also as featured in Gossip Girl. The location is really good and staff are friendly and the roof terrace great.  But rooms are small, even for New York, it does feel run down but the real down side is the endless extras  - I have never been to a Hotel which charges $3 for an in-room coffee (never had to pay at any hotel before) plus having to pay for Wi-Fi and then only for one device!!! The whole room was full of extras with a price tag.   Overall the hotel gives the impression it is looking for every opportunity to fleece guests and that takes the edge of any stay",2,1
"We have a long history with this hotel---dating back to the time in the 80's when our children were at Columbia.  Although it was old at that time, the location was perfect.  This is our second experience in the 21st century.  It is obvious that they have tried to make this into a boutique type hotel. Frankly, it fails miserably.  For the first time ever we had to ask to change our room. The bathroom configuration was such that there was no way that an adult could stand in front of the sink to brush your teeth.  After about 4 hours they changed our room although the desk staff was not very pleasant. Now we were in a room that was smaller (if that was possible) but at least we could go into the bathroom and stand in front of the sink. Hard to imagine but our stay went downhill",1,1
"The Empire Hotel is a beautiful, contemporary, wonderfully located hotel with a great roof top bar over looking Columbus circle and The Lincoln Center. The double room was a great size (especially for a NYC hotel) and moderately clean... That is it for the pros. Cons:  The beds are incredibly hard, no flat sheets were on the beds, and the room was very hot (even with the air on in Dec). With two hair dryers plugged in our power blew in our room and had to sit in the pitch black until they came to fix it. Do not expect ANYTHING to be included in the price of your room (450.00+) not even coffee... One morning I paid the ridiculous 3.00 for a cup of in room coffee to find out there wasn't even cream and sugar! The entire hotels service staff is unorganized, rude, and unhelpful",2,1
"Expensive, in dire need of basic maintenance, noisy (not necessarily from street - from hotel housekeeping staff slamming doors), small rooms, and tiny furniture. Definitely not setup for the business traveler (tiny desk, no desk light, TV immediately above desk, and power outlets must be scrounged).  A saving grace was a mostly friendly front desk staff. Unfortunately,  their few smiling faces are not enough to ever get me to come back to the Empire.    BTW - heed the reviews about the limited and/or slow elevators at times. For the first few days I stayed there, it seemed that only 2 of 4 elevators were available at any one time. Don't get me started about all the space they take up with the overpriced snacks, water, and k-cups on the small desk OR the refrigerator full of",2,1
"The only goods -- great location, some friendly and helpful staff.  No door on shower, water all over bathroom so we kept piles of towels all over floors for our stay.  Dark, dreary, sketchy elevators, tiny uncom for table beds.  Fyi, definitely not Italian linens.  Needs to be gutted and renovated.  Of course when prime location is brought up to speed prices will soar....",1,1
"Our stay was pleasant, however two of the days were without hot water. The desk staff in the mornings were very understanding. The afternoon and evening crew acted as if they didn't know anything was wrong.  Communication between the hotel and the health club around the corner (where we were suppose to be able to shower) was none existent, and I ended up paying for my shower time. Reimbursed by the hotel, but still a hassle. The location was great, but I'd probably stay somewhere else next trip.",2,1
"Rating was so over rated. We were on the 1st floor above the lobby. Small closet with small refrigerator inside, so not much space to hang clothes. No dresser to put clothes in. Bathroom so small that shower glass only covered half of shower. Water was all over the floor. Tried to go to gym downstairs. Only way to get there was using a designated elevator. It was broken. Rumbling of air conditioner was outside our window. Had to wear earplug while sleeping.",1,1
"This hotel was a real disappointment for a number of reasons. 1) to make a cup of coffee in your room it costs $3, so $3 for a little coffee pod, into a paper cup. 2) fitness center is terrible -- tiny, no air, old equipment, and the basement smells terrible. 3) bathroom has no room to put anything at all. 4) product is run-down, chips and such throughout the room. 5) bar menu is terrible, nothing you would want to eat. 6) no room service after 10pm.  Would never recommend or stay again.",2,1
"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive room in New York, and found the Empire.  They ""upgraded"" me to a room that was slightly larger than the one I had been booked in. There was still barely enough room to move around. The shower did not work -- no water pressure and a weird hand-held nozzle that just dripped water. Cold water. Could not get it to warm up. Also the sink did not drain. Not worth the money I saved.",2,1
Some points: Room not ready at 3 pm check-in Nightmare decor in lobby and room Thay charge for the room coffee maker Room loaded with overpriced snacks and booze. Looks like a deli. Lobby restrooms are dirty.  Just forget about it....this place needs a total overhaul.,1,1
"We live in the area and stayed at the Empire because of on-going construction in our apartment.  I was surprised at the condition of the property - beaten up hallways and rooms.  All of the furniture in the room had small or large nicks and other damage.  The beds were uncomfortable, the bathroom was very oddly configured - with the toilet installed right next to the wall (less than a quarter inch between toilet and wall, while there was a foot and a half of space on the other side).  No shower door, just open space, minuscule toiletries (enough for one shower) - I didn't know that they made things that small.  There were so many other details missing from our room - at over $400 per night for a suite, I expected more.  There were no closets in our corner suite, only a very",2,1
"This is obviously an older hotel that has been remodeled. While they have done a nice job, there is still much to do.   Good Parts - Comfortable bed - Nice shower with rain head  Needs Improvement - Windows on the street side need to be replaced. Paper thin. You know its bad when you have ear plugs on your pillow - Extremely slow elevators that creak - Front desk staff is disorganized  I called down to get a quieter room on the interior and was told all Doubles are next to the elevator so I opted to stay in my room on the 3rd floor where the traffic noise was pretty disruptive. Thank God for the ear plugs.  I called down to the Front Desk to extend my stay. I was quoted a rate of $229. I wanted to use a new card so I came down the next morning to confirm. At that time I was told",2,1
"Nightmarish decor in lobby, mezzanine and room;truly cheesy and vulgar. Dirty and shabby public ladies' room, chipped paint everywhere, plastic furniture in room, shower with no curtain or door. It's really a crummy motel. And even if it weren't as I've described it, it's offensive that they CHARGE for coffee made with the mini-Keurig in the room. Hundreds for this tacky room and not even a free cup of coffee in the morning?  I dread another night in the Empire, but at least the bed is decent.",1,1
"The hotel ambiance is stunning, kind of like a nyc lounge.  The rooms are extremely small.  The room was really clean, but the wallpaper was peeling off the walls?  Fyi room service is pricey, sandwich, salad, a beer, and a water is 80.00.  Concierge was really friendly.  Overnight parking was reasonable for NYC, 48.00.  Hotel restaurant is nice and the food is amazing.",2,1
"Not free wifi in rooms and poor connection speed in rooms The lobby is like a disco, during all day the music is too loud you cannot maintain a normal meeting in the lobby. The hotel is getting older...",2,1
"I went in this hotel for the second time last month always on a business trip: the first time I was there my collegue and I we were quite satisfied about it (even if it has not a good quality for price rate) and we decided to come back but we had a very bad experience last time. The room was smaller compared to the previous time and quite dirty: I've even found a used napkins on the floor of our room! but the worst thing was the fact that the boiler of the hotel broke up and all the guests had to stay without hot water for two days! and at the reception they were assuring that the inconvenience would have been solved fast... well 2,5 days without hot water in winter time is not a short time! and the only thing the hotel has done was giving the guests the free entrance to a close",2,1
If you're looking for hotel that offers a good location but no hot water then the Empire is for you. We stayed three nights but only had hot watr one morning out of three. There seemed to urgency to resolve the issues. And the not so nearby gym  - the alternative offered - seemed to have a problem  with collapsing vagrants in the changing rooms. Nice!,1,1
"This is my second stay at the empire and 10th in Manhattan.Getting ripped off for supposedly using items in the room I didn't,bringing it to the front desks staff's attention ,writing them a letter ,all counts for nought. Don't promise what you cant deliver,don't rip people off,because they tell others!",1,1
"Rooms are small and cramped.  No frills. Decorations somewhat Spatan. We had a view of the inner aspect of the hotel, so no view. Bathroom is tiny.  Temperature control in the room was poor, pretty hot.  Charges for WiFi nonPremium is $12.95.  Coming into the hotel it was a line of people that we had to get by there waiting to go upstairs to a nightclub.",2,1
"Awful towels.  Stained furniture/blankets.  Slamming doors all day/night.  The worst bathroom and design for a shower you will ever see.  They charge $3+ for K-cups IN the room.  Internet service is spotty at best.  Other than the location and the friendliness of the staff, this property is horrendous.",2,1
"Priceline will not help or book another hotel if you have problems. Such as no hot water, elevators stop at every floor. Bottom line stay with no hot water or book another hotel on your own. No hot water or out in the cold. Than you have to fight for a refund.",1,1
"This hotel should not be rated as a 4*. We have stayed here twice before and it was 4* then but has declined over the years. Too small bathroom (smaller that those on a cruise ship) with no safety rail and mal-functioning bath faucets, toiletries are not replenished, no pen and a dinky pad for writing, no bathrobe, no slippers, $7.50 for a bottle of water, $3.50 for in room coffee. Rooms and corridors are dark and dismal, and lobby drafty. This hotel is not worth the price. Ideal location, but that is all. I cannot recommend this hotel.",2,1
"Your Review  Low cost. benefit ; the rates are too high if you see the hotel facilities. The room is dark, the bathroom is very small and cleaning not the first priority. The positive aspect is the localization which is perfect.",2,1
We were charged the incorrect amount for our stay at least 4 different times throughout the stay. Also charged duplicate amounts several times. Make sure you check your bank account throughout your stay and after check out as well. Also heard at least 5 other guests complaining about incorrect charges. Also staff was not friendly at all except for one doorman who went on vacation after the first night. There are plenty of other hotels in the area with similar pricing and much nicer staff. Do not stay here unless you like being ignored by the staff and charged the wrong amount repeatedly throughout your stay.,1,1
"A broken boiler does not qualify as a natural disaster, yet the hotel treated it like once it happen they were no longer responsible for the comfort of their guests. After 2 days w/o hot water, in chilly fall weather I was told I could shower at the gym down the street. This was another logistics nightmare that could have been avoided had the hotel walked thru the process as if they were a guest of the hotel. Mass confusion and a waste of a morning.  One morning I used hot water from the Keurig coffee maker to at least have a hot wash cloth - that's when I felt like I was camping. I stayed a total of 7 days over a period of 10 days. First room internet connection was good. 2nd room it was terrible - if you're traveling on business you'd go out of your mind trying to send and",2,1
"My dad, sister, and I are all moving to New York and are staying here for 5 days until we get our place to live. This hotel is nice and modern and beautifully decorated. But their service is the worst I have ever witnessed in my life and I travel a lot so I've been to a lot of hotels. This hotel has terrible service and charges expensive and unnecessary fees for little tiny things such as cleaning and having a trained animal. Terrible service, not worth the decor. Not to mention that paying for a bigger room such as a Junior Suite, is not worth it seeing as its not much bigger or worth the money.",2,1
"This is a well known hotel.  Good location, but one which could do with a bit of a re-fresh and a re- training of staff.  When we arrived there was no hot water in our bathroom - 22 hours later, still no hot water.  The staff on the reception couldn't be any more disinterested.  The room was ok, but noisey due to constant door banging of our neighbouring rooms.  The mini- bar was outrageously priced and WiFi extortionate. 33 dollars for 3 days.  It's free in the Starbucks on the corner of the block.  If I was you I'd avoid this place til it up's it's game.",1,1
"Upon check-in, no one bothered to tell me that there's no hot water. Apparently the water heater broke that morning, and it took two days to fix it. The solution? Going around the block to an over packed gym. I paid way too much for this.",1,1
This is not trying the service was not good and the rooms are pretty nasty. Not worth the price! The shower had no door the room was always hot and the check in check out staff was not friendly at all!,1,1
"The Empire is an average hotel that charges a lot and delivers very little. For $500/night, you'll get a tiny room and be charged extra for everything from WiFi to in-room coffee. For the price, you can find better with another boutique hotel or a big chain.",2,1
"The Empire is in a great location. That is its only redeeming quality and one that the hotel staff seem to rely on to cover up a multitude of other sins. This was my second time staying at the Empire. The first time I encountered a very large cockroach in my shower (while I was showering). That was two  years ago and I was hopeful that things had improved. Not so much. The Empire has very small rooms, which is not surprising, given that it's in NYC. What is ridiculous are the bathrooms. They are microscopic, even by NYC standards. A normal size person cannot sit comfortably on the toilet. The shower has a fixed half glass wall, for what effect, I do not know, since, as a result of only a half door, water spills out all over the floor every time you take a shower. There is no",1,1
"Stayed here for 6 nights and it was ok. For the price they charge it's not worth it. Our room was so small that it almost didn't fit our bags in it. It was clean but very old and shabby.  The staff was ok but I didn't find them very helpful. Our friend wanted to send us a bottle of champagne and asked for it to be delivered at 11 pm but the staff gave us the bottle at 10 am instead. My friend wanted us to get the champagne after we got married, not before...",2,1
Poor staff.  Hotel needs major renovation.  The only reason to stay at this hotel is for proximity to Lincoln Center.  No hot water for two days. Visit the local health club for a hot shower.  Lots of attitude and no substance.,2,1
This hotel is trying hard but not succeeding in overcoming old facilities and dated rooms.  The lobby and bar area is nice however.  I would only recommend if rates are quite low. There are probably better values to be had.,2,1
Bad concierge service no heat in room we were told heat only goes on when temp goes under 50 but it was 46 out also front desk extremely unhelpful making faces when we came with our kids would never stay here again,1,1
"This hotel needs an incredible amount of help. Peeling wallpaper, malfunctioning showers, no thermostat, windows that don't completely close producing a massive amount of street noise, nicked and peeling paint, broken baseboards, lack of plugs for working, missing shower doors, non-functional bathroom design, no top sheet (only a comforter), and broken and rickety elevators. If you're going to pay this much for a room in NYC, keep looking.  This one isn't worth it.",1,1
"First of all we got to the hotel in the evening  weekend of Columbus Day and although we had ordered a room in advance through booking.com the hotel claimed that we haven't booked a room at all, after we presented the order confirmation, they simply said that the order was canceled for this night. After we talked with booking.com, it  turned out that the hotel just made overbooking so we were stuck without a room for the night. t The reception was just disgusting and unprofessional, they do not even attempted to help us.  The next day we got the room, the first impressions of this hotel are that the decor is tired, the lobby furniture worn and the whole place looks like it needs brought up to date. The elevators barely worked and  we had to wait for about 10-15 minutes, each",1,1
"Stayed here with a friend for 2 nights in order to go to the Metropolitan Opera.  The location was PERFECT.  Literally across the street from the Met.  Unfortunately, I have little else good to say about The Empire Hotel.    My friend had stayed there once before on a business trip, and came away with a favorable impression, which is why we decided to stay there.  The good: The doorman was very nice, and the front desk staff were pleasant and competent.   The bad: --the room was musty-smelling --the room was in poor condition with wall paper that was starting to peel and missing trim pieces --the climate control offered very little control over the temperature of the room, which was too warm and stuffy --our room was an interior room, i.e. no view, which I would have normally",2,1
"First impressions of this hotel are that the decor is tired, the lobby furniture worn and the whole place looks like it needs brought up to date. This was our first hotel in the USA that we had been in that needed you to pay for WIFI connection in the room and at $19 per device per day it was very expensive. You also had to pay for any coffee or tea which you made in your room $3 for a cup of coffee. There was 4 lifts to go up to the rooms but they were very unreliable and I never saw all 4 working, one day there was only 1 lift working and this caused long waits you had to add 10 minutes onto your times just in case you had a long wait for the lift. Our room was at the back of the hotel we looked onto other windows and had no view, it was also very noisy not sure if it was all",2,1
"the location was excellent...The room was smaller than expected...I drank $14 of water, because I forgot to bring with us...I have never seen such a small, inconvenient bathroom.. Tissues up so high couldn't reach...",2,1
The location is very good but so loudly! I mean you really have a hard time getting some sleep. In fact you will find ear plugs beside the bed which are obviously helpless. The thing is that two main avenues are right beside the hotel which is only 11 stories high. Further there is like a lounge discotheque at the top floor which is very loud until early in the morning. So the higher you get the louder it gets. Best floors are 7 or 6 but still noise is very annoying. The decoration is sort of tired which gives the aspect of not being clean at all. I also had some trouble with the shower which apparently did not surprise anybody at the reception. I was traveling with my kids which made everything more difficult as the room had plenty of items for sale at a very expensive price. I,1,1
"Apart from its location, this hotel was dissappointing. The lifts were very problematic thoughout my 10 days stay and it was impactful every day and a constance source of irritation.  Bascially, on a regular basis only 1or 2  of 6 lifts lift was working.  On serveral occasions I had to use the service lift waiting your turn in line...Grrrh!   The room was pleasant enough but the reception area was also a problem given one had to regularly que for long than normally expectered periods to be served. The conceige  service was below average dispensing incorrect  information regarding restaurant opening days. All in all I would avoid this hotel if you have a choice particuarly as they are going to renovate it  & they will run out the old lifts which are unreliable.  Lift rescues",2,1
"My husband and I really wanted to like this hotel. Our daughter goes to college in the immediate area and we loved the convenience however, enough is enough. With many stays behind us now, we will not return. The entire hotel and all of it's rooms are dark and dingy. The bathrooms are not well maintained and have visible dust, rust, and  damage on their doors and shower stalls. The sinks do not properly drain and the showers continually leak out onto the floor. We have stayed in several different rooms and have experienced the exact same thing in all! The heating/air conditioning units are filthy and barely work. (Again this has been true in all rooms.) The kicker this time is that we were put on the 11th floor. STAY AWAY from that on a Friday and/or Saturday night. On the 12th",1,1
"The rooftop patio shown in every website is inaccessible for families because they are pushing their nightclub, why we couldn't sit up there for the day is ridiculous.  The bathroom was small and moldy.  I get the small, but what is up with the shower, water gets every where, thus the mold.  The elevator was the slowest I have ever seen and they have another set (oh, it's just for the rooftop nightclubbers) again, couldn't you allow your guests use of it during the day?",2,1
"This used to be a great hotel. Unfortunately it has seen better times. The elevators don't work, my room had water damage on the ceiling, they are charging huge fees for internet access, and the fitness room was filthy. The room is littered with ""for sale"" food and coffee at outrageous prices. The noise from the nightclub many flights up was relentless until 3am. The door staff are lovely and helpful and the location is great—right across from Lincoln Center—but it wasn't a good experience this time.",2,1
"We were given a very small, noisy room next to the elevators.  When I asked to have the room changed they said the room was booked through a third party and this is what you get.  We will not be returning and will not be booking through third parties any longer.  They should not list their hotel as an option if in fact they do not want third party reservations.   When we checked out I said the hotel should be ashamed of themselves for even considering this a hotel room and they didn't seem to care at all.   Disgraceful!",1,1
"The rate for this hotel and the condition of the hotel are mismatched. The wallpaper in my room was peeling, there was rusty/brown spots all over the air conditioning unit, the paint was cracked and peeling around the door frames and the elevators were terribly slow. $7.50 for a bottle of $2.00 water is absurd and you should be ashamed. $3 for a cup of coffee in the room? I was shocked I did not have to pay to use a towel in my room. I have never seen a hotel nickel and dime someone the way you do. The hotel was promoted for the convention as having free wifi. The wifi was only in the lobby area and did not work. I contacted the front desk and was told free in-room wifi was not part of the package.",1,1
"You hear about this hotel from everyone, see it on every tv show and expect it to be grand and beautiful. This place needs some serious work. It is truly run down once you exit the lobby and enter your room. The shower is a european type shower with only half of a glass door. There really needs to be a full door as water gets absolutely everywhere. To the point where paint is literally falling off the walls from so much water damage. The other issues in my room included: a missing shower drain (I slipped and fell into it--gross and painful), paint issues as mentioned, all of my bathing towels had holes in them--big ones, AC that was really loud and really didn't work and no coffee maker even though I was told I had one at check in. When I called to ask for it they would not",2,1
"Dusty, Dark, Not very clean... never properly acknowledged by doormen... no communication with anyone other than minimal at check-in.  We vist NYC often and have stayed at several properties.  The Empire was not what one wold expect for a nice hotel.  Dated, Dark, nothing plus",2,1
"On the arrival we were told that we had complimentary upgrade on behalf of the hotel and were given trip advisor card to give feedback, well surprisingly the receptionist forgot to tell the most important things that I would be charged for my upgrade. I found out on the second, day after my bank rang me that my card has been blocked. The hotel was charging for my upgrade, plus they were reserving additional $600 per day for “any extras”, which was of course was never explained when I checked in and of course it affected my card after staying in the hotel for a week. I still was charged for upgrade for one night, as I only noticed it on the second day, which I found disgrace as I did not agree to it at the first place.   We were in the room 1111, which was small room with two",2,1
"Both times I've stayed here, the drains in teh sink and shower do not work.  Why can't they fix it - surely I'm not the only one with the issues.  Second, this is a happening hotel and not in a good way.  I think there was a hooker in the lobby upon my arrival, doing her hair and makeup right there in the lobby mirror.  Nothing against sex workers doing what they need to survive, but I won't support a hotel that allows that, nor do I think it makes for a safe environment.  I won't be staying there again.",1,1
"No internet. Seriously. Attending for business or pleasure for the cost of this hotel should include internet...working internet...at no cost. Additionally, the elevators failed on many instances. Oddly, I don't find that as terrible as no internet, especially when traveling for business.",2,1
Great location with very friendly staff and good reasonably priced food. The room was advertised and bought as a view over the city. We had an inside room with no view except other hotel rooms. It was noisy from the air condition unit. It was the darkest room I have ever spent time in and spoils the hotel. Also advertised an apple docking station which was also not there.,2,1
"We love you hotel and have enjoyed it many times over the years.  This trip we actually received shockingly bad service.  There was a problem with the internet to the point where we had no signal at all most days.  As we were in town on business and had planned to work from the hotel this created a big wrinkle in our plans.    We called twice a day for 3 days to speak with a manager to just see what the problem was, if it could be fixed or if we needed to move to another hotel to complete our business.  We were continuously promised return calls and told there was no known problem with the internet.  When I finally called and spoke to the internet provider they said they were well aware of the problem with the internet.    The saga gets boring after that.  We were continuously",2,1
Nice location beside central park. Beautiful lobby but our room was small and in need of an update. Crazy prices for anything in the mini bar. $7.50 for a small bottle of water! I didnt find the staff to be very polite or helpful. The pool lounge is only open at the weekend which the receptionist failed to mention despite asking her for directions to it,2,1
"Service and people where good. Location was good. The room however was not. The AC only pushed out musty air. It felt like we where staying in a moldy basement. Woke up each morning feeling, not so well.",2,1
Shocked at the run down condition of the rooms. Room was so tiny that we could barely walk around the bed with injuring our legs. Room cannot comfortably accommodate two guests. Room was quiet as requested.,1,1
"The room smells bad. Because of the courtain and the carpet, the mold smell was terrible. The hotel is good but they need to renovate the rooms and aisle and change the carpet and courtain. The bar, the reception, the service is very good.",2,1
Horrible decrepit tiny rooms with bathrooms miniscule.Bathroom drinking glasses are paper cups. Frayed duvet. Shower impossible to operate. Closet almost non-existent.  Hallway and ceiling noise..Tons of dust on nightstands.,1,1
20 minutes after checkout i called to let staff know i left my charger in the room. When i arrived back all i was told was that nothing was found. There was 0 effort to get the charger which is plugged in the outlet on the left side of the bed. For such a lack of customer service i would not recommend.,1,1
"1. When charging guests ~$400 per night, you should NOT be charging them additional fees for WIFI.  This makes the Empire come across as low-end and greedy.    2. We booked online and had multiple issues with the booking.  On the occasions I called The Empire, some staff had no record of my reservation, while others did.  It seems completely unorganized.   I was also charged a deposit in advance that was $300+ in excess of what I owed - not sure why.  3. We stayed on the 11th floor which was noisy, especially at night.  The rooftop nightclub played music extremely loud - it was clear that no courtesy or thought was extended to the guests directly below.  4. When checking out, the gentleman working at the front desk seemed baffled by the deposit I had payed and did not understand",1,1
"The great location is about the only positive point. Brusque service except from the door staff. Don't risk taking a standard room. Ours faced inwards to the area where the AC machinery was located, creating constant noise. It was like trying to sleep in a train! Our room was dingy and very hot. Wifi charged at 12$ per day , no wonder the local Starbucks and Lincoln Centre cafe were always busy. Even the in-room tea and coffee were charged for!",2,1
"The Empire is well  located but on this second stay once again found service only fair to indifferent and sometimes rude, rooms in need of paint, constant loud irritating lobby music. This will be our last stay here.",2,1
"I have stayed in many places in Manhattan (low/medium/high priced) and this was by far the most awful hotel experience I've had. Dirty rooms, an awful bathroom with peeling paint & a shower floor that made me wish I had my gym shower shoes,  totally overpriced and overrun by Fashion Week BS (parties, drunken nonsense, insane crowds). The maid service barely came (in fact, in the 4 nights/5 days I stayed my coffee/minibar service wasn't tended to at all).  You have to wait for an elevator for roughly 5-8 minutes.  There are so many other hotel options within an 8 block radius for equal prices. I will never stay at this hotel again.",2,1
AC didn't work and they wouldn't fix. Asked to be moved rooms and they wouldn't move me. 3 nights in a sweaty bed and I ended up getting very sick because of it. Staff doesn't really care or listen to what you need.,1,1
"This was my third stay at the Empire Hotel and likely my last. I booked the hotel for this trip via Priceline and was very pleased with the rate I received -- I thought I was getting a stellar deal since I (thought) I knew what to expect from this hotel. It's in a great neighborhood, and in the past I've always been please with my stay. I was registered for three nights -- Sept. 2 through Sept. 5, 2014.  Arrived on Sept. 2 and had no issues checking in. Elevators were slow, but at first this was not a big deal. The room was musty and the wall around the air conditioner was a little mildewy. Not a deal-breaker, but I wasn't thrilled. There was a small stain on the fitted sheet, and while I left the cover pulled back every morning so that the stain was evident, the sheets were not",2,1
"This hotel just has a bad energy to it. It has loud irritating music playing...the rooms are small, tired and dirty. It is located in a great location and then it goes down hill from there. The food was decent. The prices for items in the mini-bar and room were ridiculous ...$7.50 for a small bottle of water.    The staff was uncaring and down right rude. They even called the police on my husband, who had his foot elevated on a piece of furniture in a common sitting area.  The elevator situation is laughable! You have to push two different buttons.   I could go on forever...but when I found that we could check-out and go to the Waldorf Astoria for the same price...we were gone.  We stayed the 2 nights for my husband's event, that was at the hotel, but moved for the last 2 nights",1,1

"I booked this hotel at short notice to near my brother who I was visiting.  I arrived after midnight. First night was in a room which bore no resemblance to the pictures on the website. It was dark, off a grubby corridor, and the phone, television and coffee machine were all broken. My shower in the morning was cold. When I mentioned all of this in the morning I was promised a new room, which I moved to much later in the day. This one was much better and looked more like the pictures. The TV and coffee machine were fine but, when I wanted a nice hot shower after an early run in Central Park (very close) the shower didn’t work (switch between tap and shower was broken) and there was only very low power, luke warm water. I mentioned these the next morning but nothing was done",2,1
"My husband and I stayed here for 3 weeks, we live in the area and needed a place to stay while our apartment was being renovated.  The only positive thing I have to say about this hotel is that the staff are friendly and try to be as accommodating as possible.    The wifi is not reliable if you need to work, we had no heat for two days which happened to be 50 degrees on both days and raining.  Needless to say we were in our room cold for 2 nights!  If due to budget you must stay at this location please try to avoid a room on the 7th floor! The carpet is filthy in the hall and in the room.

It's a very basic hotel and if you use it as place to put your head down and shower you'll be OK it's dated and the staff in our case made no effort to be either courteous or pleasant but it is cheap and located round the corner from the subway and the lovely Manhattan diner.,2,1
"The hotel is dated and worn out! My room was located behind a back staircase that reeked with cigarette smoke. One day I came back to my room and it smelled like weed.The Cathode Ray Tube television in the room had a very limited amount of stations, which included at most 1 or 2 of the local stations. You had to run the hot water in the sink for a long time before it got hot.   There were strange looking individuals (in my opinion) checking in and hanging around the lobby. I came downstairs one time and I saw a man laying down on the lobby seats with a women sitting right next to him. I noticed a man who was always in the lobby who I assumed was security but he never said anything, literally (that includes ""hello"", ""good morning"",...).

There was no hot water, the staff 90% of the time have no idea what they’re doing & i tried to be understanding considering the circumstances. However, my sheets were filthy & when i asked for new sheets they told me I had to wait till morning. I went out bought my own sheets.  & it’s been 2 days and the sheets still haven’t been changed.

I have been patiently trying to call them and get them to refund my money, they have been dodging my calls and emails.   Their customer service department is HORRIBLE as they keep saying we cannot do anything you have to call the hotel for the refund! Are you kidding me? What is the use of a customer department ?   I am going to sue this hotel for wrongful charges and scam.",1,1

"First of all, the room smelt like weed and looks like a dive - very dirty and not maintained at all. Upon arrival, check-in was quick but after unpacking and settling in we could hear very loud scratching/squeaking coming from the radiator (we were on the 7th floor so the whole hotel MUST be infested). Went straight to reception to say that there's a rat/ mouse in the room and they changed the room immediately (even though during check in they had told us there were not any other rooms available). Without any questions asked - clearly this is a problem that they must have a lot!!! The new room stunk of cigarettes constantly. The cleaners didn't mop or change the sheets. The windows didn't open so the room was constantly stuffy and the air vent was so dusty and blew out dust when",1,1
"Wyndham you need to be ashamed.  Where are your standards?  This hotel is a dump.  The only redeeming factor is the location, 94th & Bway which is awesome for express 2/3 subway and the fact that a ton of restaurants are all within short walk.  Other than that, where do you begin?  Elevators.  I can take my office elevator to 50th floor in half the time it takes Days elevator to go 12 floors.  Half the time buttons are out. Half the time one of them is out.  Internet.  Slowest internet in NYC.  There has not been an upgrade on internet wi fi service for 10 years.  It crawls along at under 1Mbps, can you even believe this?  Half the rooms won't even connect.  Rooms. Dated. Old and horrible. Read other reviews.  Try to get hot shower in the morning and not wait 15 minutes at",1,1

The 1970s carpet had spots; the sofabed had holes and tears; had iron but no ironing board; dirty fingerprints on bathroom door; and old and worn furniture. Apparently this is half hotel/half homeless shelter. Seems like every room had a weed smoker staying there. Wyndham should be ashamed to have this place as part of their network. Was booked for 2 nights but only stayed one. Anyone who liked this place must have very low standards.",1,1
"When I stayed at this place , there was one lady who was extremely rude and disrespectful. An incident occurred over the phone and in the process of that she stated I better pray to Obama in reference to me being black . Her name was Luna . She feels she can say whatever to whom ever because she is related some way to the owners. I never had any issues there until that lady started working there . I Called Wyndham to complain but I have yet to hear back from them. The other lady Angela Nelly was extremely respectful and apologetic for what the lady Luna has said and spoke to me .

"For the last several years I've come to this particular Days Inn off of Broadway and have had quality visits. However, sadly, I can no longer say that  We decided to book in advance two short stays at the Days Inn on Broadway. First, for those interested, I will state the positives of this hotel.  The beds have always been clean and comfortable, and I've been able to take a nice hot shower with no issues. The staff understands that the hotel is very old and has issues that it can only manage. I found the majority of the staff to be helpful and courteous. The location is excellent as there are many fine restaurants in the general area, the subway station is right around the corner, and you are only a 10-minute walk from Central Park on a good day.  However, my last stay proved by",2,1
A dirty place.  No maintenance at all. Furniture was old. Door was obviously kicked in previously and never repaired.  Wallpaper was falling off and had water stains. Place smelled like smoke throughout.,1,1
"One Bad Apple can spoil a bunch! As a frequent traveler and Wyndham rewards customer, I stay at the Days Inn on 94th & Broadway. While Angela and Shayleen are attentive to any problem that may arise, the hotel needs to be invested in. The interior is outdated and in some parts of the hotel down right disgusting. At night the women at reception has been UNHELPFUL , RUDE, and RACIST. I was given 35% off of my next stay at the hotel by a manager and had booked a 2 night stay in which I wanted to apply the discount. Because of her lack of knowledge or maybe the fact that she couldn’t be bother I was not able to apply the discount.

Our room was put down as a no-show three days after we checked in and we were locked out of our room and it was booked for someone else. We had to try and deal with getting back into our room at 1 in the morning and were being told it was our fault because we didn't know who checked us in, didn't answer the phone when they called the room once that afternoon (because we were out on vacation enjoying New York), and that we needed to handle it. After sorting through this mess we were called the next day and were being asked why we never showed up and who were the people the hotel booked in our",1,1
"Although I had very low expectations, this low-end property was not as bad as it could have been. A bit shabby (with the same carpet I had in my apartment in 1978) and rundown but clean. But, there was no internet because my room was too far away from an access point. Not normally a huge issue but the desk clerk lied about what had been/was being/would be done about it...which was nothing.

"Horrible place. It's false advertising, pictures on website do not reflect the realiy of it. It's filthy, dingy, falling apart, and there were cocroaches in the bathroom.

I have never felt so cheated on a hotel stay, definitely stay away.",1,1
"Booking a place without checking reviews was my biggest error. The photos look nothing like the website and Basil Fawlty & staff have much in common. The fire alarm going off at 2am was accompanied by an announcement we think in Spanish but we will never know as an announcement in English never followed. Having spent 2 hours in the street we reentered the hotel & suggested to desk staff that an announcement in English would be appropriate to which he replied ‘I’ve had a very busy night & didn’t have time’ 😳.

I went down and requested a room located INSIDE the building - and was immediately accommodated. I was given the choice of two other rooms. The hotel is VERY old, and décor is extremely outdated - however, the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and we didn't spend too much time at the hotel to find anything to complain about (Why would you spend your time in NYC in the hotel room anyways?!) We were happy to have",2,1
Booked a business room (Premier Club) with two separate beds but got a room in the unrenovated part of the hotel where wifi didn't work. They tried to give us three different rooms the first night and no one had two beds. We slept in a room with no heat turned on and with only one bed. They promised us the room we booked but the next day we got a standard room. We never got the type of room we paid for for the enture 5 nights stay. There were old beds and furnitures++++ and staff wasn't very friendly or serviceminded.,1,1
"Luckily we only spent one night here. The staff were rude and I was a witness while waiting in line to check in listening to people’s complaints. One man said to the staff, “don’t smile at me while I tell you how unhappy I am with my room.” Once you go to your room, the hallways are actually scary. I felt like I was in a horror movie. My room had ripped carpet on the sides and the bed skirts were torn.  The positives; location is decent. Lobby is decent. You get a 10 percent coupon from lobby if you eat at the diner located very close to hotel.  You get what you pay for. Lesson learned from me. Never again.",1,1
"Dear Friends, Please avoid as much as you can. The worst place to stay unless the price with tax is less than $70. It's more like a Motel rather than a hotel.

I saw this first hand when I was waiting to check-in and the phone was ringing and no one at the front desk. I arrived late, tired after my travel but no one was there at the front desk. No bell to call them either, so I had to wait around standing for a long time. The front desk person was very unfriendly. The room key didn't work the first time and I had to come back down.

"We spent 6 nights at Days Inn last week. Our travel agent had booked it for us and we had paid Aus $1994 in advance so were “locked in”. We had no idea what to expect from hotels in New York. We were shown a corner room on 9th floor with duct tape around the two windows. Very shabby and noisy. When we complained we got another room on 8th floor in a similar state however there was only one window so it was a bit quieter. The floorboards dipped outside the bathroom door, no plug in sink, just a hole, toilet seat peeling, carpet sticky, furniture badly scuffed, window filthy.  On the very small positive side, bedding was clean and room was serviced each day. Staff on desk were helpful.

The rooms are tired, yellow, peeling, and you feel as if the entire building should be condemned. None of the guests make eye contact with each other because you are all ashamed to be there.

Turns out, the so called ""voucher"" is only for a discounted rate at the parking garage two blocks over.  This is blatant false advertising. The front desk staff was apologetic.

"Our room was quite run-down and the air conditioning was so loud we couldn't talk over it, let alone sleep. However, once we notified the front desk they did fix it. The hotel wasn't cheap by my standards but I guess in NY this was a low-end stay. The bathroom was so tiny and cramped. On top of that, the shuttle service they offer to get me to the airport caused me to miss my flight. They recommended an hour and a half travel time so I doubled that and reserved a shuttle that left three hours before my flight and the shuttle driver was a disaster. I spent the next 24 hours in airports trying to get home!",2,1

We were 4 people and they tried to charge us US 10,00 to keep the fourth luggage while we waited for check-in I don’t recommend this place for anybody.",1,1
"The bed was clean, the A/C worked, there was hot water, the parking lot was only two blocks away, and Central Park is only three blocks away.  But...the mattress was heavily covered to conceal the springs pushing out the sides, the CRT television did not carry ABC or CBS, there are no easy-to-reach outlets to recharge electronics, the carpeting covered several depressions in the floor, and the bathroom light switch was taped together!  This is an old building, and a relatively for New York cheaper in cost hotel.  There are few options in the area, and it's a shame the place wasn't fully renovated.  Next time in NYC I will stay in an area where there are more options.  One tip:  If you happen to stay there and need to go further uptown, walk to 96th Street before catching and",2,1
"The front desk staff was rude. The room was very old, with saggy uncomfortable beds, very old worn out furniture and filthy carpeting.   I would not have stayed, but the room was prepaid so I had no option but to remain.   Do not stay here, you will be very sorry.",1,1
"Let’s start with the good: beds are really comfy and location is great! Really close to a 1, 2 and 3 train which all go to Times Square! Bad: front desk is kind of rude, building is outdated and dirty, our AC fan was a dust mess when we got here, there are weird spots all over our mirror, like paint stained, you can hear everything in the hallway, bathroom fan is loud and dirty, we had to have maintenance up twice to fix our tv that wouldn’t turn on. And last but not least... don’t expect to have wifi!!! It does not work. Ever. It’s a password-less free wifi so I’m sure the locals are soaking that up. We stayed on the 9th floor and I only had it work in the early morning or late, late at night. I’d avoid next time. For sure.",2,1
"I would give this 0 stars if I could. We walked into the room and there was a leak coming from the ceiling, dripping onto the floor - as a result, the rug was wet. There was no hot water in the bathroom and the room smelled like smoke. We asked to move rooms given the wet floor but the font desk told us that they didn't have any other rooms available. We left and booked a new hotel. We've been trying to recoup our money ever since. I've called the location 12 times in the past week and each time they hang up the phone upon answering it. Don't stay here.",1,1
"I got a room at the 9th floor that looked like a cheap hotel down in the harbour, but the internet worked, bathroom was outdated, the toilet seat was in a dubious shape.I asked for an upgrade and they gave me a room at the 13th floor,they say is the penthouse but is way overrated.The suit was ok but the bathroom was outdated,a lot of rust ,the shower head leaked.There was a very dirty sofa in the living room ,but the main thing that annoyed me was that the internet didn't work.I asked for several times at the front desk to do something about it and they kindly told me that there is nothing to do because the router is too far from the room.And one last thing,I asked at the reception to change the coffee maker, they said yes, yes, but nothing, not a word more, they didn't change",2,1
"Location- Brilliant so close to the subway and easy to get to central park! Approx nearly 2 hours from J F KENNEDY airport because traffic is manic so make sure you have a decent flight time!   Hotel its self is very dated. It needs rennovating badly! The hallways smelt like cigarette/damp smell, which wasn't nice. The evelvator sometimes didn't work as well as you wanted it to the buttons didn't highlight to go to the correct floor. The vending machines didn't want to vend out the water serval occasions. (buy your water from the chemist next door). The staff at this hotel were very kind and really helpful even the cleaners spoke good english and understood me well.   The room itself was baking hot no instructions on how to turn the temperature down. No windows to open either- I",2,1
"Visited NYC with 2 kids for spring break and wanted a room with a living area. I initially booked a one bedroom, the next day I called and was “upgraded” to a business suit.  Oh boy, that unit looked like someone had just lost all their belongings. Then picked up a few furniture from the dumpster. The head board fell off when I was trying to lay down. It took them about one hour for someone to come look at it.  At that point, I requested another room, and that took another while. All this time, none of the staff apologized for the inconvenience, they felt bothered. There was one guy who cared a little bit but I was too frustrated to get his name!  Don’t get me started on the view, the view from both room are of huge dumpsters. Don’t be deceived by the fake pictures of a",1,1
Website pics are falsely advertising. Rooms are moldy amd extremely dated. Rust in the bathtubs and the cabinet doors hanging off. And the hotel complimentary cups even though bagged contained residue of a bug. Just dont,1,1
"The ONLY thing that was good about this hotel was the location - close proximity to the train, and reasonably-priced (for NYC, anyway) parking a block away where we could leave our car ($80 for 48 hours). That was it.  The room was REALLY dingy - cracks in the wall and ceiling, peeling walls, the works), the carpet was dirty, and there was literally a large SQUISHY spot on the floor that I could feel under the carpet outside the bathroom - I thought I was going to fall through to the floor below us.  And NOTHING WORKED in the room. The TV wouldn't even turn on - AT ALL - and there was no remote to be found for it anyway. Even trying to turn it on from the button on the TV itself didn't work. It was dead.  There were ZERO blankets (just two thin sheets on the bed, which",1,1
"Rooms shown were so bad we decided not to stay, receptionist agreed and gave us paperwork to 'prove' we didn't stay so we wouldn't be charged. Guess what... they charged us anyway!!!! $523. Furthermore they are lying to the investigation into their conduct saying we stayed. Cannot believe Days Inn want their brand to be tarnished in this way. DO NOT STAY HERE",1,1
"We handled the outdated rooms but the loud “chanting”, cussing, and banging on the doors was horrible.  Not sure what type of company this place keeps!  Our kids were scared by the 2:30 am wake up calls outside of the room.  We also were told that our room was fancy compared to some of the other rooms.  Which was surprising since the left side of the bed seemed to have a large rip or gash in it!",1,1
"Room was very aged, carpet felt dirty and had a big iron burn in it, everything was old, aged, worn and a bit dusty, TV from the 80s, sink had no stopper yet wouldn't drain.  It took three trips up and down in the elevator to even get into my room as the keys wouldn't work. My room was located in the fire escape stair well, where everything stank of bleach. Presumably after a good hosing down from the previous tenant.  However the absolute worst feature was despite being many floors up, the noise from the dive across the road was incredible until about 3am.  If you're young, in NYC to go out late, get drunk and not really worry about the standard of your accomodation or sleep, and need a place at the more budget end or at the last minute, then you might consider this place.",1,1
"Lobby was dirty as was the elevator, Oh well, anyone can have a bad day. Not. The room was very well worn. Side tables were peeling paint as was the desk, no blackout curtains just Venetian blinds, one of whose slats was held together with a band-aid! The bottom of the bathroom door was rotting, the curtain rod was sagging and the bath towel was full of holes. The desk sent up a new slat for the blinds and we got a new towel. The manager said she couldn’t do anything for us as we had booked ‘thru an agency, but she said she would get back to us. I waited and waited and thus this belated review.Days Inn/Wyndham should be ashamed to have their name on this property and should pull the franchise. The staff at the desk were great, but they don’t have anything to work with.",2,1
Ive frequent this hotel over the years my last stay showed how runned down it is and can stand a makeover. I nearly froze in my room as they control the heat..and only had thin sheets as a means of a comforter.,2,1
From moment we walked into lobby I knew it was disgusting  Lobby filthy carpets sticky dust everywhere and not to mention the stench of weed all over the hotel  Our room was disgusting with some kind of spillage in the radiator  Room was freezing and only sheets on bed no duvet  Do not stay here,1,1
"This hotel was a train wreck from the minute I walked in. The lobby, elevators, hallways, and room were filthy, with broken furniture, peeling wallpaper, and broken blinds. The heat didn't work. When I asked for an additional blanket, the one delivered to my door, after two calls, had stains on it. The front desk staff were helpful in helping me find an alternative hotel; they had clearly dealt with this kind of issue before. When I tried to get  a refund through their corporate service line, I had one of the worst customer service interactions I had had in many years, and it was with a supervisor!",1,1
"We checked into this property on 12/26 for an after Christmas Vacation with our son. On arrival at the Property there was problems after problem.. The TV in the room didn't work, The Windows were so dirty you could not see the City the blinds were broken and OLD. The desk service could only be worst if i had gone to the front desk at the neighboring hotel. The Bathroom was outdated and the fixtures did not work. They charged an extra 900plus Dollars on my Credit Card and Expected me to get it corrected. There housekeeping was second to NONE. Could not even leave you clean towels. Asked the Desk to call an Taxi and was told to go to the corner and hail my own Taxi at 5AM.  THIS PROPERTY SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   ITS in need of being Condemned!!!!!!!",1,1
"Days Inn is next door to Hotel Newton - the differences are great.  If not full, the Newton is first, second, third choice.  One thin blanket and temperature FIXED at something less than 70 degrees meant sleeping in my clothes.    The hotel reminds me of a rent-control apartment where everything is worn and decrepit and the landlord is encouraging you to leave.  Here they want you to come again.  Not if the Newton has vacancies.    The staff is friendly and discreet.  The room was clean.",2,1
"Uh, so, if I had been actually planning on spending any time in this room, I would have been extremely disappointed and likely requested a refund. It was just me, and I mean...the shower worked, the door locked, and the bed was alright, but my room was extremely run-down and a little bit scary, to be honest. If a couple booked into this hotel and expected a romantic getaway or something, they'd likely just be trying to getaway from this room entirely! Yikes.  The staff were nice and polite, though. It's not their fault! This place just needs a massive overhaul. But location-wise, it can't be beat, so why would they fix it up, y'know?",2,1
"We were with two kids. It is very convenient location, but the rooms are terrible. The first room the toilet wasnt working and whatever you make, it was there for ages. They change our room, because we request it, but the other one we have in front of us someone consuming drugs and also old and not very clean.",1,1
"Hmmmm, Should I begin with how disappointing it was to book this hotel through TripAdvisor and have it be such a totally horrible experience? (Still waiting on that refund!!!) Or maybe I should just describe the room. Dirty, stained carpet. Lampshades that were broken, stained. Heat/Air unit that sounded like it had rats running around inside, or maybe hamsters on a wheel but really this place inspired thoughts of rats. Or maybe I should talk about the smoke alarm going off and smoke pouring into my room under the door. Hallway filled with smoke which was nothing but some really stupid person smoking a heck of a lot of weed. Oh and 1983 called and wants it's TV back.",1,1
"The hotel is obviously a bit battered when you arrive but the state of some of the rooms is awful. In my first room: innumerable stains on the carpets and walls, windows and air-con damaged and held together with duct tape, indescribable stains on the tv cabinet, the door to the bathroom had been punched through and then very poorly patched. Hairs in the bath. After I complained they moved me to a 'better' room - that by the standards of any other hotel would have been miserable - cigarette burns in all the furniture, torn shade on the lamp but I was just grateful it was marginally less of a fleapit. Hope to  never return.",1,1
"Pictures will tell the truth..unfortunately we got here only because we got scammed by manhattanregencyapartments.com (we had booked an apartment nearby this place, paid $1000 before arriving and found nothing...) so we had to find a place where to stay closeby (after 10h flying it's an horrible surprise..).  We got here, asked for a room and a rude guy at front desk said $208 for one night. No breakfast. Well, as it was late at night after this nightmare I had to take the room.  Trust me when I say A DUMP IS FAR BETTER THAN THIS 1* HOTEL. DUST EVERYWHERE, FURNITURES OF MID 20'S, TV DIDN'T WORK, WIFI NEVER WORKED AMYWHERE, FREEZING COLD IN THE ROOM AND A HEATER THAT WAS RESTING ON THE WALL AND DID NEVER WORK. AWFUL EXPERIENCE. DON'T YOU EVER GET SCAMMED EVEN FROM THESE HORRIBLE",1,1
"Utterly miserable place - NO HEAT!, dirty, ripped, stained wallpaper, chipped paint, stained and ripped lampshades, no TV listing or access to guide and, did I mention -NO HEAT  in the room in the winter in NYC!! Front desk ignores calls for help. After 2.5 hours of complaining, they explained that there is no heat control in the room, it is master controlled in the basement and they brought me an extra blanket -  their version of heat. See photos below.",1,1
"After we had a problem with our Airbnb we had to quickly find another place to stay. Not surprisingly, Days Inn had a vacancy. We were grateful for clean bedding and towels, but bare minimum is the best description for this hotel. It was outdated and run down but it was available for us and right around the corner from the subway express stop.",2,1
"I stayed here from December 6th_9th. Hotel website advertise a renovated rooms. City was booked and prices super high, so I booked this place for $242.00 a night. My first night I had to switch rooms, not happy with my penthouse room but was better than firts room. Carpets are dirty with bad odor. All furnitures over used with trashy look. Hot water takes over 20 minutes to come out the pipes. Elevators disgusting. Front desk customer service lazy, Unprofessional, rude. The management of that hotel is a disaster. Never again!! I saw at least 7 guests complaining at the front desk while I waited for an email to get print out. The worst part is that no one cares.",1,1
"This hotel has a great location, close to the subway, good restaurants and interesting shops, but the property isn't kept up. Dirty elevator, burn holes in lamp shades, were just a few of our observations. The deal seal was when the headboard fell off the wall, and after we called the front desk, a maintenance worker showed up at the door with a plunger. (Yes, a plunger, no kidding).",1,1
"So the positives: Location - right next to subway and in Upper West Side. The room itself was clean, and relatively quiet for NYC. Wifi worked pretty well. The room was decently sized.  The negatives, and there's a lot of them: - The hotel is old, tired, and run down. There was a hole in our bathroom door, and burn marks in the lamp. - The TV barely worked - the screen was all fuzzy. And of course no HDMI, so I couldn't even use my own chromecast. - A smoke alarm battery was chirping all night in the hallway, and nobody from hotel management or housekeeping cared enough to replace the battery. - No towels in room at check-in. - Fitness center was a misnomer - it is 1 treadmill and 1 bike. That's it. - The unit next to us reeked of smoking and marijuana. - No security - The room",2,1
"I booked this hotel for two night I was in NYC. The first morning after a cold shower the front dest assured me they would have someone look at it. I guess that's all they did because the next morning i woke to a cold shower again. In general hotel was run down but clean. Also NO COFFEE in room or lobby. On the plus, Location is perfect, 24 hour food ect around the block. Parking can be tricky too.",1,1
"I should have read the reviews.  Don't make my mistake. My sick husband and I stayed here for 2 nights this week.  No heat.  Let me repeat that, so it is plain to understand.  It is New York City, middle of November and we had NO HEAT.  All the bad stuff in the reviews is absolutely true.  It is dingy and dirty, although to their credit, our bathroom was clean and the shower had nice hot water. The prices on the website are slightly misleading, unless you are very careful to look at nightly prices, which appear to change with the tidal cycle.  But I digress.  The lock on the door was iffy.  You had to fumble around with the key cards and eventually, figure out how slowly to pull the card out so that you could get into the room.  I had to get news keys made twice, after the",1,1
"I chose this hotel for my stay for which I paid USD 1166 for 6 nights. It is just not value for money. The hotel is definitely strategically placed and about 15 minutes away from Times Square by cab and just about 3 stations away by train but it does not look the same as shown in pictures. Once you cross the reception area, the whole hotel appears to be a dungeon. The lifts are very small and old style. The floors are crammed and the room is definitely not value for money. One might as well look for deals and stay in a Hilton or likewise in the same amount or perhaps just a few dollars more. Watch out guys before you book in.",1,1
"This was supposed to be a very inexpensive hotel.  And I know that an inexpensive hotel in NYC isn't the same as an inexpensive hotel in, say, Backwoods, Indiana.  I found a pre-paid rate that I couldn't pass up, and so I prepaid what I felt, at the time, would be a cheap stay. And while I was there, I adjusted my expectations accordingly. For example, a cheap hotel in Indiana would have a place to set up a computer (with a plug) curtains on the windows, a toilet that doesn't have to have the handle jiggled, etc. So I wasn't surprised that such things were missing at this hotel. And I am fully aware of the stereotypical NYC attitude.   But... Daaaang. I wasn't expecting that I'd be charged twice...at a higher rate...and that the Manager either never came in, or told people to",1,1
"This hotel is a very tired and rundown hotel- the decor is sad and dull, the tv is so old and has bad static, and the towels are old and scratchy. The coffee machine was filthy, I tried to make hot water and it came out brown. I found our toilet leaking water on the floor, and it screeched whenever it was flushed. I called the reception at 9am to report the leaking toilet, no maintenance came all day... after seeing reception face-to-face at 730pm a maintenance man came up at 8pm and repaired the toilet.  The front desk staff are slow and unwelcoming. They kindly locked me out of my room a day early due to their own miscommunication and made me wait 20mins at the front desk before telling me I had to make another reservation because my room was no longer available but my",1,1
Don't waste your money staying here. Dirty old rooms which look nothing like what's advertised. Most staff don't or won't speak English. More like a doss house. False advertising. We booked this place as the pictures showed decent looking accomodation. In reality it's completly the opposite. Misrepresentation personified.,1,1
"My goodness what can I say other than crooks! When you are charging that much per night I don't care what star you are but there has to be some liveable standard. Our room was dark, wall paper torn all around, floor stained, tub so rusted my son kept saying ""someone pooped there"" and the worst at night we started hearing movement in the room russling through the bags. All I can say is my wife and I clutched to our sinking double beds. At first sunrise took my children and ran.",1,1
This hotel is overrated. Needs updating big time. Lift very dirty. Staff rude. Nothing good to say about this hotel. Very noisy from road traffic all the time. The only good thing was very near to subway station,1,1
"I stayed at the Days Inn Hotel New York City-Broadway back in August and was appalled by the state of my room. During my stay the room was in the stairwell with no security and I dealt with a leaky bathtub, mold in both the bathroom and the main room, and the bathroom window was stuck open. IT also smelled of wet towels and/or urine. I paid for a queen bed but received a double bed. I felt so unsafe in the hotel that my son who was moving into his new apartment came and stayed with me in the double bed. I do not recommend anyone stay in this hotel.",1,1
"I am still trying to get my money back after hotel charged me twice for the room.  They gave me $181.00 back out to the charge of $510.00 and I am having a terrible time getting the rest of my money back.  If you use this hotel and you see that they have charged you on check in after you have already paid, DO NOT LEAVE THIS HOTEL UNTIL YOU HAVE YOUR CHARGES REMOVED otherwise it is very difficult if not impossible to get your money back.",2,1
"The room looked nothing like the one shown on their website.  No bedspread, no curtains, multiple stains on the carpet right when you walk in the room, banged up lamp shade, stains on the wall.  If we hadn’t arrived so late at night we would have asked for a different room but I later realized that the level of deception here was so great that I doubt they had any decent rooms to offer.  We were in town for only 36 hours so we chalked it up to experience - next time I’ll read reviews before booking!  I feel sorry for the staff because they must get a lot of grief from unsatisfied customers and they are powerless to change it.",1,1
"Everything in the room is old. This hotel needs an urgent renovation. Actually it needs a total make over. The bathroom was disgusting and to get some hot water you need to wait 10 minutes! The windows in the room aren't sealed so the so if you don't turn the heat on during the night you wake up freezing. On top of it all, it isn't cheap at all. The only good I can find is the staff are very nice.",2,1
We arrived having booked for 3 adults as our teenager counted as an adult. We had to ask for bedding for the sofa bed as none had been supplied. When the member of staff arrived he only had sheets as there were no blankets available. We had to ask for additional towels as only 2 were supplied. The fridge leaked and having reported it it was not fixed for 2 days. The rooms were very tired and had cigarette burns on the furniture. There was nothing on the website to suggest smoking was allowed in the room but our room was smelling of smoke. The hotel overall was very tired and i am in the process of making a complaint to Days Inn. I would not stay again nor would i ever recommend it.,2,1
"After a decade of yearly visits because of its great location, this hotel is in total decline.  Apart from filth almost everywhere, there is a mammoth 20 story bldg going up directly adjacent.  Construction noises will continue for at least 2 years.  Management is ABSENT. Room cards work half the time, elevator service unpredictable to lousy, ancient A/c units, not enough outlets, TV erratic, window blinds don’t work (workers in the construction site have good peeking views), not enough towels, no towel rack, tissue wall box rusty, no hand held such a great shower attachment ( but YES, good hot water and pressure, and toilet flushes well - a welcome surprise), and an idiosyncratic price structure.  Examine your bill CAREFULLY, as they made ‘mistakes’ on my last 2 visits and it",1,1
"This entire hotel was dirty.  The lobby, the elevators, the hallway, the ""fitness"" room, etc.  It was a horrible experience and I wouldn't wish this on my worst friend.  Two words for you:  RUN AWAY. I can forgive some things but combine the hotel WITH the staff made it even worse.",1,1
"One or both of our daughters have lived in Manhattan since 2005.  We have stayed in various hotels there dozens of times. On this occasion our flight to New York was late and we did not arrive until well after midnight. It was Fashion Week and difficult to find a hotel, it was a late-planned trip after we found out our 4 year old granddaughter was asked to be in a runway show.  We had reservations at the Days Inn at 94th and Broadway at roughly $300 per night for 5 nights.  The noticeably indifferent hotel clerk assigned us to Room 214.  We were stunned at how bad the room was.  Carpet - Stained and worn.  Furniture - so beat up an dirty it would have been embarrassing to give away. Wallpaper - stained and peeling off walls. Shower tub - stained and dirty.  Lights - most had no",1,1
"Spent 4 nights as part of a family trip. Had low expectations hence no disappointment. Pros: location near 96 station makes it accessible throughout the city, relatively low price. Cons: some service issues (beds were not made one night), lack of towels, clogged toilet",2,1
"Moderately shabby lobby and rooms.  Lackadaisical service.  Many things not working properly: light bulbs, plumbing, windows, elevators.  Bad at replacing towels, toilet paper, tissues. amenities The staff was prompt in responding , but seemed to operate on idea that they will attend to flaws whenever a guests complain. We booked for a week, left after 2 nights and never looked back.",2,1
Coffee machine was dirty. Reception not responsive. I went twice to reception to request then they didn’t want to replace but had to do when I was adamant. The only positive is the location. Very close to city centre and subway station is just a few steps away.,1,1
it needs better services and a microwave to heat up the food and is very expensive and i didn’t appreciate how the front desk was calling for check out and sending someone knocking on the door every 5 mins,1,1
"I called the number on the website and booked a room for that night. The agent on the phone asked when I would be checking in and I told her in about 20 minutes. When I got to the hotel the person working the front desk, Anthony, informed me that the reservation was for the following night. This was false. I stood in front of him and called customer service, who confirmed the reservation was for that night, and not the next day. He was unapologetic and slightly rude, as he refused to give me a room, claiming they were fully booked. The agent on the phone was helpful in finding another hotel.",1,1
"We booked this hotel for 3 nights for our family holiday.  Positives-close to Central Park, Manhattan Diner, Laundromat and coffee shops.  Negatives - very far from Manhattan and other major attractions.  I said not for faint hearted because I am not claustrophobic but the hallways made me feel nauseous. They are like narrow alleyways where I found it challenging to find our room for two days.  The rooms were super small and the beds were very small as well. Shockingly, one of them was just one foot away from toilet door.  We booked the room for 4 guests but we never had 4 towels and housekeeping and front desk did not answer the intercom.  I had to call the reservation number from my mobile who transferred me to front desk and we got our towel. Next day it was the same story",2,1
"Advertised as recently updated this place was a disaster. If I could have moved I would have. Disrepair does not describe it. Torn and stained window shades, dead cockroaches, furniture found in a dumpster, smelly, tub rusty and chipped, vanity door hanging off and the list goes on. I asked to be moved  and it was a bit better....but just a bit. Thank goodness it was one night only. Requested towels, blankets, coffee and cups from management. No surprise, never received.  WiFidid not work. Called about that and I was to,d to turn my WiFi on and off, my iPad on and off. Of course I had done that. A technician was sent up. He came to repair the hairdryer.

Vending machine (not on 8th floor) was broken.  Ice was three floors away.  WiFi was so slow as to be unusable.  What can only be described as ""Surge"" pricing was in effect for us. Seen rooms down to $84 today vs the more than $200 theycharhed us.",1,1
"The room was dirty, very small, outdated TV, very Foul smell on the hallways. The customer service gave us 2 rooms that were supposed to be connected when we had the reservation. When we got there they don't even have rooms connected or close to each other, we had our girls with us and that made the stay a little bit tough. The location is great but that's it nothing else.",1,1
"Do not stay here! I paid $500 for 3 nights, and it was ridiculous. Even if you are on a budget, I’m sure you can find a much better hotel elsewhere.   My room was not ready when I arrived at the hotel, because the cleaning staff was taking their sweet time. When the front desk tried calling them, they would not respond. They kept telling me that it would be ready soon, but I ended up waiting for an hour before I got my room. The front desk staff as also very rude and gave me attitude when I asked why my room wasn’t ready.   The hallways and elevators are not ventilated, and have a smoky, pungent smell. The rooms are not that much better. The walls are paper thin, so you can very easily hear everyone’s detailed conversations. I had to call the front desk a few times on my first",1,1
"Great location on upper west side. But it was dingy, dark, noisey and not the cleanest place I have ever stayed, I attribute the cleanliness to the age of the venue and not to the efforts of cleaning staff.",2,1
Old tiny room. Smelly. 1 night was too long. We were put in a room that was on the stair well. Staff ok but not great. They did mind our luggage for us   Good. Furniture broken. ............... Wouldn’t go back even though good location.,1,1
This is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. Room felt unclean. We never had enough towels. Exposed carpet tack strip. Duct tape on hall carpet. Chipped furniture. Drawers wouldn’t close. TV was old with limited channels. Musty unsecured  exercise room.,1,1
"Well, our airline overbooked our JFK flight and flew us to New Jersey. We caught a cab and made it to the hotel an hour and a half later than we wanted to be.   We booked this hotel based upon the close proximity to JFK, shuttle service and breakfast.  We arrived at midnight. Our room was on the top floor overlooking the entry. There was already a party going on somewhere. Lots of screaming, yelling and music. We didn’t sleep until 2:30ish and we had an early flight the next morning.  The room was small. The foldout bed was placed right in front of the bathroom, I don’t know why it couldn’t be next to the window instead. So, you had to crawl over the person using the pullout bed.  Breakfast was subpar.  I complained to the desk in the morning. All he said was sorry.  Shuttle",1,1
"I am still at this hotel right now, but after two nights I have to share my experience.  This hotel is in a good location, which is why I decided to stay here with my teenage daughter, the rest is bad.  I just fell in the shower because the anti-skid stickers are worn totally smooth, then when I step out of the shower there is no bath mat and I have to step onto slippery wet tile.  Our toilet has clogged, twice!  There are four elevators and at any given time it seems that only 1 or 2 are operational.  The air conditioning unit vibrates so we have chairs wedged against it to try and stop the vibration.  Yesterday when we got back to the hotel neither of our keys would work so we had to find a working elevator, return to the lobby, and talk to the bored people at the desk to fix",1,1
"The only good thing about this hotel was the location, but I would not stay here again. The front desk staff are clueless, at best. It took a long time checking in. Elevators at straight out of the 80’s- tiny, mirrors and lights. The hallways leading to the rooms are dark, confusing, and like a maze. And boy are you in for a treat when you see the rooms!!  So horrible that it’s hysterical! The beds light up- Austin Powers style...no lie. The carpets are gross, bathroom floor sticky, old fashioned clip lights on the beds, old lumpy mattresses, bedroom tables covered with contact paper- and had lumps all over them because even that wasn’t applied correctly. Requested a fridge for the room- wasn’t there. Called down twice to remind them, because apparently waiting 2 hours didn’t",1,1
"I think they must be going to sell or convert this place. It’s TOTALLY neglected worn out carpet,missing grout, patched but unpainted wall areas in the rooms and hallway TINY coffee pot 1) First they gave us a key to a occupied room with luggage and a used bed 2) Reserved a queen deluxe with convertible couch in a separate sitting room. There was none in room we were told ALL the couches in the motel were broken.  They gave us a miserable folding bed and nothing to sit on in the sitting room 3) The shower handle fell off and water ran out the handle, the drain plug in the tub was broken, the sink cabinet door was broken and hanging Some Elevator buttons don’t work, they told me now to use the snack Mechines they were broken to go down the street. They warned me that only one ice",1,1
"Upon arriving about 6pm, we were greeted by not very friendly reception staff and the concierge was asleep standing up at his desk and just pushed a map across to us ....  the room - well well.... it’s old, stuffy, dirty and dated.  The beds are comfortable and looked clean enough but the A/C which did work but was noisy all night long. There are no dark blinds and as for a view the windows are so dirty you can’t see out of them at all.  The bathroom - well the ceiling is mouldy and the bath has a cracked tile around the main spout. There is mould all around the tub and it’s stained and old. Our shower blocked on the first night which made me almost sick showering in a 3 inch bath of god knows what coming up from the drain. When we asked for someone to come and unblock it I was",1,1
This place is disgusting! They show pictures on their website of updated rooms when what they’re actually selling is out dated garbage rooms. Their front desk staff is not friendly/useful and not willing to help with issues caused by the hotel. They should not be allowed to serve ham and cheese sandwiches to the homeless.   I stayed two nights. The first night I informed them about the air conditioner not working  and they sent someone to the room who did nothing about it. The second night after coming back to the room the AC was completely broken. They did the bare minimum of sending me to another below average room. Do yourself a favor spend your money at a place that doesn’t look like they rent rooms by the hour.,1,1
"On the positive side... Hotel was conviently located near the metro, central park, a few food places. The area was pretty safe and the bed and linens were clean. Most of the front desk staff were nice.  On the negative side... Hotel is run down and old. Most carpets are worn out and stained. Almost everthing in the rooms are dated and show some sort of wear (ripped, rust, dust, dirt, etc...). Price is high, but it is New York.  Overall, if you go in expecting a regular Days Inn prepare to be extremely disappointed. If you go in expecting hostel or a $30/night hotel somewhere else, you will be pleasantly surprised.",2,1
"Horrible hotel very unorganized with a guy running around with like a chicken with his head cut off.  No cold water in entire hotel in heatwave, 50 people stuck waiting for an elevator the room was disgusting didn’t want to remove any clothing constantly looking for bugs.  People smoking up on floor terrible customer service.  Don’t ask for help with a ride they have a guy who comes in a limo and rips you off...gives finders fee to them!  Don’t stay here,",1,1
"I booked this hotel for the last week in June starting on June 23rd. I canceled the hotel on June 17th. I received a confirmation email stating I would not be charged and the cancellation was free. However upon review of my credit card, it showed that they still charged for the full week $1600! I called their reservation department and it shows I cancelled and should not have been charged. I was transferred to the front desk, and their it says they marked me as a no show! Neither people could refund the charge. My husband spent 2 hours on the phone yesterday and they still won’t refund us the money. They said the issue is the reservation was done through a 3rd party - booking.com, so they can’t fix it. I’ve stayed at many hotels using 3rd party reservations, and have never had",1,1
"Pros: awesome location, quiet, and very clean- the housekeepers do an excellent job  Cons: Extremely shabby rooms with old, uncomfortable full size beds with cheap bedding and 90s TVs. Showers are terrible and there is no space in the bathroom to get ready. Rooms are small with old stained carpets and extremely dated furniture. The hotel posts photos of a few renovated rooms to trick you into booking and does not offer refunds when you discover the true state of the rooms. Wifi does not work in the rooms in the stairwell- they end with 09.",2,1
"The hotel room was an okay size, location was good, staff generally friendly and helpful and the water pressure was good, otherwise the room wasn’t great.  The room had thick cobwebs in the corners, hairs in the bath, rust around the plug hole, peeling wallpaper, holes in the bed linen and our bed was so lumpy with a mattress that was trashed on one side. The water temperature in the shower fluctuated from icy to scalding throughout the duration of a shower without any adjustment on my part and there was no bath mat and the shower was permanently angled so that the floor was dangerously soaked and slippy. We asked for extra towels just so we could put one down after the first evening! The windows were so thin that you could hear the noise of the city at all hours and we all woke",2,1
"My son and I stayed for two nights. Room 824, the beds and bathroom were clean and that’s it. The carpets were sticky, dust and fluff under the beds, noisy air con which had the red light on indicating the filter was blocked, The basin in the bathroom was cracked and the whole place is very, very tired. The entrance is really on 94th street not Broadway which, as advertised, is a bit deceiving and it’s a long, long walk from all the sights.",1,1
"We made a last minute online booking for 1 night as our accommodation had fallen through after 29hrs in transit & needed somewhere to rest & make a plan. We paid USD$240. I would barely even give it 1 star.. worst hotel I have ever stayed in! Not worth $240. The only positive, was the bathroom was clean. The bed was awful, it was noisy from street/business noise. No blankets or heating (only aircon) - it was the coldest I’ve ever been, so we got no sleep. Body heat from my husband was the only way we kept warm. The free wifi was not working on our floor - & 2 calls to reception was no help. The room was so run down. Wallpaper peeling off. No curtains, only thin blinds which lit up the room with daylight early. The lobby looked ok, but was a whole different look in the room. The",1,1
"Claims of refurbished rooms, but only the top floors are updated. The other stories are disgusting. No wi-fi, ice machines are broken, and the bath towels are paper-thin. I felt sorry for the impeccably dressed front desk staff that had to apologize for lousy management. The first night we paid $353 for an old room with peeling wallpaper, dirty carpet that turned your socks brown, and with minimal furniture that looked like it had been rescued from a trash bin. The room had an old box TV that was at least 20-years-old and did not have a clear picture. While the bed was supposed to be a king, we are convinced that it was only a queen turned sideways as our feet hung off the end of it. After complaining to the front desk staff, we were moved to a slightly better room. The rooms",1,1
It felt like we were bothering the front desk staff when we checked in or stopped to ask any questions.  The room we had has character but that’s all I can say positive about this hotel. Wallpaper was old and coming off the walls.   Bathroom is very old.  The tub is stained and worn down to the core in certain areas.   The tub facets were on the verge of coming off if you pulled too hard.  Broken floor tiles.  Ice machine removed on one floor and broke on the other.  We like ice when we stay in hotels.    No continental breakfast.  This is definitely not the standard we are used to for the Days Inn chain.  Very close to subway line.,2,1
"The good:  Close to a subway stop. The bad:  Wet spot in the middle of the room, television didn't work, view of a brick wall, general state of disrepair, expensive, smelly, weird sort of maze, almost everything that could be stained in some way was, loud music playing from some rooms was tolerated.",2,1
"I stayed 5 nights at Days Inn Hotel on 94th St. The hotel, including lobby and rooms are badly in need of repair. Carpet and upholstery are so old and dirty it's creepy.  Owners are  taking advantage of a tight hotel market and their clientele Photos are deceiving. I paid an average of $343.00 per night. Amenities were zero. No place to put your clothes. - no dresser. Ice machine broken.  The hotel seemed full and the clientele was nice. Owners have no excuse to run a hotel like this. It's an open front door and anybody can walk in from the street and go up in the elevators. No security. Room phone did not work. This was a shock.",1,1
"I stayed 5 nights at Days Hotel on 94th St.  The location is good and I remember from previous years it was a good option.  However the hotel is taking advantage of a tight hotel market.  They charge top dollar ($193/per, had to be prepaid) and the amenities were zero.  I complained immediately as there was no dresser, one lone office chair, TV wasn't hooked up, ice machine broken, and the squirrel maze of rooms on the floor weren't clearly marked.  Only another desperate guest's pencil marks on the wall guided me to my room way in the back.  However you ARE in NY, there were no bugs, the rooms were cleaned every day, and the air conditioning worked.  They have a lot of nerve charging what they do for a room like that with carpeting in the room and throughout the halls from the",1,1
"Property needs renovations. Bathtub had rust, walls were patchwork both in room and hallways and windows were dirty. Current condition of property does not justify daily rates. Great location however I would not recommend it to a client.",1,1
"The title really sums it up. As two friends travelling to New York on a budget for long days of sightseeing, we just wanted to somewhere to get some sleep late at night before getting up early the next morning. This wouldn't be a place you'd go for a romantic weekend.  We stayed for almost a week and the hotel is in a fantastic location on the Upper West Side. The Subway is outside the front door, Central Park is a 10 minute walk away and there's loads of great bars and food places around.  When we checked in, NYC was going through a bit of a heatwave with temperatures getting up to 34 degrees (Celsius) and our room had no air conditioning. The sheets were ripped and the room was fairly dusty with dirty carpets. Thankfully, some air conditioning was installed after the second",2,1
"Stayed here during my daughter's graduation from Columbia University.  Rooms were disgusting. Had front desk change our first room because AC didn’t work, tub badly stained, holes in carpet and wallpaper falling off walls. Second room a little better but still issues. Lamp missing bulbs, old TV with terrible reception and hole in bathroom wall.  Windows only had cheap miniblinds so the rooms were not very dark so it was difficult to sleep.  Also very difficult to find rooms.  Hallways set up as maze and very little markings. The rooms were very pricey.  I've stayed in NYC multiple times and this was the most disappointing hotel I've ever stayed at.  I know Days Inn is considered a value level but I've paid less to stay in NYC and had much better rooms.  In the future I will",1,1
"This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The room is nasty looking, the carpeting is old and disgusting. The hallways smell like marijuana. The Wifi barely works, and there is no ice machine.   I'm not sure if I should even sleep in this bed. I will never stay in another Days in again.",1,1
"We just got back from our trip to NYC. We waited too long to book our hotel and ended up short on affordable options. The only positive I can say is that it was at least a safe place to sleep in. That’s it. It was filthy. Our bed had hairs in it. The shower was dirty. The carpet was disgusting. My husband and I were given two towels and one wash cloth (like total) for our stay. We never did find an ice machine. The hallways were dark, dingy and VERY stinky. Overall it was a disappointing stay. BUT for a last minute booking and a pretty cheap rate I guess it did the job???",1,1
"I stayed in many hotels in my life time and many in NYC this hotel by far has to be one of the worst in Manhattan! It was filthy, staff didn’t seem to care much and the entire time what temperature in shower fluctuated causing the water to get extremely hot. At a price of over $250 a night? They should Atleast steam clean carpets and whip guess walls... the pictures they advertise on there site are not this hotel. Maybe one or 2 rooms. I will never stay here again. Both days I had to ask for towels because they never left them in room.",1,1
"I checked in and left within an hour.  I thought there was something odd about the other people checking - one lady next to me was paying for her room with cash and apologizing for being late with her payment.  The hallway smelt as if people were cooking dinner in their rooms.  My room had no bed spread, exposed radiator, large stains on the floor and burn holes.  The floor in the shower was absolutely discussing.  I could have asked for another room but I was pretty sure the rest of the rooms would look the same.  Now that I see other reviewers had similar experiences, my gut feeling about other rooms being better seemed to be validated.  I dont know if this hotel is housing homeless people as another reviewer suggested, but I would like to have been warned that I was spending",1,1
very poorly maintained. Stay away. Hasn't been cleaned in a long time. Hallways are extremely dirty; Room doors are flimsy. Room furniture is way below any photo in any review. Wifi doesn't work.  Neighborhood used to be better.  Hotel accepts nightly guests from DHS.,1,1
"I booked this inn direct and subsequently checked in because I needed a place to stay near friends. I figured it was a trusted Franchise as a Days INN.  So you expect a three star quality.  Days Inn needs to remove their franchise from this immediately.  When I went to the room the hallway was very narrow dingy carpet and walls and not well maintained.  It looked like it has never had a paint job in 20 or 30 years.  I got to the room opened the flimsy door (not encouraging in NYC) The Wall paper looked fifty years old the faded prints matched the dated wall paper.  The carpet from the 80's with stains all over, the bathtub porcelain work large patches with rust in the tub. The chair on the desk used to be a desk chair it is a rocking chair.  The tv armoir was from the same era",1,1
"First, I must say that I acually didn't stay at this hotel. I was working in the area, so I walked in and asked about availability at the front desk. As I stood at the desk, I was hit with a very fowl smell. I turned around and notice two very disheveled people walking out. As they were leaving, the front desk woman asked for their vouchers and they told her they will get one later. That's when I found out that the hotel is home to many homeless people who sleep there using vouchers. Now, I'm very happy that homeless people get to stay off the street and out of the cold, but in my opinion, where they stay should be dedicated to them and not shared with others. Even though the room rate was reasonable for the location, I just could not stay there after that smell and knowing what",1,1
"This is a filthy, scary hotel, definitely not for families or the faint hearted!  BEDROOM (Fifth Floor):- Carpets were filthy and hadn't been hovered in some time.  The skirting boards were thick with dust, the blinds were snapped off, the air con didn't work, wallpaper was hanging off in several places, with an attempt in one area to stick it back down using a drawing pin, furniture scratched and missing handles off some of the drawers and the TV was from the 70's.  The beds were surprisingly comfy and looked like they had fresh bedding on them, but unfortunately, also had bed bugs!  BATHROOM - Tiled floor was cracked and sharp underfoot, taps broken, had grime round them and there was no hot water, shower, bath and floor were all filthy and had no place to put any toiletries",1,1
"Although the hotel is perfectly located near a Metro & Walgreens, it's quite filthy. My son woke up with lots of bed bug bites. We found that underneath the beds look like it has never been vacuumed..",1,1
"So. The Days inn hotel on broadway, what can we say?  Good point: the beds are comfortable.  Buckle up, here’s the bad points;  It’s dirty, and I mean, really dirty. I think it was last cleaned in the 90’s. We had the delight of staying in two rooms during our stay, firstly room 430 which was noisy, the windows were held in with gaffer tape and the heating sounded like a steam train. However the receptionist assured us that this was normal and that she would send an engineer to switch it off. Said heating was then switched off but after one night we requested a room change due to the dirt and street noise. I asked if the receptionist if this room would be better and she insisted it would so she must have known it was a crappy room...  So moving on to our second room, 510, which",2,1
"There are some positives about the Days Inn Hotel, the location is great. For starters, outside I heard no noise which for New York is great. In addition, the 96th Street subway is right next to the Hotel. The Subway goes to Central Park, Times Square, and Broadway. Which are all great tourists attractions. The Hotel lobby is pretty clean and the seating is very comfortable, staff was also friendly. Downsides of the lobby was they do have an exercise, which is good for workouts, but T.V quality was horrible and very few channels. Also, there was only two exercise machines. There are bathrooms in the lobby but the doors do not open and the smells were TERRIBLE. The elevators were fine a little slow and smelly but whatever. We got onto the top floor and the smell of weed was SO",2,1
The lobby is nice and the people are friendly however our room was in great need of renovation. The carpet was faded with holes and we had a 90's tv that would just shut off at random times and maintenance  looked at it and then walked away... Didn't fix it. The room next door sounded like a construction zone. The walls are paper thin... the 7th floor (we didn't stay on this floor) reeked of Marijuana and the elevators are very old and slow.,2,1
"Booked hotel for a week during Christmas 2017 and it was a complete disappointment. I booked and was charged for a non smoking ""double queen"" room because I needed two queen sized beds. When we arrived we were told that a double queen in ""hotel lingo"" means one queen sized bed only and that if I wanted two beds the price would go up $20 per night. I had never heard of that and explained it to the manager that my reservations were made and paid for a couple of months in advance.  After a lot of unpleasant discussion they agreed to give us a double ""full-size bed"" room for the same price.  When we opened the room it smelled of cigarette smoke, really strong. I had to go out and get air-freshener to be able to breathe there. Needless to say, after such a unpleasant experience I",1,1

I ignored this and thought to myself it doesn't matter I am in New York....however.....i came home to the UK and two days after being hone I tried using my bank card and it declined so I checked my bank and I had a charge from Days inn Broadway for £250 as I prepaid my room there had no reason to charge my card. I called days inn to be told they made a mistake I asked why they had even had my details out and been able to charge them and they couldn't answer me,I asked for my money back I was told the manager would call me back the same day,I received no call I have had to call to America again to",1,1
You walk in and surprisingly the lobby is quite nice the girls were friendly at the front desk but our room was horrible. You can immediately notice the worn our carpet.. there was water damage in the doorway between the bedroom and bathroom and the tv was from the damn 90's ... we ended up not even staying the night ..,2,1
"I found a ladies underwear in my bedroom. I think the visitors before me had a tough night. The room was full of dust, the window was bot able to keep the cool air out. I had to put my towel before the window so it minimize the cool air. It was not a pleasant stay. If you can stay at a other hotel and you need to pay $40 a day more, than you need to do it!",1,1
"One of the worst hotels I have stood at, the room looked nothing like the pictures, bed skirt was all teared up and sheet was stained. The TV was Older then I am, I was hoping to take a nice warm shower but had to wait about 15 minutes before the water got warm. The room smelled bad.. :( I really wished I would of spend the extra $30 or $40 a night to stay somewhere else. Too bad they wouldn’t let me cancel and get my money back so had to stay 1 night but defiantly did cancel the second. I have stood in many hotels and this one was by far the worst. Serious RENOVATION needed people!! And to top it all of parking was horrible $44 a night!! 👎🏼",1,1
"The only good thing is the front desk people and the subway nearby. The hotel smells weed and cigarettes and the lobby and the elevators are dirty. The room was clean but everything in it is too old. The tv has a few chanals with a poor quality, the bad was very uncomfortable, the bathtub need to be repared, it gets stuck all the time. We must wating for 15 to 20 minutes after putting the water on to have a hot water for a shower and in the bathroom was too much cold. The heating makes a terrible noise so you cannot sleep when it is on. So I realy do not recommend this hotel.",2,1
"I booked this hotel last minute. I read the reviews and thought I’d take a chance for myself. Anyone waiting my review don’t waste your money. The room was cold, you could not control your own temperature, the television was so old that it look like it was snowing on the few channels it had, and there was no extra blankets or pillows to be had because at  9 o’clock at night they were doing the laundry. The front desk people were nice but it wasn’t enough to make up for the terrible old rooms that this hotel has.",2,1
"Price was OK, but pretty was dated.  Tub was chipped, sink was chipped, plugs wouldn't stay in outlets (to loose), and found out the last night of our stay the lock on the door did not lock.  Room was not secure the whole time we were out of it.  Exposed pipes in bathroom, basically a kindergartner toilet (to small to use), and dirty black marks on the wall.",1,1
"First of all, ask for a renovated room. It will still have an old rug from the 80s but it WONT have is... peeling wallpaper, a dirty window with broken blinds, duck tape strips to hold the rug down, chunks of wood to hold the radiator in place and wads of tissue to hold the condensation dripping and an old bed. Wait for the hot water to kick in...after 10 minutes but hurry because it will get scalding ...hot/cold taps...who needs working taps?! Staff was somewhat friendly. One lady wasn't surprised when we asked to upgrade our room. Enough said... The perk is that it's a safe area and GREAT location 1 minute walk from subway station 1-2-3. Sorry, I don't have a great review for this hotel. We got what we paid for...New York is pricey and this was affordable for us.",2,1
"We stayed for five nights in December 2017. The location is great - 96th Street subway station is just outside, and if you manage to get an express train, you can be in Times Square in about ten minutes. The Upper West Side is a lovely area, full of interesting people and places, and with numerous good diners nearby. I would recommend this area to anyone who wants to explore Manhattan.  When we arrived, the hotel looked a bit shabby, but we got a relatively cheap deal so we were under no illusions about the fact that this is not exactly a five-star hotel. It was a little more concerning when we reached the ninth floor and found the hallways stank of cigarettes and cannabis - not great for an allegedly non-smoking hotel, and certainly not for anyone with allergies or respiratory",1,1
"We came in 10 minutes early and could not check in, I was told the room was not ready at 2:50Pm, my husband was double parked outside with his flashers on we waited another 15 minutes she checked again and still not ready at 5 minutes pass 3:00, then she just left for 10 minutes so from 3:05 to 3:15 no one was at the desk, finally two women came out and I upgraded my room because I didn't want to wait anymore. The room was horrible, we paid an extra $55 a day for the 12th floor where the heat you couldn't control, it was 85 degrees we had to open the window and turn on the AC to sleep and shower it was terrible . We found it was clean but very dated with stained rugs in the room. We will never be back and were very surprised it was a WYNDHAM property as I have a time share with",2,1
"The room was really small, and the rug looked old and worn. I was most alarmed by the tub which had permanent calcium spots in the tub.",2,1
"I have stayed here twice. The first time last August was fine. The hotel is old and needs updating, but I liked the staff and the lobby is charming and the rates were fair. The room was small and old but good, and location to my family was good so I booked again. Last weekend the check-in for a 3 night stay was fine and the staff competent and friendly. My 1-star is for after night 2: THEY DID NOT SERVICE MY ROOM!!! (This has NEVER happened to me before anywhere!!!) When I returned at 10 PM and alerted the desk, the desk person kept asking--3 times--whether I was sure I did not leave out the do not disturb tag.  NO I kept repeating, I was out by 8:30 AM I kept repeating. They did promptly bring clean towels and emptied the trash on request, but did not follow up with a garbage",1,1
"One of the worst experiences I can remember having. Very disappointing and unexpected in a Wyndham property. First room was dirty and in poor condition. After complaining, we were given a different room which was satisfactory but unspectacular (in addition, it had no internet access). For what the price charged, this was definitely not worth it. We will not stay here again.",1,1
"The room was dirty, run down, the ice machine was broken, I swear they had the heat cranked up, there was hair all over the bathroom floor, wallpaper was peeling off the walls,the list goes on. the parking garage for $27 a Day was full so we had to pay $104 + tax =$125.00 for 2 days. Suppose to have a handicap room, not available when we got there (I had called prior to booking a month before). Granted the location is good, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. Oh and we asked for wash clothes, got towels. I saw 1 cleaning lady in 2 days and her “cart” was a vacuum-NOTHING ELSE!!",1,1
Good Upper Westside location with Broadway buses steps away and the Subway a 2-block walk (as well as Riverside Park in the clement weather. But the hotel needs to be scrubbed .,2,1
"We stayed at this hotel while visiting NYC in Nov. 2017.   We had stayed there in the past but were quite disappointed at how run down it has become and will not be returning.  To balance this review, first the positives:  Great location, close to subway, restaurants, Central Park.  Safe.  Nice reception area and staff were ok.  The negatives: THE ROOMS WERE A DISASTER.  We actually requested a room change and the 2nd room was worse than the first.  Mould on the walls/ceiling, wallpaper ripped, carpet was filthy and threadbare.  No bedding other than 1 blanket and sheet.  No hot water, the towel rack fell apart in our hands, as did the clothes chest in the first room.  The second room didn't even have one.   Rust on the vents/pipes.  Stains everywhere. Rooms and hallways in dire",1,1
"First, it's shabby, dirty, run down and my first room stank of mildew. Second, I wouldn't agree that the front desk people are extremely helpful--not rude, but didn't really go out of her way to help me. Third, the TV and the phone in the room didn't work. (I tried to use the room phone to call about the TV, but ended up using my cell phone). When I first spoke to the lobby about the TV, she said that my room TV directory was ""out of date"" and I'd need to come to the lobby and get an updated channel list. So, I waited on the very slow elevator to take me down to the lobby and got the updated channel list. On the updated channel list, fully half of the channels didn't work. Called lobby again, and she said ""well, I could put you in a different room, but I can't guarantee that the",1,1
The front desk customer service was Superb!  Cudos to them!  But thats it!  Rooms were very outdated.  Windows were foggy so I couldnt even see outside my window.  I felt like I was living in the 60's.,2,1

Third time lucky room was cleaner,bed large and comfortable but it was over looking a building site, and work started at 7am !!!!  On the plus side staff were very nice and helpful and there’s a lovely diner on the corner.",2,1
This hotel does not offer parking at all you need to pay $40 per night not included in your cost of the room not a good deal rooms were filthy dust everywhere mold wallpaper was falling off the walls the staff was rude the worst experience ever,1,1
"I had to stay in NYC for an extra day due to flight delays, so quickly chose a hotel to get to with free WIFI so I could still get some work done with my office. Could not connect to WIFI from the time I arrived 3pm and time I left (5am next morning). Tried unsuccessfully to get staff to fix issue. I had to keep following up with them as no-one ever called back and finally, just gave up.",2,1

"Dingy, small. no amenities, halls were like maze, when you got off the elevator there were no signs indicating where room numbers were, noisy air conditioner, we paid for 2 nights, room was so bad we only stayed for one. TV didn't work and had to call the desk twice to get it fixed the first time then had to call again when we tried to turn it on the next day.",1,1
Good location is the only reason to stay there. The room was small and poorly light. The bathroom was very small. There was basically no furniture except for the bed and and a small desk. There was a straight back chair with stains on it. There was nowhere to put your clothes so you basically lived out of your suitcase. The WI-FI did not work. This place was a real piece of work. I would never stay there again.,2,1
"After departing from a nasty Air BnB we had booked and sadly paid for we had to look for a budget hotel and chose Days Inn. Very pleasant reception staff on arrival and during our stay, nice looking foyer. Sadly the room wasn't nice or pleasant however, in need of an overhaul especially the bathroom which was a bit evil and for some reason had no cold water just warm and hot! No fridge in the room just a space where one once lived. Hotel is close to Subway and not too noisy apart from the A/C units or ice machine if you are unfortunate enough to score that. Felt it was a bit overpriced for what you get. A spruce up with some paint or even clean grout would help a lot!",2,1
3 of us to a room. One double bed one single bed in a corner. Barely any space for our luggage.  Went and spoke to management to get another room they tried charging em 750$ per night that's MORE than what I paid for my flight and hotel together so whatever guess I have to slum it.  Bathroom was ridiculously small oh and we all got flea/bug bites.  Breakfast was included which was very small area and they ran out of food a lot it was buffet and some people couldn't have 1 or two sausages they had to have 6 or 8. They should have had someone serving so they didn't run out of food every day. We were here for 3 days I love New York and I'm here often. Usually staying in Brooklyn area with family. This location was great for Central Park and to subways to go to and from Times,2,1
Recently stayed here as part of a package asked to be close to New York central so that was the first disappointment as miles away in worst area I have ever stayed. Walked into Lobby to be meet by the worst smell imaginable made me vomit !!! smelt like cats and dogs had used it as a toilet. Given room key no help offered with luggage even though porter stood there open door to be meet by what I can only describe as the worst hovel and dirty smelly place ever. The room was falling apart literally and construction going on opposite room from 7am till 6pm loud jack hammering constantly. I complained and put it in writing but got no response from Hotel at all. No facilities at all no restaurant or bar so had to go out which I felt very uneasy to do as beggers druggies and general,1,1
"We stayed one week in the hotel, first 2 days in one room very very small where you cannot even open your luggage because of space, AC so noisy, old TV, bouble bed but I think for 2 children not for 2 adulds.We complain and we got a bigger room with an huge bed, much more space in the room. Furniture old like all hotels in NYC. AC is noisy in all rooms being the window installed one. Window cant be opened. Good thing: very close to metro station 96st, 4 elevators, cleaning good, good reception services, coffee from the house in the room, starbucks very close, supermarket under building, wifi quite ok.  Be carefully which type of room you book.",2,1
Stood at elevator for 10 minutes before another visitor told me this one not working.  They found out the day before.,2,1
"First - not an occasional globetrotter, have tons of experience with tons of hotels. The only good thing about it is the location. Not in the congested lower Manhattan area and yet minutes from it by subway, or an hour walk. Do not let yourself to be lured in by the photos of the old-NY style reception area. There is bad, worse, worst. And after that comes Days Inn. The room was stinky, moldy, dirty, clogged toilet, questionable power outlets (I was afraid something would happen every time I had to use them). The door served only as a visual blocking board between the room and the guests in the hallways, gaps all over, shaky. Moldy stinky old AC unit on the window. The room was facing the back side so every time we wanted to open the windows for some fresh air the only thing we",1,1
"Hi, My name is Bogdan B. I'm writing about the horror film taking place at the Days INN in New York. We have checked in september 1st, staying until september 5th/2017. I'm providing bunch of pictures from booth hotel rooms and halway as well (room #719 replacemt to > #431) To make long story short let pin point few things:  - we found cat poop in two different spots under the bed - very old, crappy AC unit with a black mold cover towel on the outside that got me and my 5year old daughter sick (whole room stinks as mold) - bathroom sink that once you use, you stand in water - destroyed, ripped, stained, dirty old carpets that make your feet black (disgusting to walk on) - construction side with scaffolding up to 8th floor - wallpaper that is coming off and ripped all the way",1,1
"The room I was given smelled horrible, like mold and was old, and has not been updated. There was a huge rust spot in the bathroom tub which was disgusting This room should never have been rented. I complained and was moved to a lovely and updated room on the 11th floor for the second and final night.I will never stay at this hotel again and will not recommend it.",2,1
"One example of the all around mediocre level of the hotel is the ""business room"" where the for pay computers and internet are slower then the free wifi on a Jet Blue plane.  Oh yeah, the free wifi only works half the time and only if you call the desk to reboot it.  To give credit where it is due, the help is friendly and helpful.  The decor is extremely tired, but is clean at least.  The in window air conditioners were up to the task although a bit on the noisy side. Almost forgot, about 1/2 hour after I checked in another guest that checked in later entered my room (1109) having been mistakenly checked into the same room!  That was a first!",2,1
This place is garbage.  the  room was small and there was no convenient power outlet to charge your phone.   The wifi in the rooms was not working. I was asked to sit on the lobby If I wanted to use internet !,1,1
"I get it.  NY hotels are expensive. But one expects a certain level of comfort for that $$. Days Inn is a run-down %#*& hole that hasn't seen any fresh paint, carpet, maintenance, or real cleaning in a long time.  Odors abound (there was likely mildew under that nasty carpet, and no amount of cheap perfume could mask it or the previous smoke - in an otherwise non-smoking room).  Bathroom fixtures were wobbly and at least 10 years old.  Bath tub needed a good scrub.  They definitely need to invest heavily in a serious face-lift, if they continue to charge anything over $100/night.  frankly, I think $79 would be all the place would be worth.  I read the reviews, and figured one night won't kill me (I had to stay in the area) but not again.  ""Location"" (or rather proximity to the",1,1
"Travelling is one thing I love doing and NYC was indeed a dream come true for me. Looking for accommodation was really tough especially in summer and good thing I was able to get a night at Days Inn after cancelling my reservation at The Jane Hotel which I find really too old, dirty and unsafe.   LOCATION. Very strategic. Literally near the train station when you plan to visit the Statue of Liberty, walking distance to CENTRAL PARK and just a short bus away to the TIME SQUARE.  Check-in wasn't rough esp. when you are greeted by a friendly staff. With my not-so-good and friendly experiences in other hotels in America, I would say this front desk staff named Jasmine was one of the bests...friendly and professional. Kudos girl (keep it up)! This industry needs you!   ROOM.  Well,",2,1
"I recently stayed here for 4 nights while traveling on business.  The place was recently renovated but doesn't look like it.  Two of my four mornings the fire alarm was going off around 6am and seemed to only be on my floor - no one was going outside and nothing was being done about it.  The free wifi was pretty inconsistent in the rooms.  The fitness center (if you can call it that) is 1 treadmill and one bike in the space of a small office.  The bathroom was large, but has the light switch on the wall behind the door opening.  You couldn't close black out shades so light came into the room every morning.  Positives: It is located in a good location close to subway and had a comfortable bed.",2,1
"The hotel is overpriced. The first room I received smelled was as if people were smoking inside at that very moment. I tried to call the front  desk to request a room change, but the in room phone did not work. I went back downstairs to the front desk, smelling like smoke, and asked for a different room. I was told that I would have to get a room on the business floor which was an additional fee. I had to except that, because it was no way I could spend another second in that smoky room. The location of the hotel was great, places to eat and the subway nearby. The people at the front desk were quite pleasant and helpful. Overall, the room and the bathroom needed an update and a thorough cleaning.",2,1
"The hotel is a good location. Laundry drop off across The street was good.    The room was very, very small. Woulda have been great for an individual, not a family.  They did provide us, with a complimentary roll away, which we sandwiched between the double bed and the wall.   They mentioned at check in about making sure we were comfortable with the room.   I figured that's basically what all the rooms were.   Needs updated badly, few tv channels, always had to ask for enough towels (only showed up once), bed was marginal and every morning was spent counting the bugs!",2,1
"Dark and dingy. The bed was a double, but seemed more like the length of a twin so I had to sleep diagonally. Also, the bed was not level so my head was lower than my feet. The air conditioning functioned reasonably most of the time, but was very loud and needed to keep running all night long. The wifi was unreliable and actually went down in the entire hotel for over 24 hours during our stay.",1,1
"Based on the other reviews about this dump of a hotel, I obviously got lucky and had a ""good room"" - a junior queen suite or something like that. $880 for 4 nights.  The location is great - there's a 1-2-3 subway stop a minute or so walk away. That's the only positive thing I can say.  The furniture in the room looked like the hotel bought it as a job lot from the demolition of a seedy motel in the worst part of some town. Two air conditioning units were so deafening it was hard to speak let alone here the sounds of the city. ADVICE: if you want a quite room, this ain't the place.  For the fours nights my wife and I were there, we were given exactly one 10ml bottle of shampoo - between us!  I was surprised that there was a disposable razor. For the first time ever I forgot mine.",1,1
"We stayed twice during a 2-week period, only because we could not book into a nearby hotel. The furniture, old desk/dresser combo, is awful. The second stay we had a file cabinet stuck in a corner. Few bathroom amenities, no washcloths, raggy face towels - we will not stay ever again.No wake-up call because phone was out, not fixed until during the 2nd stay, when another wakeup was asked. requested.The place is dirty, ice machines on only 2 floors.",1,1
This place was nasty    The maids went through our stuff and smoked pot in our room while we was out.  They would bring us extra towel nor fix the Ac    They charged us more then was told over the phone and more for parking then was also told and they told us oh well basically never again,1,1
"There were three things that kept me from giving this hotel a lower rating. First the Manhattan Diner just half a block away is AMAZING! Second is the 94 Corner Café - they have EVERYTHING and the pizza is fantastic especially at midnight after a long day in the city! Third, at least in our room, the bed was very comfortable. Other than that this place is HORRIBLE! It is beyond Filthy!! I refused to walk on the carpets without socks! We specifically called ahead to find out about parking our car and they said NO PROBLEM we have a lot - they don't have a lot, they have a garage. We drive a Suburban!! We were charged an extra $20 a day to park for an extra large SUV so $65 a day and not the $35 we were quoted on the phone to park in the lot they did not have! The hallways are SO",2,1
I would not recommend anyone to stay at this hotel as it was not at all what I expected...for the priceI paid it was definitely not worth it.,1,1
"We chose this hotel based on location and proximity to Columbia University, as we were attending our son's graduation. The room rates seemed very high 350 USD/night for a hotel with a 3 star rating on all travel websites, but the room photos on the hotel website looked modern and fresh. What a mistake. The photos on the website were an outright lie. The first room we were shown stank of smoke, had dirty carpets and a dirty hideabed (we booked a Queen suite as our son was with us), and the tiny room with the bed had the bed shoved against the wall with no end tables or lamps. The second room we were shown was only marginally better; again, dank smoke smells, dirty carpets, peeling paint, dirty radiator. The hideabed was horrible, sank in the center and the mattress was thin and",1,1
"We had two rooms on the premier floor, the 8th.  One room was WAY more premier than the other, both were severely lacking in just basic cosmetic fixes that would have easily bumped up my rating to average.  Stains on the carpet, peeling wallpaper, unusable hair dryer etc.  I've stayed in worse, I've stayed in better.  At the end of the day, I'd like alot more for my $300 whether or not I'm in NY, Erie, or anyplace USA.  $300 is alot of money and I expect more.  And don't be fooled:  indoor parking means a parking garage around the corner at $35 per 24 hour period.  Luckily we found street parking and it wasn't something I needed to deal with.",2,1

"The location of this Hotel was superb but the quality of the room left a lot to be desired! Wallpaper was coming off, the venetian blinds were broken, the lampshade was in shreds, the bath had rust around the end, the basin was cracked and so too were the floortiles!

The hotel was dirty there were Wallmark's a trash bin full of trash and a window air-conditioning unit with a cold beer came in there was no blanket it was just awful When we asked for the concierge there was no one present and no one can tell us what the closest church was the front of the hotel is true some trash bags and apparently there were people who lived in the hotel all the time I don't recommend this hotel the upper West side to anyone further I was told if we paid an extra amount of money we could be moved to the new were floors where everything was better this was not what we agreed upon The rate we found was found on Southwest Airlines through bookings.com I reported this to them and they did nothing be Careful,1,1
if you are looking for quality then this isnt the hotel for you...if you are looking for a budget friendly hotel to stay at with you being out and about and mostly being in the room a hour to 2 hours a day then its cool  Stayed here last year in a non smoking room and this year i stayed in a smoking room...night and day difference! Non smpking room tv mounted on the wall...nice desk rolling chair etc smoking room old flatscreen panasonic tv inside of a dingy and dirty dresser drawer dirty carpet dirty bath tub and the channel quality and reception on the tv is extremly poor! Its thw regular english broadcast with spanish people speaking over it and rather then the channels being clear its fuzzy as if it was running on a 1997 antenna!   Only good thing i will say is the front,2,1
I went with my sister mum and nephew 9 years ago  And we went back to hotel  Then around 10.30 a woman walked in with baseball cap and collar pulled up on coat  I jumped up and said what are you going in our room she replied sorry wrong room  I informed the manager next morning and she didn't care. I explained we could of been robbed!!! What's going on?? She walked off and wouldn't answer.  I asked a collegue and she wouldn't reply  So I don't know where it was genuine or why she got in our room but I wouldn't return. Not just due to the unwanted guest but also due to the flippant staff not taking my concerns to task  The hotel was nice hence me not giving one star.,2,1
"The whole hotel smelled strongly like smoke. The room was dirty (flies were flying around) and had old, ragged furniture. The bathroom smelled like bleach. The hotel was loud (thin doors).",2,1
I wish i had read the reviews before i booked. The staff were amazing and the bar across the road is fantastic. Its called whispers. These things were the only good things about this hotel. It kinda ruined my nyc experience. The smell of weed on the corridors is horrendous. I honestly thought the people who wrote this on the reviews were prob overreacting. They were not. I would imagine you would possibly get high if u stood in the corridor long enough. The rooms!!!!! I have no words. I have seen better squatter rooms on the tv. The carpets were so bad i had to wear my flip flops the whole time. Steer clear,2,1
"The hotel lobby was very clean. However, on many occasions the floor was dirty with stuff stomped into the carpet. The lift smelled badly of marijuana and occasionally could smell it on our floor and in the room. The room itself was disgusting, lots of attention paid to the sheets and bathroom but behind the bed was very dusty, the lamps had thick layers of dust, the plug sockets were unsafe as some were broken, furniture was all scratched and really worn, the radiator in the room was thick with dust and dirt, the valance round the bed was ripped, wallpaper was coming off of the wall. Some of the staff were unapproachable, I paid my room in cash and the boy at the desk took about 6 attempts at trying to count the money, which was time consuming and was rather annoying after",1,1
"We chose this hotel for location only as we were meeting family in the area. It is a basic hotel which we were aware of but it was very drab and tired looking in the bedroom & corridors. Lots of stains and old decor and not as clean as I would like. The first bedroom was reeking of tobacco even though we requested non smoking. Our request for another room was dealt with promptly without any hassle. This was adequate with a good shower and a comfy bed so we stayed. Noisy at night though with a bar opposite the hotel. We did have to ask for towels as there were none. The elevators also have a strange smell (marijuana maybe?). Not a hotel I would recommend with children. The positives are helpful staff, a nice lobby & good eating places nearby. Also close to Central Park.",2,1
"dirty, unmaintained, drab, confusing corridors , strange clientele . Reserved a room because of location. Big Mistake ! tv in room made in the 80's true antique. Scary people in the lobby. two lamps in our room were broken. Maid opened the door without knocking. and did not speak English",1,1
"For the two good points which kept me from rating this the lowest possible - good staff & good location.  Other than that this is an awful hotel.  Pictures are shown on their website and booking sites are of the nicer rooms you have to pay extra for.  If you don't you're put in an outdated, dirty and old room.  We could barely find our room because the door to our room was located through a door on the 8th floor in the STAIRWELL.  The carpet was disgusting, as in don't take your socks off.  There was a lot of mold in the bathroom and a dripping sink.  There was mold on the bed skirt.  Wallpaper is peeling, furniture is probably 20 years old.  There was no bedspread as shown in pictures of the hotel.  I'm really shocked the Days Inn parent company/franchise tolerates this.",2,1
"This hotel is horrible. The carpet is dirty and sink of bathroom is broken. The reservation shows free breakfast for two but instead they do not even other breakfast. When I checked out, the lady in front of me was asking the free breakfast for two thing as well. It seems a trick that works well for the hotel.",1,1
"This hotel is very well located, and fairly inexpensive by NY standards. Now the bad news, and this seems to be a universal problem, great foyer with plenty of uniformed staff, but scruffy rooms, too many staff whose sole purpose appears to be to hang around the foyer looking smart and not that interested in assisting customers. After taxes, it probably wasn't even that cheap. Why, oh why, don't hotels invest more in the rooms and less in flashy foyers?",2,1
"Our travel agent booked this establishment for us. So disappointed as the place is filthy and had the noisiest box window aircon ever. We have since read other reviews and seems our troubled stay is mild in comparison but none the less horrible. I can't believe Wyndam can continue advertising this hotel. Other than a laundry right across the road there isn't much going for this hotel. It's dirty, run down and the majority of staff it's a bother to them if you interrupt their day. Do yourself a favor and pay approx $100 extra a night and stay at a gorgeous establishment closer to Time Square. You will easily spend that each day catching cabs to and from downtown if you stay here. Plus very few places to eat and no restaurant facilities in hotel. Very very basic amenities. Feels",1,1
"Read poor reviews about this hotel and assumed other guests had just been fussy - how wrong I was. The hotels lobby is welcoming, and the location is decent - close to a subway (but everything's close to a subway in NYC). The room, though, was appalling. Dimly lit and dated, dirty bathroom and a a bath that wouldn't drain, plug sockets hanging off the wall, mold and damp on floors and walls, and a radiator that hissed and whistled through the night. Someone tried to get into our room at 4am so we couldn't sleep and felt unsafe. When I stepped out for a cigarette in the early hours to chill out I seemed to step right into the middle of a drug deal right outside the hotel.  We checked out as soon as we could and found somewhere safer to spend the rest of our time in Manhattan.",1,1
"I was sceptical after reading the reviews on here and then though to myself ""people only bother writing about the bad stuff"" right? Wrong! I wish I'd listened to what people were saying!  You are lured into a false sense of security when you arrive at the hotel, the lobby is nice and makes you think the rest of the hotel will be but it isn't.  My first room was like something out of a 1950s horror film. It was old, dingy and very very dirty - as in inch thick dust around the skirting boards, curtains that didn't close, tape around the windows etc - everything I'd read about previously and decided not to believe! We decided we only had to sleep there and would just deal with it. We went out but on retuning found water pouring through the light fitting in the bathroom from the",1,1
"So me and my family checked into hotel on 2/18/17,  got off elevator and smelled weed, room had mold, nasty carpet, toilet was running,the furniture was old and chipped,Checked out same day!!! Horrible condition.

My wife and I spent last Friday and Saturday night at the Days Hotel on the upper west side of manhattan.    We could have enjoyed our stay had housekeeping not taken or thrown out a bag with parts for a coffee maker and a new bag of Zabar's coffee.  When we phoned the hotel manager and house keeping and lost and found to report this.....we got no where fast...we left a phone number12 times...left messages 12 times and no one bothered to return our call or to investigate with the person who cleaned the room... why he or she took a bag with parts of a coffee maker and a pound bag of unopened Zabar's coffee.....it was either thrown out or taken for personal use.,1,1
"This was clearly a hotel being used as a welfare boarding hotel.  The room was smoky and filthy.  The hallway was boarded up.  The rooms did not look close to what was being advertised. False advertising, be truthful tom people who are looking for some place economical but nice",1,1
"There wasn't a day that went by that I could walk out of my room and smell fresh air. It was either the smell of cigarette smoke or marijuana, mostly marijuana so bad it knocked you down once the elevator opened up. The rooms were extremely outdated and left in the 90s. Bathroom was dirty and molded. I wish I could say the service was great but sadly that isn't the case either. When asked what could be done about the smell the first time they just brought a can of air freshener. The second time, hotel security came up to our floor and said it was because a window was open that there's no way there are actually people smoking marijuana in the hotel, pushed my concern to the side and left. Also asked for new towels and wash cloths because they didn't bring any during maintenance.",1,1
"Absolute mess. First thoughts were great as you get to a newly renovated lobby thinking excellent for the price. After that everything else was dirty and horrible and the whole place constantly stunk. Walk into the tiny lift that stunk of cannabis with little all inside. Then you walk down the hallway with the mouldy walls and wallpaper peeling, again stinking. As we got into the room the radiator was leaking and making a screeching noise. There was mould on both the floor and ceiling, telly was antique and had no remote. The sink was out of place and could see all the moulding sealant round the bottom. The door frame wasn't even on properly on the cupboard.  The place is an absolute mess if they spent the money they have on the lobby on the rest of the place the hotel wouldn't",1,1
"We stayed here for 1 night with children as it was close to a scheduled appointment in the morning. It was beyond terrible. The entire hotel was very smokey and lots of people hanging out in the lobby. The pictures on the site are not close to accurate. The room was gross, wallpaper peeling off the walls, dirt and whatever else just piled on rug and walls, beds unsleepable as they snuck in the middle badly. Not a place you want to take your shoes off for sure! Bathroom had a leak and the smell of weed was insane! Overall extremely run down and absolutely not a place to stay at with children.",1,1
"The location was excellent, but the place smelled of smoke and was not very clean. The carpet had stains, no microwave, and they charge $25/day for a small refrigerator. However, the staff was helpful and kind.",2,1
"This hotels saving grace is the staff who have been lovely.  It is close to the subway and Central Park.  The positives stop there.  The hotel stinks of cigarettes as some rooms are smoking rooms.  Our room was basic and very tired looking.  The worse part, it is absolutely freezing.  The bathroom is the coldest bathroom I have ever been in, socks are a must to cope with the tiles!! Wr have been cold in our very small bed at night.  We asked for more blankets which we were given but when you have window that is surrounded in black duck tape you worry, and the draft is more like a howling gale!!! When we arrived our room smelt of having been cleaned but with the over use of very strong air spray or product to the point it made us feel sick and had to open the windows.  Are door",1,1
The bed was really old the TV was really old the room looks like a motel room the elevator can only hold 2 people with lauggage. I was expecting more from this place it looks like the owner invest $0 dollars in this place. This place needs a big renovation. The staff were really good that is the only good thing about this place I ask myself if they paying them minimum wage???,1,1
"This Hotel is in the Upper West Side on W 94th St & Broadway, subway right across the street. Good location and convenient to all sites. The Big downfall:  Hotel is old and needs a refresh. Lousy internet, barely connectable, signal losted continously. Very annoying when you work online. Water takes about 7/10 min to get hot which is a waste of water. Not sure if I would stay her again.",2,1
"Myself and my brother spent 4 nights here in a non smoking room with 2 doubles. First impressions of the outside of the building was that it could use a bit of a clean, the signs were darkened by dirt and only marginally cleared when it snowed. The entrance and foyer were quite nice, clean and well kept. However it all began going downhill once we stepped in the lift. It was dark, dirty and stunk of marajuana. I believe laws in New York allow weed to be smoked but I think lines should be drawn when it affects the smell of the whole of the hotel!! There were small children in the room next to us for god sake! Our actual room forunately didn't smell of it but it was dreary, in serious need of updating and we needed to be moved to another room because of broken WiFi on that floor.",2,1
"Stayed here for one night. The place is extremely old and dump looking right from the get go.  When I walked into my room, I was greeted with hissing noises from the radiator and the smell of smoke, either from cigarettes or the radiator I couldn't tell.   This place needs to be thoroughly cleaned and updated.",2,1
"A few friends and myself were looking for something on a budget to try and get to NY during December.  This hotel is very basic and in some ways really lets itself down.  The first room my cousin and myself were given was through a fire exit door and it was an absolute tip.  I only looked in and walked straight back out and went down to reception and advised that it was filthy and I would not stay.  I had read that you could upgrade your room and we had tried to do that via the internet before we arrived but the hotel didn't respond.  We were eventually given a family room with 2 double beds which was nice for the two of us.  I have to say that the room was clean, and there was a maid service everyday.  It is a very tired hotel and a couple of the desk staff are not very nice.",2,1
"Now I don't do this very often but I'm actually sitting in the room now in resort writing a review, normally I will do this on a return trip.  Booked through British Airways I expected this to be a little better quality that first imagined, the hotel is nice to a degree but has lots of issues that make it not worth staying in my opinion.  To be fair we wanted a hotel that we could just put our head down as we would be out most of the time, this hotel has clean bedding and the bed is comfortable; however the rest of the room is somewhat not so nice.  So here are a few issues.  The Hot Water...  The shower is powerful but you need to let the water run for 10 or so minutes to get hot, you can be lucky but would seem this room not so lucky according to the maintenance chap.  The",2,1
"All day I enthusiastically walked the city with family members, and was so looking forward to a hot, relaxing bath, and then some rest. My feet and calves ached. The tub stopper did not work. Could I try a foot soak in the sink? No.There was no sink stopper. Hot showers did not stop the muscle spasms, and so I had a sleepless night. Such a shame, because everything else about the city and my contacts there had been perfect.",2,1
"Let me start from the top. The young bell boy who helped us from the time we got out of the cab with our luggages is the most effective staff of this particular hotel.  Upon arrival at front desk, we inquire about upgrade. Lobby cost is triple the price to do it on my phone app. Worst. They can cancel your current check in so you can get the upgraded room for the lesser price on phone app. But it's pass cancellation period. Prior to asking if there is privileges for being a platinum tier of group: Not really. As explained. Guest should be wis enough to know that as per CSR. Main problem. Upon our entry to the room, it is cold. We turned on the a/c that goes to 85 degrees, still cold wind comes out for more than 30 mins. I'm not gonna go to detail but this is our complaint",1,1
"This hotel may have been great at one point in time but now it's severely in need of renovations. The photos advertised for this hotel are not accurate based on our room's presentation.   Pros: What saved this hotel from a one star rating was how nice the staff were. We were checked in quickly and they held our bags until 10pm.   Cons: To be frank, our room was horrible. When we arrived the bed sheets were wrinkled and untidy. The bathroom was very old and our towels had hair in them. The TV was also old....I'm talking the huge block shaped TVs before flat screens were invented. Only 5-10 channels tops. Even though the heat was on, the room remained cold and there was barely a comforter on the bed. The window as so dirty it had a white hazy frosted look, so no city view. In",2,1
"My sister and I traveled to NYC to take in the holiday sights. We had four fun packed days planned! On our arrival, we checked into the Days Hotel on Broadway and 94th.   Another family we knew we also staying in this hotel. Our room was on a floor that had not been refurbished. The other family was on a redone floor. Our room had no frig or microwave, broken tv, telephone that did not work (you had to email the front desk), and only one towel. We were only in the hotel to sleep, and were quite comfortable as long as the air conditioner was on high (it was 20° outside).  I would not recommend this hotel for your NYC stay!!!",2,1
"Arrived for the weekend 2 adults and 2 kids. Found the hotel in a very accessible location a block from the 96 st subway station. The room was OK but in a second glance you can notice a need of a renovation or at list a cote of paint over the doors, the shower was not appealing with scratches and marks on the tubs flour and on a cold night like ours was, you had to wait forever for hot water. While I was waiting to speak to the front desk I heard other complaints of heating that doesn't work, misplaced parcels and other calls... Oh, and there was a party on PH level, we did not hear it in the room but the common areas were very loud.",2,1
"As a traveling professional I've stayed at a myriad of hotels and never have I stayed in a hotel room as bad a shape as this one. No heat/hot water, no thick comforters, broken tv and the most dangerous was the metal bar protruding from the mattres that ended up cutting my leg as I slept.",1,1
"There were cockroaches in our first room !!!!  In the bathroom , on the pillows it was awful , thankfully we were  given a new room which had been slightly updated, there was a new bathroom fitted.  This was not my best hotel experience , we booked through booking.com for six nights and it cost us €750 (euros) for a double room with bathroom, board only, which for New York is not badly priced.  However keep your expectations low the hotel is old  and grubby , the hallways and stairwells are overbearing with cooking smells I don’t know if guests were cooking or if the hotel has long term residents  either way it wasn’t pleasant.  Our room was old but an improvement on the first one which was comparable to a scene from a Bugs Life, our bed was made up every day but our bin was not",1,1
"The quality of the Days Hotel Broadway on W. 94th St. in Manhattan was deplorable.  I booked through hotels.com in advance and that was unfortunate.  I had little leverage with getting any money back while staying at the hotel.    When I arrived on Dec. 7th I was in a room where the wallpaper was peeling, the A/C had parts missing and operated poorly.  The TV was from the 90s and the remote did not work.  Both sides of the mattress had metal prongs sticking out that jabbed your skin as you got in and out of the bed.  The night table had a drawer with a missing handle.  The carpet had major stains and tears in it.    I requested another room the following morning as they were booked fully the night I arrived.  That was an inconvenient experience as I had to leave my bags at the",1,1
"Hello I have stayed at many hotels  and being in my mid forties I remember getting cheap rooms for 50 bucks to just party in as a kid.  This was the WORST room I ever stayed in. Bath tiles loose and falling out rusted sprinklers on ceiling , paint stained chairs a lamp powered by extension cord running across a quarter of room.  Lamps falling apart , wall paper that they must have repaired something and did a poor job to patch it. It was all peeling and falling off wall ,  pictures show flat screen tv on wall we got old tube tv.   Bed came with just white sheets no blanket or anything on it had to call and ask for one  . The Ac let in cold air on us all night. The heat didn't work.  It was bad I am so disappointed in this hotel. The lobby is beautiful and as soon as u step onto",1,1
"My husband, my 3 year old son and myself came to the days inn on December 9, 2016. When we got off the tiny broken down elevator the smell hit us like a ton of bricks. The walls were filthy with stains all over them. When they opened the door to our room we were in shock. It was the most disgusting hotel room I've ever seen. Wallpaper peeling off the walls, a hole In the wall. Blinds were broken and cracked. The heater on the floor was layered in inches of dust and dirt. The air conditioner was filthy, the tv was old and didn't work, the mattress had holes in it. The floors looked like that hadn't been vacuumed in years and the smell was awful. We immediately had to find a new hotel room and fast. So we had to re pack the car and pay more money for another room. I was afraid to",1,1
Kids got bit up by something and bath tub was clogged causing dirty water  to stay n tub water didn't get hot either,1,1
"I've stayed here 3 times because it's cheap and convenient to where I need to be, but will have to look around because I. just. cant. stay. there. again. The ""good"" rooms have the purple under-bed prostitute lighting, pleather headboards, and enough toxic air freshener in the air to make you cough, and in all of the rooms I have stayed in I feel like I need sanitize everything that I own after staying there. This time was the final straw where the entire floor (stained carpet, bizarre dirty cubbies, and dark/dank/peeling paint aside) smelled intensely like vomit, so much so that I almost followed suit. My boyfriend went down a floor and said we should consider ourselves lucky based on the smell of the floor below us was of other bodily fluids that if possible was worse. TOTAL",1,1
"Would not recommend this not even for ""cheap"" price! What you get here is: - careless staff  - noise from everywhere (we could here a few rooms away's intimacy as they were in the room with us) and constant beep sound that we couldn't place where it came from -hot boiling shower that doesnt change temperature (or you burn yourself, or you burn yourself, no choice!!) - room service left our room open and we realized after a whole day away, luckily we had put our valuables in the safe!! And my luggage, left closed by myself, was found open too, maybe to put my clothes back in there ?!?  - we decided not to get room service done anymore because they were not giving complete reset-up  - Elevators noisy and slow - None of the three vending machine worked, one of them just steals",1,1
"This hotel must be one of the worst in New York,the room smelled awful. The carpets in the hall ways were discousting,the paint is pealing off the walls.the T.V in the rooms are from the 90s. I would never stay there again.",1,1
"Called for room service three times, to request a blanket, no one answered. Rooms were extremely cold. You could hear other people's conversations. We had a non smoking room, but the hallways smelled of cigarettes. Bad first impression.",2,1
"I have to assume that this hotel is undergoing renovations so some get clean modern rooms and some get beat-up rooms with sad mismatched grandma furniture, carpet with mysterious stains, and the kind of bathroom that make you keep your shoes on.   My son and I got the second kind. It was probably meant to be the room designated for wheelchair users. It was big and had a roll-in shower with a plastic bench. The bathroom floor was so uneven that I'd be afraid a person with balance or mobility issues would go down.   The room smelled vaguely of smoke and air freshener. There was no wifi. The TV was the chunky kind.   The elevator smelled smoky enough that my clothes stank. There was wifi in the lobby. The employees at the desk were nice.   Based on my experience, two-and-a-half",1,1
"1THE HALL WHERE MY ROOM WAS SMELLED OF CHINESE FOOD..  The desk staff was not friendly. The floor I was assigned to smelled of Chinese food. The room had yellowed sheets and did not look clean. The front desk reported that they did not have a different room. The hotel's manager was curt and uncooperative. I asked for a cancellation for the week's reservation and for the night as I was only in the hotel for 1/2 hour and found it unclean and smelly.  He told me that he would take care of it but never did as it showed up on my visa card.  I thought the Wnydam hotel chain would be superb and so I thought I would try this hotel. If they know about the staff and lack of service resolution, they would cancel their name from this location. My experience almost ruined my visit. I hope",1,1
"We needed a hotel near Mount Sinai Hospital.  Our reservation was for a queen bed standard room but we received a double bed standard. The room had no heat and the hotel told me that heat wasn't scheduled to be turned on for a couple days and there weren't other rooms available that night but to check back in the morning. My husband was under cancer treatment at Mount Sinai and unable to sleep the first night and the internet did not work. The hallways and room was full of very worn out carpets, peeling wallpaper, and broken off plaster. You could get a contact high in the elevators. The next morning we were able to move to a king bed room at the same rate, still without heat but the hotel placed a portable heater in the room which made everything much better.  The bathrooms are",2,1
"Please do not stay here. The staff are very nice but the hotel is terrible. No services, the room I had smelt bad and was in desperate need of repair. There is nothing positive except the staff. No curtains in the windows, blinds that are broken",1,1
Checked in at this hotel and was given a room key went to the room we was allocated expecting a 3 star room and was confronted with a run down room in the far corner of the hotel across an old dirty stair case with a filthy carpet an old bent metal blinds to the window so went back to reception to complain that it wasn't up to standard and was offered an upgrade for an extra $200 but negotiated $160 so saw this as a SCAM because saw it with my own eyes only a couple of days later at the reception with some more guest and since getting back home read some reviews and a lot of bad ones,1,1
"The temperature through out the entire hotel was very warm, and elicited poor odors from the carpets and bedding. The staff behind the check in desk was slow and did not do the best job at accommodating the number of guests who needed assistance. The hotel was a bit dingy, and very dark, in need of a remodel and some open windows. I wouldn't stay there again unless I absolutely had to.",2,1
The hotel room was clean and the housekeeping was very good. However the rest of the hotel was extremely poor. There was an awful smell in the corridors and carpets were dirty and stained. Walls were marked and the hotel needs to be renovated. I wouldn't stay here again.,2,1
"First time coming to new York and I loved the city. I'm very disappointed by the hotel bc it smelled like smoke. The pictures were nothing like the actual hotel. The elevator was very small and had a long wait. We couldn't find the stairs. They didn't even have flat screen tv. They didn't have central air, just the air conditioner that is in the window. We spent most of our time out of the hotel because it sucked. No housekeeping. They didn't have a parking deck. We looked at a brick wall when looking out the window.",2,1
"Well located, reasonnable price for New York City, in a nice and quiet surounding but has to be refurbished completly:  safe never worked, telephone booth in the lobby down, ice machine down, air conditionning very very noisy...",2,1
My daughter and I stayed here for 4  nights.  The hotel is completely run down it is in need of a complete revamp.  The foyer was grubby and the funiture was aged.  The lifts on the right side of foyer are smelly and grubby.  On entering to the room the key lock would not work and we had to keep calling reception to come and let us in!  The windows you could not see through because they were filthy. ..no curtains up just blinds that were broken.  The bed linen was clean however they put blankets on the beds which to me is a big nono! ! The decor is grubby and the one chair that was in the room had marks on it so not sure if you wanted to sit on it or not.  The staff were not interested in you as a customer the moment we arrived it was a matter of securing a deposit of  $100 and,1,1
"I was in NY to visit a sick family member. Her husband and brother rented a room in this hotel (7th floor)   Due to the late hour, I stayed a few hours to rest before heading home. The first thing I'm going to say, is room was very run down. The WORST THING is THE  HALLS , and OUR ROOM reeked of Marijuana. It was horrible!!!  Almost uncomfortable to stay, but because of circumstances, the room already paid, and it being after midnight, it was unreasonable to leave. I would hope that management takes better care of monitoring the facility.",2,1
"Finding a reasonably priced hotel in Manhattan is an impossible task at the best of times.  I stayed one night at this hotel recently.  I was appalled at the condition of the reception area.  The floors and carpets (where there were any) were dirty and worn.  The floor of the elevator was also depressingly dirty.  The corridors are a maze.  The room was spartan but (thankfully) clean and the bath was adequate but with an ugly brown stain near the bath tub drain.  The air conditioner was so noisy that I had to turn it off and endured a night in a too warm room.  I find it hard to believe that the owners and management cannot find it in their budget to correct these flaws.  On a positive note the location, near transportation and multiple restaurant options, is fine.  The desk",2,1
"My friend and I stayed at the hotel a few days ago and we left two of our hoodies in the closet. We called on the day itself but was told that the manager had left for the day and was advised to call the next day which we did. We called and they asked us to leave a number and said that they will call back once they've checked. We waited for 3 days and no news. Called back and on the first call they hung up on us, and when we called again the person on the phone told us that they didn't find anything.  First of all, we are very sure that we left our hoodies in the closet, thus I'm sure someone from the hotel must have taken it.  Secondly, they didn't even bother to call us back which they said they would!  Terrible service!!",1,1
"All I can say is this: It never even crossed my mind that someone in the hospitality industry getting paid to interact with customers would hang up on me, and then when confronted about it, lie to my face.   And the room was in very poor shape. Wallpaper peeling from walls, stained carpet, and a very worn out shower (with a broken showerhead). The wireless internet service did not work in the room.  I will never stay there again, and will actively tell friends they should look elsewhere.",1,1
"Terrible. Dirty elevators, shabby narrow corridors, worn furniture, noisy window A/C, carpets you will not want to walk on with your bare feet. Amazing that a global brand, even a budget one like Days Inn, has allowed a property bearing its name to get into this state. Also amazing that NYC allows a hotel this run down to continue trading. Avoid getting a shiver down your spine; book somewhere else.",1,1
"We stayed here for 5 nights, putting some exchange issues we had to the side, it could have been better. When we arrived we thought the reception looked really nice with a great Art Deco feel to it. Then we got in the lift which was quite old and broke down a few times whilst we were there. Our room was in the stairwell so anyone walking up and down the stairs walked right past our door which we could hear. It offered quite a few channels on a flat screen TV but we were treated with 4 channels on an old box tv. The best thing about it was the fact there was a 24 hour cafe across the road.",2,1
"I fly to New York every month, and I've stayed at this hotel twice, only due to location and price I picked this hotel... So here is my honest opinion...   Pros:   1. Lately the rates have been between $120-150 per night, for NYC in the summer, that's a plus! I wouldn't stay here If the rate was higher.  2. Rooms are roomy compared to your typical NY hotel.   3. Location is great! There are shops all around to eat and grab a quick bite.   4. My 2nd visit I left my id in the car, the receptionist was able to verify me by my previous reservation which was nice!   Cons:   1. The room appears clean as long as you don't move anything around or look under the sheets. It's grimmy and is not sanitary. There were stains all over the mattress and double mattress  covers. Desk table had",2,1
"Awful quality in general. Lifts took about 20 minutes every time you wanted to go up and down, including just to get ice on the floor below as they have no fridges. Lots of things were broken old or just plain dirty. The top of the wardrobe was caked in dust. The traffic on the street below can be heard super loudly on any floor (we stayed on two different floors) as they have no double glazing. The shuttle service is also dangerous. We watched a couple panic and have to take a taxi to get there plane on time as the taxi was so late and both the driver and the concierge were super rude replying ""you are lucky it was only half an hour late"" and the driver had no idea how long the journey to other hotels would take. Also I think a roller coaster is more comfortable the van had",1,1
"This was the second time the internet didn't work in the room. The first time, they said ""someone"" was coming over to fix it. The second time, they said, ""Well, it's sometimes slow in the rooms. You have to come down to the lobby to get WiFi."" When I asked for a partial refund, they said the manager will look into it. Never got a penny back.",1,1
"Elevators are not enough. One of the days there were only 1 out of the 4 of them working. Ridiculous. Really in bad state, needing an urgent renovation.  Cracks in walls, doors, toilet lid... everywhere basically. Dust everywhere too. I took many pictures of it but apparently there´s no option to attach them. Shame  I was scared of walking barefoot on the carpet.   Windows don´t insulate at all, specially the sound.  We were in the 12th floor out of 13, and the traffic was so loud we thought the windows were open.  The air conditioner left a funny smell, really bad.  I wouldn´t be surprised if the filters were really dirty and had some bacteria spread.  Employees are useless, they will lie as much as necessary to get rid of you   One of the days the woman next door locked her",1,1
The best thing about this property was the location to our friends who live locally. Room was quiet.  The front desk person was not friendly nor welcoming.  Elevators sometimes worked and if they did they took forever to get to your floor.  When we walked into our room we had one towel - one hand towel.  Shower could not maintain a specific temperature.  Carpet was ripped and needs replacement.  Wouldn't go back.,2,1
"All right, it was a last minute booking during the summer tourist season. And the lobby was all right.  But Room 300 was just a dump.  Uneven floor covered by a ratty dark old carpet, poorly fitted AC with grill partly missing, chipped furniture, everywhere a feeling of decay and poor maintenance.  Someone else's hair in the night table.  Yuck, yuck and yuck.  Unpleasant experience and bad value.",2,1
"This hotel has everything you would expect to find in one of your worst nightmares: disgustingly dirty carpet, wallpaper falling apart, useless AC, extremely noisy and even... insects! And I had to pay 230 dollars (!!!) for this ""paradise"" (for one person!). I have only one advice: run away...",1,1
"We spent two nights at the Days inn, do not be fooled by offered rebates, our room was shaby. Small, damp, ultra basic. Shower was a mere trickle w/o the benefit of hot water. We mentionned it to desk staff twice and got the ""polite BS answer"". It is worth paying a bit more to get a proper room and staff who actually care about their clients.",1,1
"Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel lobby was decent but outdated but possibly The nicest looking area of the whole hotel. The elevator and hallways are small and appear dirty and outdated. The hallways were hot but the room was cool thankfully from a window unit.  When we entered our room the blinds were dirty and rusty, the bed sheets looked slightly from what looked like mascara marks, the tv was not updated, the bathroom pipes made lots of noise but the bathroom was fairly clean and functional. The bath tub drain did not drain well. There was a blow dryer in the bathroom and the bed and pillows were comfortable.",2,1
"I have stayed at a few hotels in this area, for the same rates.  This was dingy and needed attention.  Furniture had a lot of nicks, wallpaper seams opening up, shower had cracks in tile and did not drain well.  Water was above ankles showering.  AC loud, and do not look out the window- it was very dirty.  Mattress was old, like a spare in a home -Not comfortable.  Location is fine, near places to eat and the subway- I liked that.",2,1
"I have stayed here numerous times because it's usually affordable. I used Priceline.com to book the room. Almost every time I go there, the shower has no hot water and I have to switch rooms (if possible). It happened again. I paid for a queen size bed, and received a single size bed! The room was near the staircase, and for some reason, people were coming in and out of their room all night and slamming the door. The hotel is in a good location with many stores around. I actually live in NYC, and just stay in hotels for a change of scenery. The Days Inn is a good place to sleep, but that's all I can really say. The elevators are cramped and slow. There is nothing special about this hotel at all...",2,1
"And just that.  I am no stranger to the cost of living/staying in New York, so I understood that for less than $200/night, this wasn't going to be The Ritz-Carlton.  However, I did expect a bit more than this hotel delivered.  Upon arrival, there was a long line for check in with two employees moving roughly at the speed of molasses.  I had requested a fridge for my room (not included in the room price, but available for $25) and was assured that it would be sent up shortly.  The elevator was very small (my suitcases had to be sent up in another elevator because the elevator was not big enough for 2 suitcases and 3 people) and moved very slowly.  I had booked a queen room for my 3 year old son, infant daughter and me.  It was TINY - barely enough room to navigate between the bed",2,1
I had to exercise extreme patience just to get service to check in.  When I was finally helped (after listening to the complaints of several other guests ahead of me) the host thanked me for being patient and 'upgraded' me to a King bed on the 'premium' floor.  The room I was given had a small queen bed with a pink neon light behind the headboard (assume for the 'premium' ambiance).  There were no towels or any soap/shampoo/conditioner in the bathroom.  There was no coffee packets to put into the coffee maker and the cabinet for a fridge was empty.  I think this place must be used to renting rooms by the hour...,1,1
"These reviews are absolutely correct, the website pictures do not reflect what this hotel and the rooms actually look like.  This place is very run down and not kept up well.  The owner should be ashamed of himself/herself! The best thing about this hotel is the staff.  Even when they were dealing with angry guests complaining about the conditions of this place, they handled it professionally and graciously.  At over $250 per night for our stay we were first given a room that was so run down and smelled so bad that we asked for a new room (which is not typically for me to do).  Then the WiFi is slow and/or unreliable! The elevators are slow and tiny! The televisions only have about half of the channels that the hotel guide claims to have.  The hotel was incredibly disappointing,",2,1
"Negatives outweigh positives...... NEGATIVES: 1)Pictures of rooms do to represent the 5th floor where we stayed 2)Room was non-smoking and was, however hall reeked of cigarettes 3)Room was ""TIRED""....peeling, old wallpaper; holes in walls; 1960's 19""old TV with a fraction of supplied list of channels; worn furniture;window air conditioner  4)Shower temperature fluctuated between cold-scalding about every 30 seconds(depended on someone flushing toilet somewhere in hotel?) 5)Toilet would get stuck running; overflowed once  POSITIVES: 1) great area of town: subway across street; CentralPark about 3-4 blocks away 2)Room was quiet and comfortable 3)Personel nice and responsive",2,1
"New York is New York and you should not get your expectations too high for hotels...unless you wish to spend big dollars.  I have stayed at many Days Inns over the years and have generally found them to be serviceable hotels that return the quality for the price.  This experience did not meet that expectation.  The property is milking money out of rooms of yesteryear and in need of some true renovation.  To be specific, the door to the room was barely lockable requiring a slam to get it to latch.  The linens for the bed were torn and should have been replaced.  Bath linens were of a quality that I would have expected at a minimal cost hotel.  The TV was ancient.  The real issue for the room was the plumbing.   For some reason it had a ""extra"" set of valves and was not in any",2,1
"The room smelled, plastic broken blinds on window, radiator held up with a piece of wood, safe in closet didn't work, very thin non matching towels in bathroom. Tan tub had white porcelain paint for repair. Save your money and stay somewhere else!",1,1
The hotel is in terrible conditions: - Dirty Room - Terrible Bathroom - Poor bathroom features - Broken door lock - Black tape in the windows - Old TV from the 90's - Very slow internet connection - No kitchen or any food services - Ok Service The Hotel pictures are 100% not true. Is very expensive compared to quality. The Hotel should be 1 star and it should cost 50 dollars.,1,1
"the internet was not working at all and the rooms are not clean, carpet is frankly disgusting and I wouldn't walk on it without shoes but it's cheap and they do offer smoking rooms and the staff is pleasant. it's better than the Hotel Pennsylvania but that place is a total nightmare.",2,1
"Was coming back from Canada and chose to stay at this place at NYC. It is centrally located and very close to the train station and convenience stores. Now coming to the quality of the hotel.  Once you enter and reach the reception area, one will realize that this is a very very dated property.  The moment I entered the elevators with my luggage, realized that booking and paying for stay here was a BIG MISTAKE. The elevator had a very strong nauseating odour of rotten fish+ stale air . Room was on the seventh floor and coming via the elevator  was a torture during the course of stay. Also, the whole 7th floor had this strong strong smokey cigarette smell as if someone is burning a whole box of it by the hour. Not aware if other floors had the same smell but requested the",1,1
"We arrived on a Saturday afternoon after 12 hours of flight time and airport transfer. From the outside, all looked well. Check-in was quick and easy, the reception staff were very friendly and although the reception area looked a little tired, we could see nothing of any concern.  We had a double room on the 10th floor. On leaving the lift, we had to go in search of our room as there is no indication to its location but as its not a huge hotel, we found it after a short while.  Our room was one of two next to the stairway. We knew things were bad as soon as we opened the door. The room had a very musty smell, the carpets were filthy to the point I would not walk on them without footwear and there were a number of loose floorboards that made a loud clunk whenever you walked over",1,1
"During my stay here we noticed the hotel was very much outdated and absolutely needed a HUGE renovation to all rooms, beds, walls, phones, TV's, doors, hallways, amenities in the room, & etc. Elevators were extremely small and had to take the stairs (which was not a big deal). Definitely disappointed especially traveling from California but we realized that were paying for the location NOT for the room and that did not sit well with us. Got woken up one of the nights in the in the middle of the night by other drunk guest pounding on our room door which is out of the hotels control but thought they should know. Front Desk didn't accommodate us on a 1 pm late check-out which was very inconvenient for us. The parking garage that the hotel told us we can park at for a discounted",1,1
"The main problem was the room was not what we had expected (as we have stayed there before) and there was no mention that we could get a handicap room. The second major problem are the elevators. They are WAY too small and the additional or secondary elevators have been out of service for 2 years. This should be a priority for repairs. Lastly, internet service, while free, is the worst I have ever encountered in a hotel. I used my own hot spot internet from my smart phone to get service. The issues were with the hotel, not the staff. They were all very professional, trying to deal with some things that may not be totally in their control. Housekeeping was very accommodative and friendly.",2,1
"My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights and were not really expecting much, as it's a Days Inn... It certainly didn't deliver. We went on a search for vending machines the first night and learned that there are only three in the entire 13-floor building, and all were on separate floors. Each floor had its own distinct odor, none of which were pleasant, and all of which were cigarette based. We moved as quickly as possible whenever we had to come or go. The first morning I got up and found that we had no hot water. My boyfriend later saw that there were two master control knobs beside the toilet that controlled the hot/cold mix, but even after adjusting those, it was next to impossible to control the temperature while showering---it would fluctuate every 30 seconds or so.",2,1
"This may be the worst hotel I ever stayed in.  Since it is a Days Inn I had low expectations to begin with but they managed to not even live up to them.  The room they gave us was not on a hotel floor but was in an emergency stairwell.  I filed a complaint with the NYC Building Department as there is a question if that is even legal.  They advised that in 2014 this hotel had numerous safety violations including improper fire stops.  The room itself was terrible.  Nothing like the pictures.  When we showed the picture to the front desk clerk and asked, ""Where is this room?"" she laughed and said, ""Oh we don't have any rooms that look like that.""  The bed was horrible, towels in the bathroom were not clean, and the mold on the window blinds was disgusting.  The bathtub had an old",1,1
"This is a completely rubbish hotel, despite all the assurances given by Curt, the front office mgr. about how hard they are striving to improve, in other reviews.  All of that is complete fiction.  Room 826 was filthy, the staff was completely indifferent, and if I could give it negative stars I would gladly do so.  There were burn marks in the carpet, hardened gum deposits in the carpeting, a ring of dust/dirt around the baseboards and the decades-old furniture was scratched beyond repair.  The room looks out on an air shaft, so it is hard to tell night from day.  The windows are filthy.  The elevators are creaky and slow.  At over $300/night including tax this is an insult to the word hotel.  Flop-house would be a more accurate description.  It is a great location across the",1,1
"Not sure where to begin... Best to arrive by cab, no place for your car. An address to a local parking garage is provided. Two blocks, right turn, right again, then left, then right.....then walk back to the hotel. No doorman to help find a cab...walk to the corner and do your best. Phone buttons do not work. Seriously, To reach anyone you must select O- Operator. Front Desk- no answer, Housekeeping -no answer. We tried every button, nothing. Glad we didn't have an emergency! No blanket. Have never been to a hotel that did not provide a blanket. Bed was clean, sheets and a layer so thin it was nothing more than a thick sheet. Usually you would expect to have a spread on the bed or an extra blanket in the closet. Nope. None of the above. Had to call the Operator to reach",2,1
"We made a reservation weeks ahead for a family event, arrived at 9 am and left our bags because our room wasn't ready--which is understandable, but they would not check us in. When we came back later we were given an awful room literally in a stairwell. The manager would not change our room, saying they were full. But we were there at 9 am! And they would not check us in. Customer service is awful. Room is awful. Price is high for this kind of room and treatment. Go somewhere else!",1,1
"I had concerns regarding security,due to being placed in a room that was not connected to the lobby. I had to go in an isolated area to get to my room.This was not a good fit for a female traveling alone. Also, I placed a do not disturb sign on my door and it was ignored.",2,1
This is the most disgusting place I've ever been too. Dirty and smelly all at once!!! On the first day we walked to a dirty room ( floors were dirty and bed sheets were not clean)!! Manager said he would come unblock the bathroom and gave me my own blankets to redo the bed myself!!! What kind of service is that! The tv in the room didn't even work..... Let's just say this is not the place to stay if your headed to NY!! KEEP AWAY!!!!!,1,1
"Check in went smoothly, but it was downhill from there. There are 2 very slow elevators serving 13 floors and after coming out of the elevator I was greeted with the strong aroma of food being cooked.and found my room was located in a stairway. The room itself was small as expected for New York and furnished with a double bed, two night stands with lamps, a desk with lamp and a chair and a combined TV console/ 3 drawer dresser. The desk extended into the room somewhat blocking one of the night stands and was so close to the bed that it was very awkward to be seated which meant that most people ended up sitting on the bed. Enough people had done this that the top of the mattress had shifted about 5 inches from the bottom of the mattress creating a mattress with an overhang on one",1,1
"It is a good cheap hotel and its location just perfect for someone who wants to explore New York City. Actually it is the best in my opinion if you want to spend all the day outside, it is old but clean but our room was very cold the heater was not working properly. There were a breezes come from the window and there was no free breakfast and no good TV channels. It is near to subway station, pharmacy, good restaurants and vegetables and grocery shops. It has two elevators which are not enough for a busy big hotel, the employees were very helpful we enjoyed our stay there we spent four good nights.",2,1
"We stayed in an unremodeled room.  It said it was non-smoking but the hallway stank of smoke.  The bathroom was barely clean, the hot water was impossible to regulate.  No cable.  Requested to be on the same floor as my mother and sister - called and requested several times, all parties requested at check-in and yet we were still on 3 floors.  As a family of 5, we told them we would come in very late and please hold two rooms next to each other.  They didn't.  We were on either side of the elevator shaft.  Fortunately, when you go to NYC, you don't spend a lot of time in your hotel room.  Apparently, we could have gotten some sort of breakfast deal at a local café, but we were not ever told about it.  I heard them tell another guest when we were checking out.",2,1
Premium Rooms are high in price but smaller than the base rooms. The staff at the front was very rude. There wasn't a manager on duty to answer questions. Refused to accommodate my wife's medical conditions. Still had to pay the first night because it was cancelled which is understandable but I would have been better to pay if the staff wasn't so rude. Location is a dump. The rooms smell the elevators are uncomfortable and smelly. The door was falling apart when we got there. Overall it was a very Nasty experience. There is a hotel in time square that was $50 cheaper and we received a larger room and it was a much much nicer facility. I do not reccomended this days inn.,1,1
"The room smelled a little, not sure if it was because of a filter on the in-window unit. It was a musty faint smell. The carpet had stains all over the place as if it hadn't been shampooed in  while, I didn't feel comfortable walking around in my socks, let  alone barefoot. Lighting was horrible the room was not inviting and dark even with all the lights on. The bed was old, so old that you could see clearly the indentations of where people sleep. It wasn't comfortable at all definitely needs to be upgraded. Another much needed upgrade would probably be the TV it was an old CRT(tube) tv that was hard to watch because of the grainy picture. The bathroom door was broken, a clear glass shelf was being held in place with paper to secure it properly and there was screw holes and",1,1
"Pros - Location: It is a block from 96th street subway stop, so basically the express 2 and 3 train, and local 1 train stop there, quick hop to basically anywhere. Also, it is upper west side, so it is basically a residential neighborhood, no tourist traffic, no loud noises at night. There are CVS, Walgreens, Starbucks, Subway, restaurants within a block, extremely convenient.  Cons - From the fire escape route map on the door, it seems like I am in the smallest room on the floor, I don't know why, I didn't book thru a third party, I didn't bid my own price on priceline, I booked it direct from the wyndhamrewards.com, but that's ok I can accept that, what I can't accept is since this is a Days Hotel vs the normal Days Inn, I thought the quality would be better than Days Inn",2,1
Room not ready. Rude check-in. TV did not work. No Amenities. Had to ask for a blanket in the middle of winter.,1,1
"This hotel is not great, but it is in an excellent location.  The room was fine, very dated and old, and in serious need of a remodel.  Amenities, not really, but it does have wifi and a tv.  The attraction to this location is proximity to the 1, 2, 3 trains.  You basically walk out the door and you're there.  And this is on the UWS so you have a ton of great dining and drink options.  Try Tal's for a great bagel.  Don't stay here if you are trying to impress a date on a romantic weekend.  Do stay here if you plan to be out of the room except to sleep and want to spend your money on activities, dining, and shows.  You can find this hotel for under a hundred bucks on many sites.  Spend a little more to get something better?  Maybe, but this was a good enough, dated, no-frill",2,1
"My husband (53) daughter (9) and I stayed here from the 28th till the 30th December 2015.  We're from Scotland in the UK and were en route to Florida for a birthday celebration for our daughter and decided to squeeze in a visit to New York.  If I had been staying any longer I would have shifted to a different hotel, only decided to stay through sheer exhaustion.    The Days Hotel could give the prison service a hint or two on how to accommodate inmates as that's how we felt upon our departure/release!  We arrived at the hotel with lots of bags but no sign of any assistance was on offer ~(the concierge was busy having a chat).  The reception desk had 2 female staff when it came my turn to be attended to they proceeded to chat away to each other in Spanish while I was standing",1,1
"This hotel was booked for my sisters 40th Birthday. When we arrived at the hotel, we were upgraded to a ""penthouse"" room due to the occasion. Do not be fooled by booking a renovated room because it's not worth the price you pay. The rooms are very small, although very clean but are old rooms with noisy radiators that making hissing air noises all night and the heat out of the is unreal. Despite staying in January when some nights it was -7 degrees outside the room was far too warm. We contacted reception for the heating to be turned off. Lewis the engineer came to the room and advised us he has now turned the heating off so that no heat would be in the room and all noises would stop. Lewis did nothing, he had no tools with him. It took us 5 requests to get the heating to the",1,1
"I say probably as we didnt get past the lobby, and headed for the door. The staff were prefectly friendly, but the lobby had a dirty rug, dilapidated, old bits of furniture lying around, uncleared cans lying, and you needed a card for the rest room, which had signs of the door being kicked in. There were signs of despair and hopelessness. However it was bargain basement, and so I suppose if you are desperate..",2,1
"Upon check in for a potential three day stay at this Days-Inn in Manhatten NYC off of 94th and Broadway the lobby and staff appeared to be of exquisite taste; even the advertisement offered on the lobby's electronic screen displayed the same, but once past the lobby the revelation beginning with exiting the elevator on the 9th and especially the10th floor the place was the ""beginning of a facade of a vacation disaster."" The hallways reeked of a fishy smell. The other elevator was out of service and had a window on its door that had a bullet hole with an ""Out of Order,"" sign posted that was written in marker on a plain white paper. Upon entering room 1012 which was our children's room a dingy couch meets us, with what appeared to be a blood stain, the window base of the walls",1,1
"If you value your life, stay away. This is the WORST. The hotel only has 2 tiny elevators. You ride up and down after long waits with hotel trash. Two larger elevators are inoperable - the staff says they're being repaired. They have been inoperable for longer than the elevator in The Big Bang Theory. The Internet has been largely inoperable for years. When you ask about it, you're told ""it's being fixed right now"". It's also been broken for years. The cable has fewer channels than we had in the 50's. When you ask about it, you're told it's being repaired. For years. The chambermaid stole a couple of cans of sodas and some toiletries from my room. When I complained, I was asked to produce receipts. The night security guard doesn't like for guests to stay in the lobby -- so when",1,1
"I would not stay in this hotel/back packers place again, when we booked in and went to our room it was old and smelly, the bath was stained on the bottom, the sink was cracked, the TV was from the 60's big and bulky, the wallpaper was coming away from the walls, the carpets were dirty, the hallways smelt bad. We called up and asked for another room and had to pay an extra 40USD each night and we were staying 6 nights. The building creaks during the night and wakes you up. The Internet is very slow (but free). We would not recommend it.",1,1
"They say they have WiFi but the rooms have a terrible connection. i could hardly attach a doc on my emails and send it. also terrible elevators, take for ever to get one! good prices for that area....",2,1
A more accurate description would be a hostel rather than a hotel. Run down grimy noisy grubby awful. Staff were friendly enough but no facilities in hotel worth talking about. Not a great place to stay tiny rooms with no views and really noisy decrepit air conditioning. I will never be back.,1,1
"We arrived after midnight and had to park our own car three blocks away, a little nerve wracking for us senior citizens.  The non-smoking king room we reserved was a queen with smoky hallways all the way to the air-conditioned room without no extra blankets.  If we turned the AC off we smelled the smoke.  There was no hot water and the water pressure was negligible, certainly not enough to rinse out shampoo.  Even when we called to have the shower fixed, it was warm for about 5 minutes and then went ice cold again.  One bank of elevators was out of service and the only working one was slow.  After 20 minutes of waiting, we opted to walk down six flights of stairs with suitcases.  The worst, though, was the feeling that we were being judged as unreasonable.  The second",1,1
"The only thing, besides the staff, thats good about this hotel is it's location. Right there on Broadway, 2 blocks from Central Park, underground right there and on Manhattan. The elevators took forever, lets face it: the place needs an upgrade -  considering the price! Even the wifi needs a serious upgrade.",2,1
"I travel with a territory of North America and with that have the opportunity to stay at many different hotels.  I have stayed at this establishment before, but regret that in both stays, I was not very impressed.  The room is worn, shower floor is black from age, floor near bathroom felt like it had experienced water damage and all they did was cover it. Water pressure would go from warm to ICE cold to BURN hot all while taking a short shower.  In NY it is hard ti find a cost effective hotel and if budget is your thing, this might be the place, but I would look a little deeper before pulling the trigger for this hotel",2,1
"You get what you pay for I guess, but I was surprised at how rough this hotel is.  Wallpaper peeling off the walls, frayed carpets, stains, a bed with lumps.  I didn't pay a lot for it, but given that this is a Wyndham property I really expected more.  Lovely lobby but other than that, much rougher shape than other older hotels I've stayed in while in NYC.",2,1
The lobby is very nice but that is the only part. The room and hallway is very dated! There is an old layer of filth that seems acceptable. It felt like  I went back in time or to another country. Everything is old and rusted. I didn't want to take of my shoes or put anything down. It was very uncomfortable. I felt like roaches would carry me away in my sleep. If you like nice things or not being disgusted try somewhere else!,1,1
"We stayed here for 7 nights.  When we checked in, one of the receptionists told us that there's some sort of technical difficulty going on and there would be no wifi available at our floor (13th) And promised that there would be a technician coming in the day after to fix it. For the time being, we should use the wifi in the lobby (still, it was really slow. And we couldn't use it for anything at all) Asked another receptionist the next day and this time they came up with another excuse, and apparently there was no ""technician"" coming in that day.  Every single time we asked them about the internet, we got told differently. So basically for the whole week we stayed here, in the 21st CENTURY, there was absolutely no internet.  After checking the reviews on tripadvisor, this lack",1,1
"Apon arriving at the hotel I was told the wifi was having ""issues"". Which apon gazing apon past reviews, has been the norm for some time now.   And that only 1 set of elevators was in service; and of those sets of elevtors only 1 went to the top floor.  When I got to my room there was an ultraviolet light under the bed like some sort of wierd love hotel.  The wifi on the top floor never worked so I waited 10 minutes to reach the ground level where it was meant to be ""better"". The wifi on the ground floor was terrible also; too slow to use. I had to keep using starbucks wifi my entire trip.",1,1
"It met the minimum only because the bed was comfortable and we got a good night's sleep. Other than that, it was a real disappointment. The internet didn't work. There were only two small elevators that left many people waiting for long periods. Promised amenities (such as a morning newspaper) never appeared . . . the little things just kept piling up! I got the impression that ownership is milking this facility for as much as they can get before they dump it.",2,1
"I have been in this hotels for 5 times now. This time will be my last one. I checked in for two days and received a room outside the emergency exit. It's one of the rooms (I guess there is one on each floor) which is only accessible from the exit stairways. The door could be opened without keys because the lock is very old and broken. I went down to the reception and complained. They gave me another room which was not outside in the stairways but it was almost as terrible as the room before. Because it took me more than 30 minutes to get another room, I did not go down and asked again. I slept there for a night but decided to check out a day earlier and stay at another hotel. When I told the woman from the reception that I'm going to check out a day earlier because my room was",1,1
"I am an experienced budget traveller. I am happy to have a room & not expect more than a bed & a bathroom as long as it's clean.  I paid approx £800 for 6 nights here. My first impression of the room was 'wow this is big.' I opened the blinds , nearly choked on the dust & immediately noticed that they had not been cleaned recently.  The wall paper was peeling off & there were dirty marks all over the walls. The carpet was tatty all the way round the edges. Looked like the room had been self catering at some point as there was a random sink in the room & empty kitchen cupboards, there was a big uncarpeted tatty square which I assume used to be space for a fridge?  As mentioned above, I budget travel so had a bit of a giggle at the shoddiness but was a bit miffed this was the most",1,1
Rooms are 1/2 the size of a typical hotel room and the bed looks like a double and not the queen I expected. The furniture is one star but clean. Towels are simple with basic amenities. Only one elevator as others out of order. It would be fine for the incredible shrinking man movie.,1,1
Stay here at your own peril! Thought it was far too expensive for a shabby run down and out of date establishment! Not worth the money! The wall paper was blistered and peeling! The TV was from 1992 and to top it off their were charges made on my credit card that I did not authorise and the same to my sisters card by some scam holdings company! And we are with different banks! So not hard to work out what was going on there!,1,1
We stayed ay Days Hotel Broadway for 3 nights for 500$ (we paid with credit card) and they asked an authorization of 400$ more (as a deposit) without saying anything! This is really unbelievable cause I found myself dealing with an unpleasant situation: traveling for a month around the US with 400$ taken from my credit card for 20 days!!! Please stay far from this hotel.,1,1
"The rooms are very clean and well maintained, this is the only plus.   Being an international traveler with short visits, one of the major criteria for selecting this hotel is free wifi.  This hotel promised a free room wifi, and upon check-in I was given a unique wifi login n password accessible from my room that later turned out to be a sham.  The wifi wasn't working at all and upon checking I was told to use the business center wifi ($2 for 8 minutes) which was quite disappointing.  There is no cafe n hence no breakfast options, the hotel covers just lodging.",2,1
"I would say that the whole place needs a face-lift. The elevators are ancient.  Only two of them were operational. Rest two were out of order. It would take you 15 minutes to reach the lobby from the 11th floor. You can hear the bathroom taps running. The rooms are shabby too. The view leaves a lot to be desired.The positive thing about the hotel is its good location. Staff is extremely helpful. Nearness to the subway is another merit. For the rentals they charge, it is important that they improve the quality.",2,1
"Just stayed in New York for 5days at days inn....location not bad mcg too subway which is easy too use...get 7day pass which u can use on any line at any time on 32dollars well worth it!.... The hotel has seen better days but the bed was clean and very comfy!.. The staff were very unhelpful and quite rude at times....for that reason wouldn't go there again or advise people too go there!!!! As for new York fabulous place but have comfy shoes.....lots of walking!! Best too eat hard rock cafe very good service....also by the days inn the dinner called big daddies amazing breakfast definitely worth a vist....also Madame tussads, top of rock China town empire state building.....a show too but be careful were get tickets from shop around!!!

"I've stayed here for $99 a night, and been willing to overlook old, grungy hotel with elevators that rarely work, non-existent WiFi, TV with 3 channels....etc. In September, paid $250 nightly (way too high for this place,) and when I wanted to extend stay, rate jacked up to $475. To earn those kind of dollars, Days Inn needs a redo.",2,1
"I really don't understand why people rate this hotel positively.  I was not expecting a big deal, considering the price, I was expecting a simple place, but this is an awful place.  The halls smell, all the towels and sheets smell like cigarette. We asked for a non-smoking bedroom, but they probally wash the sheets and towels of the non-smoking and the smoking all together, so it all smell like cigarette. The mattress was really really bad. The only good thing about the bedroom was the bathroom, that was clean and wide.  The wi-fi is NONEXISTENT, They shouldn't even advertise that they offer it.  As vistors, we needed the internet to search how to get to the places, restaurants and buy tickets online, but we couldn' t do it tonight at the hotel , we had to go to Starbucks, that",1,1
"Frustrating! Weird smell in rooms and lobby, dirty walls, doors and carpet. Broken elevator. Unfortunately I paid 5 nights in advance.  Good luck with internet!  Nice staff, thank you Graciela for your help.",1,1
"The room I stayed in (room 712) had a horrific smell of mold. The sitting room was dark, had a lumpy, old, multiple iron burned carpet with an equally old couch. Bedroom was pretty much the same. I found myself awake at 2 am with a screaming headache (likely due to the mold smell). This room should not be used. I can't speak to other rooms in the hotel, but if I had another option I would have preferred leaving the hotel for another and eating the night's cost ( cheaper than other hotels in the area but by no means cheap at $300+ per night). Bad news.",1,1
If you want to wait for an elevator and then get stuffed in withe to many people choose this hotel Poeple were waiting with their lagguage for 25 min to get an elevator The staff is friendly but the owner ......... Fix the elevator,1,1
"Had higher expectations for this hotel as we had just stayed at one of the same name in orlando that was a lovely stay. However, this hotel is very dated and in need of some repair.  Just in our room: TV did not work properly Air con was very loud that it woke us up more than once through the night The free wifi did not work  The bed was small - our feet hung off the edge The bed was not very comfy Lots of masking tap around the room holding bits together No light in the wardrobe/room with safe Carpet was dirty The door didn't seem to close properly  Furniture looked like it had seen better days All of this didnt give good first impressions!   we were on the third floor, only one set of elevators were working which would take a long time to arrive if they were at the top and",2,1
"I did not enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Very old rooms,TV and AC . Weird smells. Long lines to use the elevator. No breakfast. Very old carpets and the walls in need for new paint. The invoice was wrong and it took me a week to get a correct one.",2,1
Smelly. Filthy. Carpet filthy And worn down. Bathroom door didnt close. Wires tapped to the wall. Noisy useless air con. Old. Run down And badly maintained. This place should be closed down. Avoid or go And be very disappointed. The pictures they show are not what you will get. The Wi-Fi is very weak And frustrating. The TV does not have cable. Like they say it has. Very BAD experience.,1,1
"The good: Relatively inexpensive, OK service and nice UWS location adjacent to subway station...  The bad: This is a dive of a hotel, that while not dirty or unsanitary per se, has that ""perma-filth"" that becomes embedded in properties that are old, poorly maintained and never updated/upgraded. Industrial fans in guest floor hallways in lieu of AC, poor lighting, old ratty furniture and linens, cracked tiles and damaged fixtures in bathroom, etc., etc... Also, zero access control/no security or visibly working camera system. I entered and exited unacknowledged and/or unnoticed several times; would not feel comfortable allowing a female member of my family to stay here alone. Perhaps fine for international budget travelers and those who are accustomed to ""roughing it"", but to me,",1,1
"Our room was on the 8th floor. The good: the people; the location; the bed in our room. The front desk personnel, the concierge,  and the housekeeping staff were knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. The location is super convenient, particularly if you know the subway system. Lots of close, reasonable restaurants nearby. The Symphony Space is right around the corner. Our bed was clean and comfortable, the unrenovated room was simple but OK.  The bad: wifi was *horrible*!! Could not hold a stream; kept dropping. Very annoying and very inconvenient. Had to unplug radio and lights to plug computer into the room's very few electric outlets. (Maybe this is better in the renovated rooms? But at an additional $50 per night, did not want to find out.)

"If the room hadn't been paid by the conference organizer who invited me, I never would have chosen the Days Inn in the first place. Unfortunately, the negative reviews are right: this is a rather depressing place. The carpets are dirty and reek of smoke, the wall paper is stained and peeling down, and the plumbing seems to be in want of repair: In the adjacent room, the toilet was flushing every two minutes and then shutting down with a lout thud. Also, the mattress had a deep gap and the sheets were too small to cover them fully. The only good thing about this hotel is the location on the UWS.",1,1
"Everything about this hotel was unpleasant.  The rooms were very small, and dirty.  The elevator was so tiny, I think the most people we had on there was four people.    There is maid service but there was popcorn on the floor under the tv stand, and chocolate chips on the desk chair.  Went to take a shower, it took 5 minutes for the hot water to arrive.  There was no one at the front desk.  I stayed one night, anything longer than that would have to require a free night or have the room steam cleaned from top to bottom.  I will not and do not recommend this hotel.",1,1
"I read the reviews prior to booking and thought it would be good.  I was super disappointed with what I got.   I stay in NYC frequently on business and I'm used to small rooms.  This room was located on the 4th floor.  It was very out of date and incredibly dirty.  The light switch in the bathroom looked gray with dirt.  The toilet was clogged when I checked in. The floors were dirty.  I was only there for one night, and thankful that I didn't have to stay longer.  The hallways were incredibly narrow and the floors were split into two sides.   All I could think was if there was an emergency, it would end with mass casualties.  One exit sign actually pointed the wrong direction!  Very thin walls--could hear a baby cry on my floor.   Two VERY small elevators that take a long time",2,1

I did my booking through booking.com and got a confirmation email stating that the cancellation fee would not be charged if cancelled one day prior the arrival date. I specifically chose this option as i was not quite sure about the dates my family gets to the US, so that just in case i could change or cancel reservation. Although i was charged immediately 250$ out of 800$ that i'm supposed to pay on arrival. I immediately cancelled everything in order to get the money that i had no intention to spend before arrival. I called the hotel and in a very rude way they told me that they meant it, and this is how their business works",1,1
"The price is right for the location of this hotel, but you should be aware that it has many problems and you have to endure many annoyances during the stay. We experienced a constantly running toilet, very uneven floor surface (divots covered with carpet), interminably slow and tiny elevators and spotty room service.

The good: Nice comfortable bed and good location next to subway.  Overall this is a poor hotel. If you looking for basic outdated rooms with good access to the subway then this is for you, otherwise please go elsewhere",2,1
"So I've had the very same issue twice with this hotel. Their own website clearly states early check in at 12:00pm, late check out at 2:00pm if you purchase the ""club room"".  It does not say subject to availability anywhere. I arrive to check in for 12:00, room not ready. Same discussion with staff as I had a few months ago regarding the early check in with the room I booked. They stated they were unaware of such details, until I showed them these details...on their own website. Even if you call reservations to book the ""club room"" they advertise early check in. Previously I was compensated for this issue, so no big deal....mix ups happen. But now the second time regarding the very same issue.  After waiting 2 hours for my room...found some stains on the sheets. Yuck. And just to",2,1
"Within moments of walking in to this hotel, it becomes clear that the owners are gouging this place for every penny it is worth, while spending as close to nothing on the upkeep as possible.    This hotel is riddled with what a surveyor would call ""wants of repair"".  Not a single item in the room was unscathed.  Cracked bathroom tiles, a bath which had lost its enamel and gone rusty at the bottom (needs to be seen to be believed), smell of cigarette smoke throughout, 3 out of 4 elevators broken at any one time, stiflingly hot atmosphere, chipped and broken furniture, holes in the walls, peeling wallpaper, cigarette and sundry other burns on the carpets; I could go on.  If this hotel were $50 a night then the condition might have been okay, but it wasn't.  We paid $200 a night",1,1
The room was not cleaned properly. It was freezing cold. My credit card was scammed within hours of arriving. Apparently this is a common occurrence at this hotel. When I complained to the manager he was not interested. Said he had Signin the lift. Yes small sign which everyone travels with their back to. Do not stay at this hotel.,1,1
"First we had to switch rooms a total of 3 times. The first room had rust in the bathroom which means it's old and needs to be replaced. The second room had a huge stain on the floor and it smelled really bad. We settled for another room because I really didn't feel like going to every room in  the hotel to find one that I liked. There's no hot water most of the time it only gets warm and you have to leave it on for a while for it to even get warm. The room was cold apparently someone left the window open. The engineer put tissue in the window by the ac to keep cold air from getting in, WHAT? The room keys stop working after a while and you have to keep getting new ones.  Guest service is sometimes rude like it's my fault things in the room aren't working. They have over priced",2,1
"1)Problems with the booking reservation,  2)they charge more and i needed to discuss for them to reimburse me for technical problems of their staff. 3)ONE ELEVATOR for lotsssss of people , 3 times i waste 25 MINUTES waiting for the elevator, because the others were out of service 4) I BEG and really asked for good internet in my room when i was checking in, i really ask for it, and the receptionist said the internet was ok in room 916. I called minimum 20 times EACH DAY for 7 days to say wi fi was off. For all of this...HOTEL IS NOT RECCOMENDABLE, even if the price is ok ( terrible location)",1,1
"This is worst hotel experience. The heat was off and it was freezing, and called the front desk and they said they would call EV to turn the heat on. It never came on. I called again and spoke to someone different and they said the same thing. They came and bring some blankets they brought 6 blankets in total which didn't help at all. And in my bathroom, had no towels or wash clothes.  I had to wait for 1,2 hours for they to come. The hotel tv only had 3,4 channels.  The hotel was dirty it had spackling on the floor, the wall paper was coming off the wall. The elevator was broken. Stay away for this HOTEL...STAY AWAY",2,1
The pictures of the hotel on groupon make it seem like it's a decent place to stay but when you actually get there it looks nothing like that. My room was disgusting from the stains on the floor to the dirty sheets.,1,1
"The hotel staff was friendly and tried to be helpful as much as they could, but they could not control the fact that people actually live in the hotel.  The hotel does not advertise as a hostile and that is exactly what it is.  The floors that have not been renovated(1-9 or 10) have dirty carpet and dirty exterior walls.  For the price I did not expect the Taj Mahal, but for an inexpensive NY Day's Inn I  did expect a clean looking exterior to compensate for the older rooms.  I did not expect the smell of smoke or food cooking.  It served the purpose, but I was not comfortable and felt slightly unsafe. If you are looking for a regular hotel with just vacationers or temporary visitors this is not the place.",2,1
"We booked a room with a queen-sized bed but the bed was only a double, despite the queen-sized headboard. Also, the toilet plugged with little toilet paper. Overall, this is a very old place in need of renovation. On the plus side, the staff is friendly and the location is great. Next month, I'm staying at a place that is similarly located, similarly priced, and offers a complimentary breakfast.",2,1
"Spent two nights here over Thanksgiving. We chose the hotel because it is about three blocks from the apartments where we'd be spending most of our time with family. We are native New Yorkers, and while other visitors may appreciate the relatively quiet, residential Upper West Side location, it helps to know your way around Manhattan if you plan to stay in the neighborhood.  The room was small but relatively tidy. The bed was fine. The bathroom was clean. Those are the pluses.  The minuses were many. The reception area was criminally understaffed, especially for a high-traffic holiday weekend -- it took forever to check in, the computer system was balky, the vibe not very welcoming. There were quite a few foreign guests with limited English, and the few staff members were not",2,1
"First off I have to say the pictures they provided are totally misleading! My room looked nothing like the rooms depicted in the listing. My wall paper was peeling, there were water damage spots on the ceiling, loose footing under the carpet, and just plain dated looking. It was like a scene from a movie where the bad guy had to find a place to hide out, complete with the small tube tv and sirens outside every hour. 2 of the elevators didn't work, and it was quite a good wait for the other two elevators being that they are the older model, cramp elevators, and we're not hiking from the 8th floor everytime we want to get into the city. The cleaning staff wants to work on their own schedule, never mind that you're still occupying the room because it's 9am, and you're not ready to",1,1
Old city hotel with no upgrades. Parking is a block away and still expensive. Some of the elevators were broken. Room had a window AC that was very noisy and room heat was uncontrollable so AC was required. Expensive for the quality of facility.,2,1
"It's a good thing that there arre tons of things to do in NY because I was not about to spend time in what is for sure the worst hotel room I ever paid for... The room was tiny, noisy, the furniture really old. The TV didn't word (and I figured later hadn't worked for a while and the manager pretended that it was just a temporary problem...). Don't get me wrong, I don't visit NY to stay in my room and watch TV but there's a minimum: I paid for a room, not a cave! The air-conditionning is so noisy it's no even funny. The window was not weather-proofed and on top of everything, there were dead roaches in the staircase that remained there the whole time (4 days) despite my mentioning it... I stayed in this hole in April 2014; back then, the building was supposedly being",1,1
"I understand that it's in NYC, but the room that we stayed in was tiny, expensive and not that clean. We called ahead of time to make sure we were going to have the right number of beds, but when we arrived we were shorted one.",2,1
"My firm is always looking for decent basic hotels in the city for our technical team.  This place is horrible run down dirty.  Internet us useless so can't do business, we had to spend nights at Starbucks to get any work done.  Place is dirty.  This place has been permanently removed from my firms recommended hotels.",1,1
"When I first arrived, I was greeted by a young doorman who talked for the next five minutes about how tired he was and that no one was tipping him. They told me they validate parking but when I went to the garage, the folks there told me they have no relationship with the hotel, aka no validation. Went up to the eighth floor which smelled like piss. Woke up at 5am because my four year old daughter had to go to the bathroom. When I pulled the covers off her, I noticed THREE insects IN the bed. That is when we decided to check out. My left arm has at least eight ot nine bites from bed bugs and my left forearm is swollen from what appears to be a spiderbite or something. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!",1,1
"I had a horriible experience at Days inn on Upper West Side.  Staff treated us with bad attitude from the beginning. we were forced to check in over 1 hour late despite coming on time and having 2 small children with us (including a 6 month old baby). The room was not ready and the staff was not even apologetic about it.  the Bed we were promised was to be ""Queen size "" but it really wasnt more than a double bed the Elevators were out of order besides only one that worked to go up to the penthouse floor - so it would take up to 30 minutes to go up and down from the floor. The hotel was understaffed. Response time at the hotel throughout the  stay was continuously  delayed   the free Internet offer was pretty much irrelevant since the interenet did not work in the room.   The",1,1
"Worst internet service I have had in 10 years. Staff refused to do anything about no wireless internet connection on several whole floors. Wireless connection worked only sometimes and slowly in lobby. Two of 4 elevators out of service for a year and a half, according to long-term residents -- so waiting for one takes forever on weekends. Plumbing issues with sinks and tubs incredibly slow to drain and a toilet that took 20 minutes to stop running very loudly.Limited cable service with very few TV channels to choose from.",1,1
"This place is kind of a dump, especially for the price. There were three channels on the tv, the phone didn't work and I could not get a signal on my phone cell phone. All the furniture was beat up and the walls were peeling. The only heat consists of a radiator from the 1920's that smells and makes noise when turned on. The is no way to regulate the temperature of the shower despite attempts to adjust the hot and cold knobs. The towels are basically card stock. I booked directly through the property and paid an exorbitant rate only to be place in one of the worst rooms.",2,1
The net curtains were filthy ~ carpet heavily stained ~ it really was dreadful ~ not as the website!!!  Weirdly though bed linen & towels clean ... Corridors ~ standard of cleaning very poor & only 2 small lifts.  We did request another blanket ~ never arrived ~ we were also told we could be upgraded at a cost!! If something is NOT as advertised does that not contravene trading standards?,2,1
"We chose this hotel,solely because of the location;only to discover it was absolutely horrible.One of the main reasons was the dishonesty of the hotel staff.We booked a non smoking room,only to discover it was fully booked.The staff told us we should upgrade the room in order to get a non smoking one.They showed us what a smoking room looked like (Absolutely horrible room,with terrible smell) and what a 50 dollar upgrade looked like (on the 11th floor.Only floor that was remodeled).We later discovered that there were plenty of non smoking rooms in the hotel,which means they basically conned us into paying 50$ for a upgrade.  We decided to look for another hotel online only to discover the wifi broke down.We called reception (which put us on hold for 10 minutes),and they told us",1,1
"This hotel was an ugly surprise! Everything positive about this hotel is outside its building: Location, restaurants, shopping. Housekeeping staff, friendly and efficient,and that's it. We had just two channels to watch on the room tv.I told the lobby staff about and they didn't care about it,zero reponse!! And the worst of it: when we checked out, we were literally harrassed by an african american security guard from the hotel, very agressive, pushy and abussive, ungentle!!! He totally disregarded the fact that I was travelling with my mother, an elder woman.She got really scared and nervous by the threatening attitude of this caveman!!! Some personnel is out of control!!! There is no one to report this outrageous behavior to.",2,1
"The hotel, a relic from an earlier age, needs to be retrofitted for the 21st century.  It has only two ancient elevators that are very slow.  There was no tv control on our arrival in our room.  It should not be necessary to slam the door to your room as we had to during our stay.  The hotel's location on the Upper Westside is its most positive point.",1,1
"I needed a hotel close to the start of the NYC Triathlon - and this Hotel had the best location.  Not only was it a 10 minute walk to the starting area - but a great location for restaurants and access to Centra Park ( a bit of a walk but safe).  Upon check-in, you will want to part on 95th PRIOR to check-in.  There is no area to park your car and unload.  Upon check-in we noticed the hotel elevators were out of commission - and only one set was working.  Our room was dark and the key NEVER worked.  Without boring you with the explicit details of our experience - let's just say this hotel is in desperate need of a makeover.  The hotel staff is really what  balanced our stay - very courteous and genuinely concerned about all the issues we encountered during our stay.   If you",2,1
"We stayed at this hotel in September 2013 and it wasn't too bad, so when we decided to return to New York for a further short break we booked it again as it was certainly one of the less expensive hotels that we found through an internet search.   The good points last year, and once again this year, were the very close proximity to a Subway station, the excellent Manhattan Diner which is just a similarly short walk away around the corner, and the fact that Central Park is only about a 10 – 15 minute walk away.  Now for some items from the depressingly long list of negatives –    Unfortunately the train we were travelling on to New York (from Boston) broke down and it took 3 and a half hours to get the problem fixed. Therefore we were much later in arriving at the hotel than",1,1
"Why did we choose this hotel? The location was great , the price good and we had used Days Inn previously. As soon as we arrived, I knew we were in trouble! The lobby looked dingy. One elevator was marked ""out of order""and the one we used was small and musty. We discovered later a third elevator was broken. Neither was repaired after 3 days. The wait for the one small, working  elevator could be 15 minutes!  I won't continue my rant, but I'm through with Days Inn!",1,1
"TV cable down entire weekend; room phone didn't work; bathtub unusable w/ orange, rubberized  glop stuck on bottom; mattress rolled me to the middle of bed. No vending or ice machines. Had requested early check-in 4 months in advance. Didn't get in even 1 minute early.  Worst hotel I've ever stayed at - w/ exception of 1 hellhole in Antigua, which I immediately walked out of. Didn't have that option on this trip.  I've stayed at better places in 3rd world countries.  Shame on you, Days Inn.  As a solo traveler, I don't require any luxuries, but this place did not have the most basic amenities, you know, like a useable bathtub, and a room phone which works in case of emergencies. In old fasioned map-making terms, ""Here Be Dragons.""",1,1
"Good location.  Red Line 1 subway station across the street.  But hotel is under exterior renovation.  Scaffolding covers entire building. Twelve story hotel.  Of the four tiny elevators, only one, sometimes two, were operational.  Other two were completely shut down.  Wait time on 6th floor for elevator often took 20 minutes.  Room was tiny with single double bed with mattress that folded in the middle.  Had to have toilet plunged upon arrival and again in 12 hours.  No parking at the hotel.  Advised that there were 24/7 parking lots near by.  Both were full at 4pm on Saturday.  No place to park unless you could find a spot on a near by street.  One lot a half block away, while full, wanted $44 a night for one entry and exit. All for a reduced price of $172 a night.  Will I",2,1
"No wifi at all for most if my stay, elevator was so horrendously slow, usually wait anywhere from 5-10 min, also got woken up by the phone at 4am because they thought I needed a shuttle to the airport???? Seriously, the only good thing is that the bed was clean and that the hotel was in a good location.",2,1
"Had its days would be a better name for this off off on and off Broadway resting place. It's long past its prime and in dire need of a makeover or just looking like it's run by someone who gives a wotsit. Tired decor, failing services (two out of four lifts and the wifi were broken on my one night's stay) and indifferent staff made it all a bit trying. An American couple in the lobby when I was checking out we're expressing their irritation at the lack of basics and demanding to be refunded. Being British I just put up with it and committed to posting a passive-aggressive review on Facebook afterwards (I'm a man of my word).   It looks like it once had something (see for instance the ornate bookcase/fireplace in reception, and there's a certain faded charm to the odd mix of",2,1

"Terrible terrible place. Door locks don't work so every time you want to re enter your room you call for assistance! People are completely indifferent to your discomfort. Our bath was clogged up! The person who came to fix it used the hotel towels to dry the place and left the towels in our room. When asked, said the house keeping folks will come at some point to clear it!! The rooms were not cleaned properly when we checked in. There was waste from previous guests still in the room! We were told there was parking for a $ 35 charge. On reaching we were told to go find our own! On asking where we could find one, we got almost no help!! Th wifi is extremely weak and erratic.  So why would someone stay here? For the location? At such a price?!!  Strongly suggest look for somewhere",1,1
"Good gosh... Where do I begin?!?!  ""Parking Available"" in advertised in this hotel's on-line description, but it is not an actual amenity of the hotel.  The front desk referred us down the road to the Hertz Parking Lot on Broadway & 95th only to be told by the most rudest and condescending of parking attendees that the lot is full; and then be told by the hotel's front desk staff when we came back to the hotel that we have to find (AND PAY) for our own parking since the Hertz Lot is full!  Also, the hotel NEEDS to fix the elevators.  The paying guests of this hotel should not have to line up 10 people deep like cattle just to take the only working elevator to get up to our rooms.

"My husband and I were getting married May 31st, and upon booking they NEVER told us the TV's were all out, and granted we booked online, however I have worked for hotels for 10yrs, and even when our POOL wasn't working we took it upon ourselves to call guests ahead of time to let them know!  Then we got put in a room seriously the size of a CLOSET!  On a good note, my husband told the front desk we were getting married, and the girl upgraded us to a better room, crappy view lol But it was better than the last room. For a hotel to look like it did in such a beautiful place such as New York, the owners really need to get their act together and make this place priceless!",1,1
"My previous review stated this is one of the best places to stay in NYC, but upon my second stay I now understand that there is a significant difference between the rooms that have been renovated and the rooms that have not been renovated.  My most recent stay was in a room that had not been renovated, and I was very disappointed in how dilapidated the room was after talking it up to the rest of my traveling party who were rightly skeptical at my reservation.  Unless you can ensure a renovated room, this hotel is not even close to being worth the money!  I must also warn you the elevator is scarier to ride in than most, and if the front desk employees engage in a conversation, you can be assured they will not assist you until their discussion is complete, no matter how hard you",2,1
The front desk staff were courteous but you had to wait 25 minutes for an elevator or you could use the E bank of elevators which had a pronounced bounce everytime it stopped making me violently ill with motion sickness. The 9th floor stank of damp and the signage to the rooms is terrible. The key did not work reliably. The room itself had no running hot water for 2 days with no explanation and no compensation. The water that came out was cold and the shower mixer tap had no signage on it as to which way to turn for hot and cold- potential scalding! The air-conditioner was so loud that it could not be run during the night.The wifi did not work in my room- could only access it in the corridors. After 2 terrible nights I left to find other accomodation in New York City.,1,1
We are staying in This hotel is terrible ! When se arrived to our floor it stinked. The key Didnt worked there was no light in the closet where is the Safe box. Ps. The Safe box didnt work.After the first night we found 4 cockroach in our Room .. We informed this in the main desk and they respond that in all ny are cockroach sill they gave us another Room with the same characteristics except that it seems there are no cockroach and the safe box is working...Well the bellmans aré really gentle ... Good luck if you are staying in this hotel,1,1
I can't believe my trip advisor family would even write anything good about this place rooms are like a closet stinky smelly everywhere the carpets got holes I would have took pictures but to hot in halls the elevators are super small should only fit 4 adults hospitality zero and what gym they should take that stuff off the site wow what a dump only stayed one night to horrible to bare,1,1
"Would not recommend. Apart from the nice location on the upper west side I cannot think of any positives about this hotel. As you will read in the other comments - old, outdated, not overly clean. Lifts are ridiculously slow and dingy. TV didn't work at all. And staff in general were not friendly (a staff member  who delivered a mini fridge to the room so I could store my insulin was positively rude as we didn't hear him knocking on the door straight away. Just to note I requested said fridge prior to check in, again while checking in, yet still had to phone and request again after checking in. Just an example of the hotel's efficiency)  For the price you can find better. Would suggest you only stay here if you really can't find anything  else.",2,1
"the rooms of this hotel are very far from what the website describes. I was there with 2 collegues of mine and our rooms were old, the wallpaper was torn in several places and the bath was dirty. Air condition system was very noisy and the nights were terribly hot, but due to the noise it was not nice to sleep with the air condition system on. although all of this people working there were very nice and helpful.",1,1
"I stayed a couple of nights in this hotel. It is a huge and ugly hotel, located close to a metro station, something which is very convenient. My room was in the eight floor and was not easy to find. I had to go through an emergency exit (in which somebody had written the room numbers behind with a marker) to get to it. It did not look like the pictures (I guess they have some renovated rooms, it was not the case for mine). The room had one big window with a busted dirty air conditioning machine on it, a big bed, a table, a huge piece of furniture with a very old big TV on it, a random closet and a bathroom. All of this in a really small space. The window was there but could have not been with not much difference, every noise 8 floors down could be heard up with no problem at",2,1
"Great location, specially if you wants to stay in the west side, 96th subway station is literally just on the corner.  Besides that, hotel facilities are pretty old and the rooms in a quite bad conditions. Elevators mal-functioning, dirty appearance in the lobby, mattress had a kind of low area.   Team seems to be understaffed as well, specially Front Office.  Suggest you look for something else if you have time to look to search!

They are not hoteliers, rooms available, make people wait in lobby until 3 insulting our intelligence making excuses, ruined one entire day because had to rip out (literally banging on shelf) to put in new one, could not use safe, elevators so small constant wait, smelly halls, they think because they put new furniture and carpet on top of old plumbing it makes it better, it does not, they have no clue about customer service and you do not get your money’s worth even though it is in Manhattan.",1,1
"I chose the hotel for location and price.The room was very small and beds are regular size, not queen  and thus not long enough for my 5'11"" frame.  Cable TV was out 5 of 6 days but management did compensate me at checkout.  Room was dark , carpet old, dirty,& probably moldy.   Bathroom floor could stand a good scrubbing.Bath mats were only available ""on request"". Front desk staff were friendly and responsive to problems other than Cable. A gentleman we met on the elevator said cable had been out for most of 4 months he had been staying there.  Positives were proximity to subway , restaurants, deli on corner & family on UWS .  Room was very quiet for NYC.  Elevators still weren't working (see earlier reviews) and erratic .  Only ice machine was on 11th floor and no vending",2,1

Called the front desk, they said the cable was being worked on.  How long has the cable been out??  Wifi barely worked.  The outside of hotel had scaffolding all around it, which looked like construction was going on.  Not too happy with my stay.",2,1
"This is not so much a hotel as it is an elaborate scam to lure money from clueless tourists. Plumbing was a disaster, wifi useless, tv not working. Complaints are recieved with standard polite remarks, but are not  dealt with. What is really scary, is that the same issues that appear in most reviews here are not fixed, and seem to be permanent - hence my growing suspicion that this is a business based on screwing costumers and hotel inspectors over. Would never, ever return.",1,1
"This experience was not a good one.  The service was average. The hotel leading towards our room smelled musty and mouldy. Our room was dark and well outdated. A queen bed only had three pillows, so we had to ask for an additional one. We were most disappointed to get into bed on the first night to discover instead of a quilt we had a thin blanket.  One night we were in bed, it was about 11pm and out of nowhere a male housekeeper was outside our door looking into a cupboard yelling and swearing about having walked up 6 flights of stairs to only find one sheet. I'll leave out some of the choice phrases he used, but he then proceeded to slam the cupboard door, and every other door he used to leave the floor. It was lucky we were both awake, otherwise he would have no doubt woke us",1,1
"What a trip this has been. We're only on day 2 and I can't think of anything else that could possibly go wrong. When we arrived, the room was barely big enough to accommodate the 3 of us. One of the women in my room is 5'6"" and could turn the TV on with her toes by just laying on her bed. The bathroom conditions were abhorrent. Mold on the ceiling, the bath tub looks like it hasn't been touched in days. The most disturbing thing is the crawlspaces in the bathroom-- I have no idea what they're doing there but any guest can open the makeshift door (thing) and there's this empty chute filled with plaster and dead bugs. It's disgusting. We requested a room move. The excuse from the front desk was ""Well, my housekeeper told me that room was sellable"" The LAST thing an unhappy guest",1,1
"Want to relax after running around the city, no tv. The cable system has been out for months. No way to amuse the kids. Long elevator waits. Small lobby rest area.

"If you have booked here to stay or are going to book to stay here, then cancel/look elsewhere! The only good thing about this place is how close it is to the subway (to get around). The rooms are terrible, tv reception doesn't work (I know your not there to watch tv, but it's good to watch to fall asleep) the service is horrible. Air con keeps you up all night. Elevators are the most painful part. So slow. Often waited 10+mins to go up 6 floors!!  My partner and I have stayed here near on 2 weeks. I asked if the day we leave if we could stay an extra 2 hours past check out. The reception lady said no because we will charge you a full night. I totally understand that at some times it is impossible. But we stayed here for 2 weeks! And was only asking for another 2 hours.",2,1
"Reception ladies were unhelpful and rude, tv didn't work, phone didn't work, noisy, bad view from my room. Elevators are painfully slow, air com very loud, keep me awake. room got cleaned, didn't get towels, had to ask 3 times to get towels. Close to subway.  Wouldn't stay here again.",2,1
"Has anyone come to suspect that this hotel does not even have wifi or cable? I am chagrined to admit that I stayed at this hotel 3 times last year (because of the location), and the cable has always been ""out."" There is never any explanation for this, other than, ""It's out all over the city."" Some people have asked, ""who goes to NYC to watch television, and I say, ""I do!"" I am in a post-graduate training program which requires that I travel to the city monthly. I am dead tired at the end of the day, and would love to just chill & watch some tv. I guess i would prefer that they just admit/advertise that they don't have cable & wifi, you know? Otherwise, I would like to try to focus on the positives - the beds are very comfortable, the rooms are a decent size, and the bathrooms",2,1
I can see now why there are mixed review s. Originally I stayed on the executive level.   I had paid for a regular.  That was pleasant.  The tv and wifi wasn't working. But at least everything seemed cleaned and comfortable and what I would expect of a 3 star hotel.  But then they moved my room which is basically any room below the 12th floor.  My bed is a double when they say it's a queen.  The wallpaper is molded and coming off.  My bed sheets barely fit and are ripped. The carpet smells like smoke even though apparently this is non smoking.  And the air conditioning takes up the whole window which makes this room seem even smaller.  Plus the wifi and tv are STILl not working.  Thank goodness I'm out of here tomorrow.  It cannot come soon enough. The thing is if the concierge,2,1

The beds stinks so badly and the bedsheets are never ever been changed. The bathroom stinks like its never ever been cleaned. The curtains are full of dirt and dusk. I booked it and paid for 3 nights in advance, and i checked out in total 20 Mins. i had to book another hotel as soon i saw the room and my whole prepaid booking for this hotel got wasted. Please please please dont book this hotel, total waste of money and time.",1,1
"Our stay was awful. We reserved by phone and asked specifically about onsite parking. We were told the hotel had parking onsite and they quoted a price per day. This was a major factor in our deciding to stay here.  When we arrived, we found that the ""on site parking"" was actually a Hertz parking garage a block away and we had to carry our luggage. The front desk had one person on despite long lines and several employees behind the desk laughing and chatting.  Our TV didn't work, even after maintenance came. The wifi never worked.  The tub wouldn't drain, which made my shower a delight.  The front desk tried to bill me at $40 more a night than my confirmation email quoted. The elevators were tiny - 4-5 people at a time - and so the wait was VERY long. We will not return.",1,1
"We were trying to save money by booking a more pocket-friendly hotel that was also near the subway and various dining options. The location was great, but for the amount we paid, the accommodations were terrible. We were not expecting a 4-star hotel, but for over $400, we were expecting a bit more from the Days Inn. When we arrived, we were told that we had been ""upgraded"" to a queen bed suite; however, the bed was almost the size of a dorm room bed. When we asked for another blanket (because there was only a sheet), we had to wait for three (3) hours with repeated requests. The bathroom was clean, however, you could not get to the sink without turning sideways. Wi-Fi did not work at all despite it being free, and the cable was out during our entire stay. Furthermore, the TV",1,1
"The whole experience was terrible. We had to wait for our room to be readied from some obscure reason. In the meantime the person at the desk coldly deflected any questions or comments regarding services that customers entering the hotel had. A lady complained about the internet because it had been out for the past two days and the guy answered: ""Keep in mind that there are two networks: one in the rooms upstairs and one in the lobby. You can come down here to use your computer."" TV was not working either, heater was super noisy, room had no view, was dark and old. If you like expensive motel, go there.",1,1
"Cockroaches in the bedroom, the bathroom door didn't lock (not good when you have kids!) and then we came to find that someone had removed all our bedding and not replaced it! When we complained, house keeping just handed us the sheets and did not make up the bed! Hot tap gave cold water and vice versa. This is not a $50/night motel so I was very disappointed by the service as it was expensive.",1,1
"First off, all the basics were there - the bed was comfortable, we had plenty of hot water and the room was cleaned every day.  Free wifi also a bonus. However, this was not a great hotel.  If you are used to very basic hostel-type accommodation then this would be fine.  The hotel is very tired looking and the layout is strange.  The lifts didn't feel safe.  The bed itself wasn't 100% clean and the TV doesn't work.   If the place was given a thorough facelift then I am sure it would be fine.  Didn't affect our holiday which was great!",2,1
"The stay was not a pleasurable experience. The window was broken in the first room were in and we had to get a maintenance guy to our room multiple times to open up the window with a crowbar. Also the steam heater made a loud horrendous sound like a women screaming. After threatening to leave the hotel, they switched me to a different room. The Cable t.v. was broken too. Also I believe this hotel did not apply my rapid rewards points from southwest to my stay. Im still looking investigating that.",2,1
"Okay. I stayed here for 10 days. Other than the friendly staff and good location im listing the negatives. None are exaggerated.  1. The rooms are old. Heating doesnt work you need to rely on a portable hotel heater. 2. Hot water is seldom available 3. Bath tub drainage is awful 4. Tv doesnt work at all 5. Internet is very slow and is not secured. Dont do banking on this connection. 6. Target for scammers who call you at night posing as hotel staff and ask for your credit card number. When reported to the reception an excuse is even found for this; ""they tap into our system"" 7. Noisy and too touristic. 8. Elevators are awful. The older ones are so jerky you dont have to go to cony island for a thrill ride. 9. Do NOT stay at any other level than the club level as you will regret",1,1
"Stayed here because had an emergency,not vacation. The place is in a good area but can't find parking, not friendly at all like they are doing you a favor. The ice NOT available in each had to take stairs three floors down elevator went to lobby first then you can go the floor were I've is available then your floor what a pain. The rooms are outdated, the sink was not working, bugs crawling on the walls,the wall paper was staple to the wall, when taking a shower don't take it too long you may drowned, the phones are not plug in and not working not safe at all just in case an emergency, white powder on the floor agains the wall look like boric acid for coaches, mold in the tubs on tiles and no breakfast. Thank god across the street was nice bagel shop for breakfast :(  No bueno",1,1
"The elevators are horrible and probably have not been checked in 5+ years.  The lobby is very sketchy and the hallways are disgusting.  The rooms were pretty clean but overall it did not feel like a safe environment.  The front desk NEVER had enough help as there was always 1 person there.    Also, when we walked into the lobby one night 2 college-aged boys were telling the front desk they had opened their door to their room and found an old man asleep in their bed.  The police were called and dealt with it, but it was still very frightening.  Overall, not safe, unclean, and extremely outdated.  Honestly pay the extra cost and stay at the Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn.",2,1
There is no free/frequent shuttle bus to the airport. Taxi of hotel is terrible; expensive and even took me to the wrong terminal. No one is responsible at front desk when you call them. No restaurant in the hotel. The elevator was bad,1,1
On arriving after a long haul flight from Ireland we were given 2 tiny rooms with 2 double beds there is 6 in our party. This includes 2 adults and 2 teenagers. The staff need cutomer service skills and they simply didn't get what the problem was. We were moved the following night 2 2 larger rooms with 2 double beds in each. In 1 of the rooms roasting hot steam was bellowing from the radiator.  The maintaince enginer informed us this is normal?? My husband has been with a large burn & blister on his hand which he got trying 2 turn the air conditioning off as it was extremely nosiey. Clearly not child or family friendly or safe if they have hot steam bellowing from the radiators. I will be demanding a full refund for the 1st night as I didn't receive what I paid for and I'm not,1,1
"Unbelievably horrible hotel. The worst experience I have ever had with a hotel. They show lovely rooms on the website and when you get your room its 100 years old and stinky as hell! To get to a semi decent room they asked me for an upgrade fee which i refused to pay, So they gave me another room that was 30% decent but smelled like ammonia… I spent 1 hour just getting a 50% decent room, which was far from great. TV doesn't work. I highly recommend you don't come near this hotel ever. worst of the worst...",1,1
"The staff are very friendly and try to be accomodating however I am sure they are challenged daily because there is alot wrong with the hotel in general, jarring elevators, no wifi or cable, the room is shabby and the housekeeping leaves alot to be desired.  As a native New Yorker I can tell you there is alot going on in this hotel that has less to do with business but more to do with pleasure.  I was unhappy with my room and received a full refund.",1,1
"I have reserved a standard room for 2 people and I was very surprised when I found out where my room was. The room was located outside the corridor, in the exit stairs location.  It was very small and you could sniff the smell of cigarette (as someone just smoke in the room). The air conditioner was shaking and in the shower there was a puddle of water. The bed was broken and different pieces of carpet were hand -sewn. After complaining and asking for a bigger room (we couldn't even fit the 2 luggage) the guy at the desk told me ""this is what you paid for ... for an upgrade of 30 dollars per day I can give you a bigger room"" I accepted and they gave me a room in the upper floors and that was much better.",2,1
"This past weekend, we traveled to New York City with our 80 year old aunt and 86 year old uncle for a family celebration.  At 6 a.m. on Monday morning, Auntie realized that someone had come into their room as they slept and stolen all of their cash, a debit card, a couple of checks and a credit card.  However, the robbers were kind enough not to steal their driver's license, which would have prevented us from being able to fly home! (Our room was two floors down.)  Auntie called the front desk and was told the manager wouldn't be in that day, but would be informed later. Also, Auntie was told that it was up to her whether to call the police. They expressed no interest in Auntie and Uncle's safety and well-being or concern in determining whether other guests had been robbed.  The",1,1
The tv wasn't working altough we had payed for a tv and the wifi was barely working either. The heater made a lot of high (really really high) noices during the night and the temp couldn't be controlled from the room so it was either freezing or deadly hot. The shower head was about to fall out of the wall. No refrigerator. Overall the hotel was dirty. Would never ever stay at this place again. Although so is the location ok.,1,1
"We very recently stayed in the hotel from the 10th to the 16th of February, we checked out, and left our luggage in the hold behind the reception desk, during the time our luggage was in the hold a pair of $250 headphones were stolen, after arriving home, I rang the hotel twice, enquiring about the headphones, the woman I spoke to said ""well they must have been stolen so there's nothing we can do about it"" and the second time, I asked to speak to the manager and she said ""I have already told you, we can't do anything about it, we don't steal, we don't do that here.""  I am currently waiting to call again to speak to the manager due to the fact I was told she would be back ""in a while."" Although being entirely unhelpful or sympathetic to the situation, she was completely",1,1
"This hotel is very well situated, the staff are very friendly and the price is ok for New York. Some basic things didn't work when we were there though. These included hot water, Wi-Fi and the TV. The rooms are quite clean, if a little dingy, the furniture chipped and old looking, like it was rescued from a thrift shop and the bed is a bit soft. The heating system hisses loudly, which the staff explained, is normal in New York. In short, good for a cheap one-nighter, but not longer.",2,1
"We paid in advance and were told ""no refunds"" or we would have relocated. The lower rate we paid ($125 night) was not worth the uncomfortable surroundings. Our bed sheets were too small & popped off when anyone came near the bed. We tied a washcloth around a pipe to soften the noise from the ""radiator"" so that we could attempt to sleep. The bathroom was gross with a ceiling covered in mold, (I took pictures) a hole in the wall, cracked wall tile, and broken toliet paper holder (the paper roll was placed on the edge of the bath tub.) We did not receive maid service until we requested it and were given two small bath towels, one of which had a unmissable mat of hair clumped in the center. We asked for extra towels and were given ONE extra. There was an ancient small television",1,1
"I stayed here for 5 nights. Friendly staff and decent location, but I'm afraid that's where the positives end. In a party of 24, we had booked to all be on the same floor. However, when we arrived we found that we were spread out all over the hotel. The rooms were very noisy, from outside and other rooms (walls seemed to be very thin), the lifts took forever to reach their assigned floors, and the door to our room had clearly been jimmied open numerous times as there were deep dents in the side of the door and the frame on the side where the handle is. It was also apparent that outsiders could come in off the street, as there was numerous female 'visitors' on their way down from the higher floors almost every time we went in the lift.",2,1
"I arrived at this hotel and it looks already very old and worn. The same was for the rooms and as soon as i discovered that there was no wifi in the rooms(Which on the internet said there would be) i just had to leave. I cancelled my reservation, which thank god was not a problem. And went to central park hotel which was a way better choice.",2,1
"This hotel is like something out of the 1940's. The heating system was like nothing I've ever seen before, when is was on very noisy and had steam coming out of it . Windows and windowsills covered in condensation, room ok, very old and shabby looking ,bed was comfy and bedding was clean , beds made every day and clean towels each day , wi-fi worked,  Lifts were very temperamental , area good, great eating place across from hotel on corner, subway close too,",2,1
Horrendous - no heat at ALL in the room on a night that it was 20 degrees.  Noise from the street was unbearable.  The hotel has long term stays and it seems that people are LIVING there.  I would never stay here again.,1,1
I letterally could not sleep from these awfully loud heaters. They have these old time devices with the sound of a train whistle. And if you shut em off you will freeze in this time of year. I have no idea how people sleep in this hotel. Just buy your piece of mind and opt out for a better hotel.,1,1
"We only stayed there for one night, and spent little time in the room, but the time spent there was not pleasant. The air quality in the room with the window closed was stuffy, and with the window open it was noisy. No blackout shades. Paint in the bathroom was peeling and the toilet kept running. No TV because the cable was down and wifi very slow. In the morning for checkout we waited for the elevators, but all were filled when they got to our floor (4). We ended up walking down the stairs with our luggage to checkout. I asked for a discount for the inconvenience. Still waiting to hear.  I will not stay there again.",2,1
"I have stayed near here before and the location is fantastic so when I saw this hotel online at  such a good price I went for it....man be careful!  The initial room was poor so they changed me to another that was marginally better, all seemd pretty clean (not great though) but the decor is fast approaching end of life, no smoking rooms are optional but in fact all seem pretty smokey, overall not impressed. Was told that they were undergoing a refurb but none of those rooms were available.  No cable TV - in fact NO TV at all and the fitness suite only has 1 running machine and this has been broken for ""some time now"" according to front desk, disappointing. The business suite is a joke - you need credit card just to access the internet and no printing is available - WHAT!  On the",2,1
"Having paid what we would consider good money for a hotel room we were very disappointed in the quality of this place. The decor was tired and a bit scruffy, it smelt funny and our room could only be described as pokey. No TV or wireless internet was available in our room either. The staff were variable. Some were extremely friendly and helpful and others ranged from indifferent to downright surly and incompetent. And let's not talk about the lift! Given a choice I would rather have used the stairs to get to our 8th floor room - it would have been quicker. Two good points: it was reasonably clean and had an excellent location. The subway was just outside the door and the bus stop for the Hop on Hop off bus not more than 50 metres away.",2,1
"Room was double-bed instead of queen, got offered stinky smoking room with queen bed, refused, got 'upgrade' to king bed complete with springs poking out, this was replaced with a queen mattress on the king base!  The cleaner flooded the bathroom, said it was all fixed but it happened again the next time we used the toilet!  There was NO TV service to the whole hotel throughout our stay, the sockets in the bathroom didn't work, the tea/coffee in room were not replenished, the furniture was chipped and the carpet was dirty. The wallpaper was stapled to the wall and the carpets were torn in the corridor. The day we left there was a 'Stop Work' order posted on the front door by NYC ordering all work to cease in the basement due to unsafe working conditions.  The only nice thing I",1,1
"Our family had the unfortunate experience to stay at this Days Inn.  Several problems were present when we checked in.   Due to staffing problems with housekeeping, the room was not available until 2 hours later, around 5:00 pm.   TV reception was not available during the entire week.  According to the front desk, the TV cable provider was not notified of the problem until later in the week.  The device to code the room keys was malfunctioning, so multiple trips to the front desk were required to enter your room.   To get hot water, it was necessary to waste multiple gallons of water before hot water arrived.  The business center had a personal computer that was dead, so printing a return boarding was not possible.   Management informed the front desk staff that they were not",1,1
"Location was great.  Easy access to subway.... hop on off. Nice neighborhood. Room space small. If they did a deep cleaning & minor repairs; it might pass. Elevator broken, only had one to use,  long wait, cramped & tiny. Cable was out. One perk was the availibility to leave our bags with bellman until check-in.  This allowed us to venture out & see the city after our redeye flight. Probably would not recommend to a friend.",2,1
"I came for work and stayed 5 days.  Rooms do not have heaters, the TV didn't work, hallways smell their age, to get to my room I had to go through the emergency exit; my room was actually located right next to the emergency stairs, I heard when people walked up and down the stairs.  I felt like I woke-up the entire floor every time I try to close my room door.  Note: the door was uneven and it wouldn't close unless it was slammed. Reception/ Check in was not courteous.  The maintenance staff warned me to not use the main elevator if I didn't want to get stuck....  The room and bathroom were cleaned. The location is great, it is the least expensive ""normal"" hotel in NYC; although when you come for work all you just look for a great room to rest, which I didn't have.  I wouldn't",2,1
"Not the best hotel I've stayed in. We new that New York was expensive so we had to choose a cheaper hotel.  Beds were VERY comfortable! BUT our sheets on our bed didn't fit, there was no fitted sheet and the sheet didn't go to the end of the bed so our feet were on the bare mattress. The maids didn't ever vacuum cause we left something little on the floor to see if it would get vacuumed up! One day we got 4 towels, a bath mat and a hand towel, another day we got two towels and no bath mat. Bit inconsistent.",2,1
"I previously had given this hotel a somewhat positive review, partly because for whatever reason they always gave us a free upgrade to top floors that have been remodeled and are ok. On our last visit we were offered a $50 upgrade for presumably a nicer room and a fruit basket and few other trinkets and we declined. They put us in Room 1004. My God! The wallpaper was falling off, it smelled, it was truly disgusting. We couldn't wait to get out of there the next morning. We stayed in the past in part because of the rate but if we have to pay another $50 a night to get the top floors, it isn't worth it.",1,1
"This hotel room must have last been redecorated during Prohibition! I could not believe the degradation in this room. It had an overpowering odour of stale, decaying and very old furnishings. I felt I was being punished for past indiscretions in my life by having to sleep in this dump. It was awful and a nightmare! On entering the room, which took time some doing because of the magnetic card malfunctions, I was taken aback by the broken furniture, decaying carpet and the bathroom.....something from a period of long ago. The tiles are cracked like they have been forced apart by a pipe poking through the wall. In all my life and in staying in hotels in third world countries, nothing compared with this utter and absolute disaster  of a hotel room. DO  NOT STAY THERE!!!",1,1
"I was extremely disappointed with your staff during my stay at your hotel. Before I made a reservation I called to enquire if I could leave my luggage overnight and was informed we could.   My family and I were planning to stay in NY from the 18 Aug – 24 Aug, but we were going to Woodbury for a night (on the  21 Aug), thus we wanted to leave some of our luggage at the hotel for one night. Since we were informed we could, we made the booking to stay at your hotel.   When I checked in on the 18 Aug, I confirmed again and asked if I could if I could leave my luggage over night as I was checking out on the  21 Aug and will be returning to stay at Days Inn on the 22 Aug until 24 Aug. The staff at the reception  (Stephan) said no problem.   When I checked out on the morning of 21 Aug,",1,1
"The rate was great! The room was a good size and the bathroom was acceptable. It was very dated, the elevators were very old and very small, the halls had no A/C and smelled and felt like the dryers were vented in to the hall. There were 3 lamps in the room and 1 worked, there were no plugs for phone chargers, they did not replace the coffee supplies after I used them the first day, the internet was free but never worked the 4 days i was there,I only got 2 very small towels, I had personal items thrown away. The hotel didn't care and the customers services absent. The MOD Joel, was the worst I have encountered along with his staff. Don't waste your money.",1,1
"We stayed here for 6 nights, we arrived at 1am and were made to wait 10 - 15 minutes to check in which the reception staff pretended we weren't there. The door man had to go look for her twice before she came out to help us.  We had requested a King Room when we booked, only to find that we had been given a double bed, which the girl at reception insisted was a Queen and the they do not even offer King Rooms to people who had booked through the company we had booked through. Our room key hardly ever worked, which meant we had to run down from the 11th floor two to three times a day to have a new card reissued.   The hotel did not provide a fridge in the room, instead you have to pay $25 to have the privilege.  The only thing going for it was the washing room on the second floor,",2,1
"This was the worst experience ever, we lasted 2 hours.  There was drug use  which the management did not care about, the rooms were extremely dirty, toilet seat broken, dark and dingy.  Staff did not have any manners - customer service did not exist. I was with my son and friend - we did not feel safe. My poor husband spent 2 hours trying to get expedia to transfer us to another hotel, which finally happened,  This place should be shut down. Strongly advise everyone not to book yourselves in.",1,1
"This is the nastiest hotel I have ever stayed in. It is in a wonderful location, but that's all it has going for it. The carpet is awful and the floor beneath it felt spongy. I wouldn't put my bare foot on it. The building was a converted apartment house and I shudder to think anyone ever lived in an apt this small. The furniture was scratched and looked like it had been purchased at a yard sale or thrift store. No comfortable chair to sit on and the desk/make up table had no light! The bathroom was small but at least updated their ""free"" WiFi was pathetic and not working during most of our 2-day stay.",2,1
"I booked from june 27th to june 30 th I was in room 1000, very bad hotel 3 of four elevators broken  waited 20 minutes for elevator lots of complaint from tourist, air conditionning in room over 15 year vold very noisy with crakeling sound ,bathroom dirty  ceiling corner all rusted, TV very bad old  about 6 chanel. Canceled after 2 days and went to  Time Square Hotel much better",1,1
"First off, three of the four elevators for all the 12 floors where not working. This meant that if you were staying at the 11th floor, as i was, you would have to take the stairs. And if you absolutely had to take the elevator, you would have to make a line of about 15 min. The managers weren't in and didn't care, one of the staff members told me: ""we already called the engineers, anyway my shift ends in 30 min so it's not my problem"" A family member of mine was staying in this hotel as well with a large group (about 20 people) and they gave them the worst rooms because of the large number of people eventhough they had made the reservations months ago.  There are cochroches in the rooms.  Terrible room service. The hotel was way too full. They made us wait 5 hours to get our",2,1
"I traveled on wed May 29 to NYC, with the company owner. He had booked this piece of crap on line based on the price and people dishonest reviews. We get there and there is a guy outside (seemed upset and did not even greet us), we checked in and proceeded to go to the rooms. The first rooom was on the 3rd when the door opened you would think you were in a ash tray. Mine was on the 7th floor, first sign super dirty carpet with an inch of dust build up around the carpet. A strange man was rooming the halls which were like a maze and only had room for one person to walk since it was super narrow. I finally found my room and the strange man was still rooming the floor with his head down (very creepy, made me feel very unsafe). The ROOM, was dirty and smelled like smoke. The covers",1,1
"We left our booking late and so probably deserved to get one of the 'dogs' given it was graduation week. On arrival, reception was disinterested. The first room we got on the second floor had a 3/4 bed and a single bedside lamp (looked like a single room). The AC vents were broken. After complaining we were given a larger room on the 10th floor. Positives - great location close to subway, walking distance to Central Park, nice Corner Cafe across the road plus a nearby laundrette. Good internet connection. Helpful tour desk. Negatives - towels were too small, sink plug leaked, toilet cistern handle was loose, desk chair was unstable, carpet was 'sticky', curtains off tracks, slow elevators, wrong size sheets on bed, and absolutely no attempt to help us get a cab or handle our",2,1
"I was traveling with my wife and made the mistake of waiting to find a hotel until the last minute.  We ended up paying $230 for this hotel.  If it was anywhere other than NYC, I would equate it to at <$50 hotel.  You can view the attached photos to see the overall quality of the room.  When we arrived, we were not greeted and waited at least 10 minutes while the one person in front of us was being transferred to another hotel.  We were almost given a smoking room, but then they were able to find a non-smoking room with two doubles.

"By far the worse hotel we have ever been to!!! The heater didnt work, no cable t.v., only an old 12 inch screen, all channels were fuzzy, the comment before us is all lies, the lamp was even broken, cheap old blankets, carpet nasty, elevator nasty, couldnt understand the front desk clerk that barely spoke english, and the phone next to the bed didnt work. Only the phone on the bathroom wall worked. We prepaid for a single queen, and when we got there all they had was a double twin room. When we originally arrived, the front desk clerk and concierge were argueing because the front desk clerk was goofing off in the back, "" you're not my boss"" is all we heard for the first 10 minutes we stood there. This is not a reflection from other Days Inns we have been to. This is the only one",1,1
"This hotel is in an ideal location - can't beat it. unfortunately, it has consistently bad service and puny, grimy accommodations where hot water doesn't work and pressure is low, faulty heating/ac and a front desk staff that could really care less about your comfort or that you've already paid for the room that doesn't have all services working. You get an eye roll and they look behind you at the next person line. My family and I have tried it 3 times in the past few years and each visit gets worse. Reserve at own risk.",1,1
"I stayed at the Days Hotel because i had to be near West 93 St.  The bed was okay but there was no excuse for the state of the bathroom.  Both the bath and the toilet were stuffed up and I had to shower in a foot of dirty water and had a non-working toilet the next day until someone came up in the afternoon to unstuff everything.  The rates were cheap and the amenities were non-existent.  The TV only had a few channels and I couldn't get what they had.  The only amenity offered was soap.  The hotel obviously can't bring in enough business to maintain the hotel at an adequate level.  If you can afford to spend more than $95 for a room in New York, then don't stay at this hotel.",1,1
"Expectations were low for this place knowing the deal with older nyc hotels, we just wanted a clean, comfortable enough place to stay for one night. The front desk staff was friendly and lobby had free wifi. When we walked to our room on the 2nd floor, the stench of fish cooking was overwhelming. It was clear some staff or long-term guests were cooking on the second floor and airing their kitchen fan in the hall ways...I'm not exaggerating..it wreaked. The room was larger than expected, plenty of room for 3 people. There was a cockroach in the sink which isn't shocking for NYC but after the fishy smell and seeing some vom on the carpet...not the most pleasant welcome gift. Phone didn't work to call front desk, or any hotel extensions. Make sure to request a room away from the",2,1
I will never stay in that hotel again!! Hotel Employees are very ruled. The hotel itself is in a good location but the customer service is very poor.The first room the gave me was a olda and run down. Housekeeping was cleaning it and it still looked a hot mess. They don't ever have to worry about getting my business anymore. It the Big guy at the deske h is so ruled. He don't realized if we don't if it was for our money he would have a job there. They have to realized we pay there salary .Front desk needs help especially when there is a rush hour.,2,1
We've booked rooms through Priceline many times and this was by far the worst hotel ever. The room was the size of a ealk in closet. The television did not work. The pictures on priceline did not at all look like our room. The room had a musty oder and needed renovation. The elevators need to be serviced. The office staff were very rude. Overall horrible experience.,1,1
"It is not all redone as advertised nor is breakfast included. Our room was very old..cigarette holes in blanket, broken toilet seat, windows taped and couldn't see thru them. broken blinds.  The one elevated opened and just the shaft was there!!  It was fairly clean and most of the staff were friendly.  The subway and hop on off is steps away.  Not the worst, but there are better.  The 11th floor is redone but didn;t have a room for us.",2,1
This time around was my second time in the same hotel. I noticed the unfriendly nature of the staff especially the front desk. They are not welcoming and obviously discriminating .the front office need to be tidied up,2,1
"I had stayed here solely to keep my frequent stay points with Wyndham.   Otherwise, I would avoid this place.  While it can be seen as a bargain by New York standards, don't expect to be in the heart of what New York is all about.  This property is in the Upper West Side which is very residential; however, you do have the subway station right around the corner here which will take you to midtown in under 15-20 minutes.  The reception clerks that were there seemed to be more interested in catching up on their ""kawfee tawk"" and gossip while I'm standing there waiting to get checked in.  This was not true for all of them though, as the clerk that handled my check-out was pleasant, efficient and friendly.  The hotel itself is old....I mean OLD!!!  The lifts are slow and creaky.

"We have used Priceline for years and never had a problem with hotels.  This hotel was by the far The worse hotel we have ever stayed at.  After having trouble finding the room, after going thru hallway after hallway and having to smell this horrendous odor in the hall we finally found our room.  We opened  the door and couldn`t believe how disgusting this room was.  1st of all, it was the size of a big closet.  The furniture in there was so old that the wood was coming off it.  The rugs were disgustingly dirty and the dust on the carpet was inhabitable. There was no way we were going to spend a night in this disgusting room.  To the hotels credit, we immediately went down to the front desk and yes, they did change our room to a newly renovated king size room.  That room was very",1,1
"This hotel was just horrible. Besides the fact that it needs renovation, the elevators take forever to come, and move very very slow. The rooms were HORRIBLE. There was no cable at all only basic channels ( the news mostly), out of date tube televisions, the bathrooms were mediocre, the AC made a loud disturbing noise though out the night as well as the heater that real across the floor. The bed was OK. The pictures on the hotel site shows beautiful king bed sized rooms... where are they? Also, the entire hallway smelled like cigarettes and other substances.  I do not recommend this hotel to anyone, it was not worth $116 a night.",1,1
The shower curtains big brown stains on it. The bed was not dusted correctly and when my husband and i pulled the sheets back there were crumbs every. The ceilings had cob webs all over . I could never forget room 505. From the outside it looked like it stood up to the standards of the other days inn hotels that I've been too and i was absolutely wrong.,2,1
"My husband, two kids and I stayed here when visiting family in central park west. It was close to both our family and the subway and had many good neighborhood places to eat nearby and seemed reasonably priced...but it was Very Dirty. The halls smelled of mold/smoke and when I took off my shoes and socks in our room I could feel dirt/crumbs on the carpet. Please have housekeeping use a vacuum between each guest, at least! One elevator was always out of commission, and not always the same one. There were only 5 channels on the TV, which is a problem when you want to relax with your kids after a day pounding the pavement. And though the sheets were clean enough there were stains on the bedspreads. The room was hot, in January, and we had to keep the loud AC going all night. I",2,1
"Stayed 6 nights on 3rd floor. Room was tiny, bed was too small for two people, thin blanket. Furniture outdated, carpet looked like it was there since they build the building ages ago. There was wallpapers peeling off here and there. The old water heater was hissing loudly when ON so we had to sleep with earplugs or freeze all night, asked for nice room when checking in, was told ""we're fully booked"" and also that the nicer rooms are more expensive. Corridors smelled bad, like there was kitchen in each room cooking who knows what.... Not even once we were told good morning when going through lobby in morning, unfriendly staff.  To be fair I have to mention that the bathroom was fine, clean, with good shower pressure and the hotel is in great location with subway right around the",2,1

So many strange things happened in this hotel including my phone continually turning itself upside down to how I would place it on the table (I would place it face down and when I would look at it a minute later it was face up again), photos were taken on my phone at 5am in the morning when we woke up around 9am each day...pictures included aura looking shots. Alarm decided to go off randomly when I asked what the time was, as soon as we walked into the bathroom one morning the faucet went on full blast...and the list goes on.

"There are a number of issues with this hotel. When we first got to the hotel room, it smelled terrible and the lights flickered. The hot water was extremely limited on the first night, the hairdryer was broken, and there was a half-eaten granola bar at the snack bar. While they did provide shampoo, there was not any conditioner, and we were not given any washcloths or hand towels. When we asked for some, the housekeepers were very rude and told us that they were all currently in the laundry and would not be ready until 11 pm. When we called the manager to ask for a new hair dryer, he was very curt and hung up on us.   I will not stay at this hotel again, and would not recommend at all.",1,1
This is not an upmarket or middle class hotel! the best thing about this hotel is the staff were friendly thats it!  checking in there where dirty towels in the bathroom and the room standard is extremely low!. thankfully the bedding was clean. bathroom makes you cringe. Was winter and no heating and a cold draft flowed through the window/AC unit. Window was sealed with duct tape. was an emergency booking and thankfully I only had to spend 1 night here.,1,1
"Having booked a room in this motel because of its convenient location  ,  I was really shocked when I arrived  . Stains on carpets , mold , roaches , old furniture,  tiny breakfast room , unfriendly staff , low standard for high rates . But compared to hotels nearby still a bargain .  Stay somewhere else . Spend some bucks more for a better hotel . This place is not worth the money .",1,1
"Staff weren't welcoming. Room confusion and offered no apology simply recharged for the room again without explanation.  Wifi didn't work. Ordered a shuttle to the Airport and it never came. Were left standing outside freezing until they finally ordered taxi's (after being asked numerous times). Powerpoints didn't work. Hot water wasn't constant. Towels were stained.  We had 5 rooms in the hotel, all on different floors.   With all the options that NY has to offer, find somewhere else.",1,1
"I have to say that while the hotel is in a fabulous location close to central park, the Metropolitan and Guggenheim and the neat places in the Upper west Side and Harlem, with lots of cafes and especially a great Bagel place called Tal Bagel, and the subway connections were great, we found the hotel a little rundown and definately our room let in all the considerable noise outside.  In fact, because the air conditioner was put in the window and then tape was used to try and seal the space ( which had disappeared in one section , so the cold night air was blowing in - although the hotel staff did at least put more tape on the next day), we could hear conversations on the street below , as if the window was open. Add to that the fact that there were construction things on the",2,1
"I checked into the hotel knowing that I shouldn't be expecting much. I had gotten a great deal on the standard guest room ($240 for two nights) and already had in mine that it wasn't going to be up to par as other New York City hotels. When I got to the room, I didn't even want to take my shoes off to walk around. The carpet smelled of dank mildew and cigarette smoke. It was highly noticeable that the wood on the entertainment center, cupboards, and desk was chipping off. The shower would flip from being extremely hot to extremely cold at a moments notice. I was missing a remote for my TV, and called downstairs. They sent up a repairman with a broken remote, and within 5 minutes he sat down on my bed while making a personal phone call. So unprofessional. The service was",2,1
"We aren't tourists. We've lived in NY and usually stay with family when we go into the City, but since we had to be at an event on the upper West Side we figured it would be easier to stay in a hotel close by so we picked this place for its location. It's really in need of refurbishing. The lobby isn't very clean, the elevators were kind of scary in that you could look right down into the elevator shaft as you stepped into the elevator. The halls were dirty. The room had very worn out furniture, even an old analogue tv with poor reception. The bathroom walls were peeling. The towels were thin. Although worn out looking, the room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom adequate. I can't believe what we paid for this. It wasn't cheap. Most of the other guests were",2,1
"Positives: - saw NO roaches/other critters and seemed generally cleanish - quiet - large bathroom compared to other hotels  - bed was reasonably comfortable  - location  Dislikes: - severe allergy attack within 5 minutes of every time I entered my room. I went through a pack of Benadryl during my stay. Not sure if it was the dust or some not-visible mold...but as soon as I would leave the room it was fine. - towels reminded me of my nightmares from high school gym class... If your waist is more than 32"", bring your own towel or ask for 2 - air conditioner didn't work very well and was probably part of my allergy problem - pillows lumpy - shower head had been newly installed, but wrongly so...water shot straight up to the ceiling, which was just hilarious but messy. - not",2,1

"This hotel is a joke. no one cares if you're happy or comfortable. the internet is only available in the lobby and it's super slow. the ceiling in my bathroom had major water damage, carpets are disgusting and the elevators couldn't be slower. the worst part of the stay was again the customer service or lack there of. horrible, will never stay here again!",1,1
"I will not recommend this hotel. The best I can say is that it is located in an interesting neighbourhood close to Central Park and the subway. The rooms are worn down and shaggy with filthy/greasy carpets. Cleaning is mostly OK, but it is hard to tell because everything is so worn down. Some rooms have been renovated recently but even these are sub-standard and seem like they need to be renovated. Beds were small but mattresses OK. Air condition worked. TV was a joke. Security box worked. Bathroom worked OK, although I found the water to be suspiciously luke (with potential for legionnaire's disease). The hotel is generally noisy. The guests seem to be a weird mix of little-knowing tourists, long-term residents and low-lifes. The hotel desk was OK and helped us switch room when",2,1
"Travelling with my wife and 3 children (9-12-14) we chose this hotel because we love the calm that the Upper West Side offers after a day of discovery in NYC and we can't afford to pay to much. So, the price was OK and the location, perfect (on a quiet street, next to a subway station on line 1). The hotel is clean, quiet, but has no atmosphere or any personality. The staff was polite but not friendly at all. The elevator are slow, but they are working well. For those who have back problems, make sure to ask for a firm bed cause ours were so soft that I could barely walk on the 4th and last day of our trip because my back ached too much. So, the stay was OK but I would not return to this hotel just to get this little thing that makes a trip memorable.",2,1

I complained and they told me there was no solution.  I complained to Priceline (where I bought the room) and Days Inn told Priceline that they had told me on check in that they were giving me a room without Wifi, that if I had objected they could have given me a room with Wifi but now it was too late.  Were they telling the truth about the Wifi on check in or to Priceline?  Who knows... but clearly they were lying one of those times.  I called up Priceline and demanded a partial refund.  Days Inn finally agreed to give it, but complained to Priceline that I was being rude and that was the only reason they agreed - so I would leave the",1,1

Should not be a called a hotel. DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY.",1,1

"I arrives at the hotel tired and ready for a hot shower. 45 minutes later I was still waiting in reception trying to work out what had happened with my reservation. The hotel Manager (Mr Hernadez) was not only unhelpful, but was also rude. He did nothing to help the situation, which was extremely frustrating. In the end my work collegue who had booked the room had to come from the other side of New York to confirm the booking. After receiving my room key, I was shouted back to reception to be told they had mixed up the keys and someone had just gone up to my room with the same key. 20 minutes later they said I was able to go up to my room, by this point I was very stressed and annoyed. The receptionist did not even appologise for the delay. Once in my room I realised I only had",1,1
"The location was great, I'll give it that.  Right next to the subway, in a safe neighborhood.  But the hotel itself was very disappointing.  We didn't mind that the room was shabby - after all, it was inexpensive by NYC standards.  But we did mind that: 1) The beds were very uncomfortable and awfully small for Queen Size; 2) WiFi didn't work in the rooms - you had to go down to the lobby and compete with all the other guests for plugs in order to use it; 3) We had to ask 4 times before we succeeded in getting a dead lightbulb replaced; 4) We had to ask repeatedly to get 3 washrags and handtowels for the three of us, getting first just 2, then just 1, then none at all on successive days.  The front desk always sounded like they'd get right on it, no problem, but nothing",2,1
This was my first time coming to NY. I expected a nice hotel room but what we got was a horrible hotel room. When we walked in it smelled funny. The old tv barly has any channels and had poor reception. I tried to take a shower and barly any hot water came out and the tub started filling up with water!!! By far the worst hotel I have ever been to!!!!!!!!,1,1
Lobby area is full of people on laptops cause there is no wifi in the rooms.. The corridors on the room levels smell and there was builders smoking while working in floor 7.. I don't believe this hotel is being managed properly and I'm surprised at days hotel putting there name over the door,2,1

I put room in quotes because it was more like a closet - small even for NYC. The room was moldy, dirty and everything was broken. Please, please, please do not stay at this hotel!!! SHAME ON YOU DAYS INN!!! This hotel gives other Days Inns whose management and ownership cares about quality a bad name!",1,1
"This hotel is inexpensive and in a good location for those traveling to New York City. This is the best that can be said about this hotel.   If you plan in advance you can find four star hotels for around the same price and they will be well worth it for a few days stay. There are no creature comforts here, no modern amenities. Couple this with weak wireless signals throughout the hotel and you are offline and instep with the dated appearance of the décor (which is noticeably falling apart). If it's too much to improve the décor of the hotel, at least provide the staff with decent suits. Some of the staff is unpleasant, but it could be a result of larger administrative issues here.  Not a bad place by any means, but not so much of a value as to disregard the amenities and",2,1
"Stayed here just yesterday: got in to Manhattan Sunday around 5 and left 24 hours later.  I read reviews on here and prepared for the worst, and was surprised when it started off well: the clerk on duty (Graciella I believe) was kind and welcoming.  The hotel looked pretty nice.  The room was kind of dusty but it's Manhattan, right -- I mean, how much time are you going to spend in your hotel room anyways with only 24 hours in New York?  When we returned after a fun night the trouble began.  We asked for a cot to accomodate an extra friend in the room, and were curtly told ""No -- it's after 11.""  The three people on duty then immediately resumed ignoring us.  We went up to our room and tried to turn the TV on: not only did we spend 15 minutes trying to open the armoire that was",1,1

Since then, every experience has taken a nosedive and I can no longer positively recommend this hotel.  It is STILL a ""value"" for NYC. I won't get into what a ripoff NYC hotels are, and how awful they all are and how much they overcharge. It's terrible, and as much as I like NYC, it is not worth what hotels overcharge. Given that Days Hotel averages about $150 a night, it's considered a ""bargain."" But it's still a craphole. Yup, a craphole.  Since I've been staying there, the wear and tear on the motel is just getting worse. A lot of it has to do with the fact that, because it costs less than most hotels in Manhattan, you get a",2,1

But that is the only good thing I can say about this hotel.  The room was tiny, with paint peeling from the walls; the plumbing worked most of the time, but the heat worked only sporatically (this was in January!). I had made a reservation through the Days Inn web site, and I was offered what I considered to be a reasonable price.  I do realize that one must expect a certain amount of shoddiness in a cheap hotel in New York.  However, when we checked out, they refused to honor the price I had been given when I made the reservation.  So now I have to dispute the higher charge with my credit-card company.",2,1

The hallways though are rough and worn and look really bad.  In the lobby there was this lady sitting in a wheelchair all night with a reddened and swollen knee who looks like she needs her leg amputated, I have no idea if shes a friend or long term resident or what, but it was nasty.  From the looks of some other reviews, they must be rennovating it one bit at a time.  Unfortunately I didn't get a renovated room.",2,1

We found the citizens of New York to be helpful and friendly, so ask for direction and they always help- ( Great for NY) Have a great time and see Lots--Central  Park, the Ice Show is worth seen.",2,1
"Having had to suffer this hotel for my past visit, some of the previous reviews are indeed true. However one thing I will say straight away there was NO EVIDENCE OF bed bugs at all.   The lobby is great, and alas that's where it all ends. It seems that any money spent on the ""renovation"" is only done in the lobby area. The lifts are okay and small, however one of them I was in constantly kept self adjusting its self and took longer than normal to get up to my floor. So I used the stairs. The stairs are tacky and unclean. Complete with tumbleweed on them, I kid you not.  The so called Gym, is just three machines. 1 Bike, 1 treadmill (that wasn't working) and another machine.

We then told reception we were still not happy and we were then given another room to look. At the time this one had not been cleaned and really smelt. We decided to check out but unfortunately we could not get anywhere else to stay so had to go and ask if we could have a room against our wishes.

There are only two elevators in the hotel and you need to wait for at least 5 minutes if you need to go down from the 7th floor. In ""rush hours"" (morning) the record was 8 minutes.

At that point- stay or not?  We ""won"" the room on Priceline but there is a bottom threshold and this sure is no two star hotel. I don't think it even should have one star. The next thing I do it pull up the bedding to look for bedbug evidence. I found none, but what I did see was that the bottom sheet was more than a foot short of the bottom of the bed. Aw gee. Where did they get the deal on too short sheets? Then I looked",2,1
"The only good thing to be said about this hotel is its location.  If you are looking for a hotel in the Upper West Side, then the location is perfect.  Very close to the subway, relatively quiet, just great. Beyond that this hotel has nothing going for it. I paid a total of $333 a night (including all the taxes) for a dingy, shabby very miserable hotel, awful room, terrible service and attitude of front desk staff.  Things promised on the booking confirmation did not exist and there was a ""couldn't care less"" attitude of all staff i encountered. I would never go back there. At that price you can do MUCH better.",2,1
"Summary: Overall, poor customer service, dirty room, tiny rooms, no parking, and expensive price. The one plus is that the location is excellent for commuting around the city. My wife and I were moving to NYC and booked the cheapest place we could using Priceline and ended up with this 1 star hotel. I was pleased since I was familair with the brand (but still surprised at the high price). Anyway, when we arrived parking was a problem. There was no parking on the street and the associated lot ($32) was full so we drove 5 blocks away and paid the same amount and walked back. At check-in I was greeted in the rudest manner ever at any of my hotel stays. The lobby was small but clean and neat.

This made it hard to change and get ready to go sightseeing, but at least they locked our luggage up while we waited. We stayed on the 8th floor in a room that hasn't been updated nor touched up since probably the mid 90's. The paint in the room and in the halls needs redone badly. The blinds were torn up and the carpet was very worn. We decided that for aprox. $150 a night in great location that it would do. We wouldn't do it again. Everything got worse by day 2. The air conditioner barely worked, so it was hot in the room. The coffee maker was broken and the iron didn't work right. The housekeeping came by and took away all of the washcloths and hand",2,1
"First, the good news: it's reasonably safe, in a good location within blocks of Riverside Park, convenient to nice (family-priced) restaurants and subway stops, and it can be had for less than $150/night.   However, it doesn't feel like a ""good hotel""; the elevators are tiny, the hallways are narrow and unventilated, and the rooms are small and outdated. We had a queen size bed that was moderately comfortable, but there was garbage left by a prior guest under a nightstand, and the bedspread was dirty. Still, we did have a nice, tiled bath that seemed to have been recently remodeled.   There are no amenities (short of an in-room closet safe and two granola bars we assume were left by Housekeeping?) and the carpets obviously need a good cleaning. There is free WI-FI, although it's",2,1
Room stunk.  Wifi did not function.  Bed unsleepable.  Window shades in tatters and did not keep out bright light at night (I rigged sheet to cover them).  ONLY hot water in shower--so being scalded was only option.  Taxi driver who took me to airport next day told me he hears similar stories from others who stay in this place.  They offered me 20% off final bill.  They should have charged me nothing or paid me to be there.  Don't be fooled.,1,1
"Very shabby.  Place deserves to be torn down.  For what they get for hotel rooms in NY, you'd think they could renovate the place",1,1
"On a positive note, this hotel is in a great location and just steps away from the subway.  Also, although it is shabby, our room was clean.  But, there are a lot of negatives.  On two of our three nights there, they left us with only one washcloth and one hand towel for two people.  The windows have no sound insulation, so we could here all the street noises.  It is the noisiest hotel room I have ever been in.  There is no central a/c.  Instead, we had a window unit that was very loud and not terribly efficient.  The hotel charges to use the computer in their Business Center.  The television had few channels available, none of which was the Weather Channel or national news.  In all, this Days Inn needs a major renovation.  It truly is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed",2,1
"I stayed here for 3 nights and got the deal off of priceline for basically $150/night.  I was told this is very good value for a hotel in new york, especially last minute.  I would have to say, the hotel location was excellent.  Close to a couple of nice restaurants in the upper west area, nice neighbourhoods, and relatively quiet compared to times square.  Also very close to central park which was nice for walks.   However, other than an average bed and bathroom, don't expect much.  Carpets are old and run down.  Lighting is fair to poor.  The air is a bit on the musty side.  The ad states that internet is included, but access is limited to the entrance in the hotel... you definitely will not have access from your room... Furniture is very old.  Entrance and elevators look",2,1
"The hotel has no parking, they referred me to 2 garages that were full. I had to find a garage on my own 4 blocks away. Most of the staff were typical new york rude, and all of them spoke broken hard to understand english.  Homeless people panhandle  30 feet from the entrance to the hotel. The rooms are EXTREMELY small and they only have one elevator that holds 4 people comfortably. The conceirge is useless and hardly speaks english. The maintenace staff was very good.",1,1
Upon arrival they gave us a room that the bed wasn't big enough for my daughter and I to sleep in and the sheets were dirty and ripped.  TV did not work.  They came up to give us new sheets and expected me to change my own sheets (which should have been clean to begin with).  They changed our room and there were no light bulbs  and the room was filthy. They straightened it up but I still felt that the room couldn't get clean the carpets were stained and sticky.  The staff for the most part did try to work with what they had.  I have stayed in 2 star properties but was glad to leave this one behind.,2,1
"I arrived at the hotel to one of the main elevators not working and my room not ready, which was ok as my plane did land early. once i checked into the hotel my room was down a narrow hallway, entering the room it was smaller then what i booked with 1 queen size bed( i booked for 2) the window was up(31 degrees) and i was unable to put it down, called front desk they sent someone up. i went out to meet friends, upon my return window was still up(24 degrees), contacted front desk and again they said they would send someone up. tried to get onto the internet had no access called front desk(at 10pm) they said, ""we will get our internet guy to rebot"" person knocked on door to let the window down. after 15min tried the internet again still unable to access, called front desk again",1,1
"most of the other poor reviews for this hotel are spot on. In it's defence, the noise level from the street (Broadway) is fairly quite for the location, and the room size is good for NY.  BUT, the hotel is unloved and falling apart. Last renovated in the late 1970s or early 1980s, there are handles missing off furniture, drawers missing,  wall paper peeling, ripped curtains, hair dryers are broken, cupboards full of old telephone directories, out of the four lifts, only one works. We had to keep moving rooms (every night) because of leaks from bathroom ceilings.  The worst part are the long term residents (over half of every floor - just look for the doors with keys instead of cards) who haunt the corridors and boil cabbage in their rooms stinking out the whole building. They",1,1
"I got SCABIES from the bed.    Was itching like crazy after the first night.  I told the front staff about it and they assured me there were no bed bugs.  When I got home, I went to my doctor who prescribed me the appropriate SCABIES medication.    Let me tell you, there is no worthy trade-off for SCABIES.  It doesn't matter if this place is a few bucks cheaper than other hotels, and it doesn't matter where this hotel is located.  When you get SCABIES, nothing else matters.",1,1
"This hotel was outdated and dirty and I would never stay there again.  Here are the bad points:  The hotel must not have been updated for 50 years. There was peeling paint and peeling wallpaper everywhere.  The rugs were old, stained, and disgusting.  The bedspreads were stained.  There was exposed wiring in the elevator.  The room had old windows that let cold air through.  There was a through-the-wall air conditioner that wasn't covered, thus it was very drafty.  There was one heat radiator and guest could not control the heat in their own room.  The water that came through the shower head was often brown in color.  There was no internet in guest rooms.  Internet in lobby was very, very slow.  No clock or alarm clock in room.  Beds were very short.  The elevators were slow.",1,1
"Do not stay at this hotel. It is dirty and overpriced.  Room numbers are etched in or taped on to the doors.   The elevator was sketchy, the phone was broken, no plug in sink. I slept in my clothes. No wifi. You can stay at other hotels nearby that are much nicer like On the Avenue - only $50 more.  Do not stay here.",1,1
"My husband and I went last weekend for my birthday traveling from Chicago. We wanted to save money on a room and have more money to shop/tour. Seemed like a good idea. I was told the Hotel had free Wifi, they never said ONLY IN THE LOBBY. The heat was an OLD radiator you can NOT control your own heat. Infact, it got so cold in my room I had to call for another blanket which is when I was told that it wasn't cold enough to turn on the heat, and when they did it was set to 45 degrees!!! The engineer finally came with a portable heater, which was a life saver! The ""manager"" Rosalynn {who is NOT a manager} told me perhaps I got a sheet {like I don't know the difference between a sheet and a blanket}, and perhaps I could sleep in MORE CLOTHES !!!! My room was small but that part was",1,1
"Where to begin?? This hotel had horrible service. The manager ""Nicole"" was non-existent during our 5 day stay. We were shuffled around rooms, and called liars when we pointed out the things that weren't working. The windows are taped shut with duct tape. The walls had mould and blood, it was horribly creepy. We stayed in winter and the radiator in the room was very noisy, clicking and hissing. Bring earplugs. The hallways were so small my bag kept hitting the walls as I walked.   The only good point is that it's not TOO expensive if you shop around for a deal. also, it's near a subway station which is on the express route so getting downtown is quick and easy.  I would not recommend this hotel and I would not go back. All we wanted was a place to sleep and shower while traveling",1,1
"Let's start with the good. No bedbugs as far as I could tell, and I did check. The bathroom was very clean, as were the linens. Close to the subway, and good restaurants nearby. Also close to a very pretty section of Central Park.  There's a lot to steel yourself for, however. Our room was the smallest I've ever stayed in, which is to be expected for the price and location. Little details are neglected, like the lamps that collapsed upon touching (but they still worked). The maid short-sheeted the bed. The remote control didn't work with the TV (different brands). Peeling paint and corners of wallpaper.  Front desk staff seemed indifferent.  Didn't even try the wi-fi based on earlier reviews, and we didn't get instructions on how to connect anyway.  Honestly, if I were doing it",2,1
"- We were ignored by the staff several times. They were more interested in talking to eacother. At the end we gave up asking them anything. - They didn't want to call a restaurant for making a reservation for us. - Three times the staff laughed at us, they thought we asked stupid questions. - We didn't see a single smile all week. - The door to the room had a big gap all way around, so we could see people walking in the hallway from our bed. - The bed was old and made noises so it was difficult to sleep. - The high speed internet was not high speed, and there were no internett access in the room. - Four elevators, but still we had to wait about 10 min each time we were going to use one of them, and it always stopped in the wrong floor.",1,1
"This hotel is the epitome of  American Greed.  Imagine a dump like this demanding rates of $289.00 for my first night, and yes, $490.00 for my 2nd and 3rd Nights stay. The carpets are so filthy you don't want to even put your feet down, and you are afraid to touch everything else. The Furniture is overused, filthy, and just despicable and they pay absolutely no attention to details beyond swiping your C/C, engaging Usury practices based on the greed of increasing Reservations as they choose to forget that they are RENTING you a room, and unconcerned as to WHAT one is paying for as they prey on the vulnerable traveler.",1,1
"I have been to NYC many times and have stayed at hotels in the city and in jersey. We stayed at this hotel for a girls weekend and it could not have been worse.  After a long train ride, we all wanted to have a shower. As the first one was showering, the water wouldn't drain so we called for maintenance to come up and have a look. He let himself into the room, then told us that he was done his shift in 15 mins so he couldn't snake the drain. We went down to the concierge to complain and they moved us to a new room after 30mins of me trying to convince him that the water wasn't draining. In the second room, there was significant mold (even on the portraits) and red smears on the bathroom wall. After complaining again, we were told that there were no rooms left and they would",1,1
"...because there was an air conditioner.  We have travelled to many cities and stayed in many hotels from cheap to not so cheap but this place was, undeniably, the worst.  Top ten reasons not to stay at this place. 1. bed bugs -- my wife is covered with bites 2. window coverings do not pull across 3. disgusting floors in room 4. elevators make frightening noises 5. had to call for maid service 6. terrible racket at 4am above us 7. 'who cares' attitude from staff 8. funny smell in rooms 9. paint peeling, wallpaper missing, carpet ripped and missing 10. no hot water  I thought I would save some money and see how it went; and it went horribly wrong.",1,1
"I just read a review from another member with a surprisingly similar experience.  My family and I confirmed our two-day reservation with Days Broadway two days before our scheduled arrival.  At that time I was told that the room was fully paid, and I was given information about location and parking.  Upon arrival, I was told that there was no reservation and that the hotel was fully booked for the night - we were left stranded in NYC at 8PM without a place to stay!  Fortunately, we were able to find a tiny room at the nearby Newton for $230 for one night (they were booked up the second night) and then a room at the Alexander for the second night. The employees at Days Broadway were unprofessional, cold, and rude.  Even though the Newton and Alexander are far from ideal, they are",1,1
"we booked through 800-hotels, but called the actual hotel twice to speak with the front desk, once to confirm reservation{made in june} and once to verify that if our plane arrived late checking in would not be a problem. They said both were ok. They lied. We got to NY and at the desk, miriam looked puzzled, said she could not find our reservation, and I showed her our printed confirmation, which was also paid in full. She said she would check with the manager{it turned out that the manager was not even in, some other person in the back was the checker.} They came back after 10 minutes and said that they had had the same problem with several other guests that day-the the 800-hotels people were going out of business and had cancelled our reservations. They gave me a type piece of",1,1
"This hotel is falling apart. If you decide to stay here, despite all the warnings on Trip Advisor--like I did--be prepared to be frustrated. I stayed here because I have been traveling for a while and wanted save a bit, but it really is not worth it. In my room, they had to fix the a/c, the internet, and the safety box before I could use any of them; I could only find one ice machine in the hotel that worked; and at the fitness center, not a single machine worked. Like another reviewer mentioned, the carpet in the room is so dirty that you must wear slippers at all times;  there is no way you can walk on it bare foot. Seriously, this is the kind of place where you expect to see rodents. But worst of all, whenever I'm in the room, I get some allergic reaction: I start sneezing",1,1
all the plumbing was plugged! The tub was calf deep when taking a shower.you could not regulate the water temp and the fixtures were coming out of the wall!! the hotel said they were sold out and would have to rent the room to someone else and could not repair the problem terrible expierence.,1,1
"I booked a short stay at this hotel for myself and a friend since I had to be in NYC to do an interview for a visa. Our trouble started as soon as we booked the trip online. While I wrote my name and e-mail into the form, when the booking went through the confirmation page booked it under my dad's name (since he signed in under his name, I guess). Okay, fine. I'll just call in and change the name on the reservation. You wouldn't believe the run-around I had just to make a simple first-name change. After speaking to different people for 30+ minutes who have NO CLUE and constantly transferred me to other people, someone magically knew how to help me after I started yelling at them.   Fast forward to the week of the stay. I call to warn that the credit card owner will not be",2,1
"I live nearby, and had friends who'd come to visit and had nice things to say about this hotel & their stay.  Booked a room for them in person at their front desk for ~$150/night, two nights, prepaid; the desk clerk understood that my dad was NOT to receive the bill or receipt, this was a gift to him.  My folks arrived, no reservation in my name or in theirs; I had to go over in person with my card to restore the reservation.  The beds were not made, though the bedspreads were fully pulled up and neat, there were no towels in the bathroom.  Phoned down a request for sheets & towels, and for hangers for the closet (there were none), to the desk, and 45 minutes later went down myself to ask for them.  Over an hour after that (past midnight at this point) they showed up and made",1,1
"Was here for 2 night with my folks. The good thing about this place is it is close to Central Park, Times Square, the Empire State etc and plenty of restaurants near by.  But this place is like a pigeon-house. Claustrophobic people keep-off! The pillars on each floor leaves very little space for people to walk along in the corridors. I would think some fat people may not be able to walk freely in the corridors! The rooms weren't spacious either! For 128$/night, I hoped for something better!  Room service didn't show up, they lied to the front desk saying we had a ""do not disturb"" sign out! They couldn't find anyone else to do it and so all I could get was fresh towels and toiletries.  Didn't have a problem with the staff, they were okay. They claimed to have wireless internet,",2,1
"This hotel is being used for housing people who appear to be the equivilant of DHSS boarders. The hotel is very shabby & the staff are very sullen. The whole experience could easily put the average traveller off of returning to this wondeful city. The whole experience was one of feeling that we had been ripped off for a considerable sum of money to stya in a doss house. There wewre kids running in the hallways & doing thjeir homework. The noise was constant day & night fromm the ""fellow guests"". The only saving grace (which is purley coincidental) is the proximity to the subway station. DO NOT GO IF YOU ARE IN ANY WAY EXPECTING ANYTHING BETTER THAN A 1 STAR HOTEL.",1,1
"Stayed with spouse for a few days of sightseeing in NYC.  The hotel was fine enough when we first arrived but soon realized that we should of stayed elsewhere.  The 'non-smoking' room might as well have been smoking since the smell from other room wafted in through the vents, dingy room with a slightly scary carpet (bring flip flops), a stained mattress, and hot water not always available.  If you are there to sleep for a night or two, its fine; but for longer stays I'd recommend paying bit more and staying elsewhere.",1,1
"I have been travelling in hotels in NY and ended up staying here as all other hotels in Manhattan were sold out. One of the worst hotels ever - the room that I got could not be located as there were no signs for the rooms. Finally, I had to go down and the manager told me that the room was located in the staircase area. Terrible, smelly rooms, rickety lifts - they claimed to have free wireless but it was so slow that it was good as useless. No provision for breakfast either - for the money I spent, I would never stay here again.",1,1
My first review on trip advisor.  Just wanted to warn about this hotel.  I was woken up at 4AM with bedbug bites and observed the bedbugs in my bed.  Room was also rather dingy and dirty.  Not a great place to stay.,1,1
"This hotel was a true nigthmare.  We booked this hotel last minute for a graduation and we liked the location.  When we arrived, we checked in and went to our room. The room was dark, dingy, with old nasty carpet and a nasty smell to it.  The mini fridge in the room was broken.   After taking showers to freshen up (the showers had low pressure and not great).  We decided to deal with the room and just enjoy the city.  The location of the hotel was the only thing about this hotel that is a plus.  Right in the Upper West Side at Broadway and right next to the subway.    We arrived  back to our room late at night and got ready for bed.......and this is when the real disaster begins.  The toilet started overflowing and overflowing and overflowing, we could NOT get it to stop, it",1,1
"We stayed in this hotel for one week and it was just awful! There were cockroaches in our room and we were on the 12th floor! The place must have been plagued with the things. I even found one floating in the coffee! The staff were unhelpful and the lifts were awful. Calling it the Quality Hotel is a complete farce. Fawlty Towers would be more apt. It reminded us of some cruddy Youth Hostel in a third world country.  It ruined our visit to New York and we couldn't wait to leave and go home. It is, without any doubt the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I would gladly have paid more to stay in something decent but that will teach me to trust a travel agent, never again! I agree with the person who said take your tent and put it up in Central Park, you'll be much more comfortable!",1,1
"We went there and read their notice about how ""everything works"" when nothing in our room worked..the toliet didn't even flush! so we told the very unhelpful staff who didn't get anything done till the third time we asked them. By then it was our last night and still had many problems with other broken things in the room. In addition they need to sort out their heating systems.. mwhahaha basically dont go there to save yourself from a bad experience.",1,1
"I went to New York as a birthday surprise with my husband and young son.  We were aware that the hotel was advertised as a 2.5 star hotel, and as we had travelled to the US many times before, we knew that although basic, the hotels were generally very well kept.  This one was not - The room was freezing although the 'radiator' was on full.  We had to go to bed almost fully clothed to keep warm.  We stayed the first night as we didn't arrive there until the evening.  Wallpaper was dirty and in some places peeling away from the walls.  The windows were taped up with gaffer tape and in some places where the gaps were too big, there was foam material wedged into the gaps.  The heating made a gushing noise all night, there was steam and water coming from the valve and dripping onto",1,1
"I recently went to this hotel with my husband and two small children. We arrived at 11pm after a longhaul flight only to find the person at the front desk with no manners. We didn't get a lugage cart or anyone for that matter to help bring the suitcases upstairs to our room. The room itself was dark, carpets dirty and to top it off the toilet had pooh in it. I didn't want to walk barefoot on the carpet or sleep in the bed without covering it with the blankets I got from the plane. The only good thing about it was its location for the metro but the transport system is pretty good in New York and I'm sure there are plenty of other hotels near metro stations. The pictures on the hotels website makes it look a lot nicer than in reality, it is old, dirty and in need of major",1,1
"Well lets start off by saying When I arrived at the hotel I was told by the front office mananger My reservations were not found She said call central reservations and get me the reservation # ,By the way she should not be the front office mananger ,she is rude and has no customer service skills , SHe was dressed like she worked at A store jeans and sweater and boots, She is just a unhappy nasty person, Finally after 1 hour going back and forth I got my reservation # and they put it in there system I cant understand if i book at 1800 days inn why would my reservation not be there .

I immediately went to the front desk,,,squished bug in hand, wrapped in a tissue of course......all i was told was sorry there is nothing they can do for me....no refund..NOTHING.....because I had prepaid for the room !!! All the manager on duty gave me was a Days Hotel business card with ""THE"" manager's name on it and was told to call on Monday....I did.. it is now Wednesday I have left several",1,1
"Broken toilet, tv, electrical outlets. Filthy, moldy tub/shower. Dry-rotted drapes, terrible service. The ""Promise"" from Wyndham that they display in their rooms is a joke! Elevators were gross, even had a smashed banana in the door all day. Carpet stained all over, and the corners had a thick layer of dust built up in them. Understanding that renovation is costly, there is still no excuse for FILTH!!! I would not even recommend this place for my dogs. Don't waste your money. The only upside was the location & a wonderful cafe/bakery across the street - the Europan Café.",1,1
"Before leaving for the US, visiting and staying the first time in NYC, my partner and I decided to select this hotel because of the reviews we saw in this site and the its central location. I have consulted twice with my travel agent here, outside the US, before making the reservation. I told him that for certain reasons my partner and I are unable to share a bed although we would like to stay in the same room. The solution was offered also in the hotel homepage site in the form of two beds in a single room. After checking this site and consulting with my travel agent, he rechecked through his reservation center and reassured us that he asked for a twin bed room (i.e. two separate beds) and this is what we will get. Our voucher indicated this. When we got to the hotel after 10pm",2,1
"We  travel to NYC two or three times a year and stayed at various hotels. This time we didn't have as much time to shop around for a bargain hotel and needed to book a room within a day or two of our trip. We used Expedia only because we were having difficulty finding a bargain through our usual travel site. First off, the location offers great access to the MTA, Central Park and all that the Upper West Side has to offer - and that's a lot. The hotel could use a major face lift. Its decor is a mishmash of various styles and looks cluttered and unkempt. Evidently, renovations are under way on some floors. Nonetheless, little attention has been given to where to place a/c units. We had to keep ours off at night because it blew over our faces. That wouldn't have been the case if it",2,1
this place is OK to stay at....the rooms are dated but the hotel is being upgraded...the staff are pleasant and helpful....given this is New York you can expect to pay more than normal for lower grade accommodation...this is somewhere between 2 star and 2.5 star accommodation but price reflects it ....the rate is quite variable from night to night  The pluses were the area generally..this tends to counterbalance the accommodation quality somewhat  Subway about 30 yards from hotel door  ..number 3 line which tracks Broadway through NY  so a very good line to be on Diner about 60 yards around corner on Broadway...food very good for about $7 a head breakfast..full meal Sushi shop directly opposite very good food lots of other shops very close Central Park quite close by...walking,2,1
"Stayed at the Days Hotel in New York july of '07 for a week. The Hotel is very worn, and a bit dirty but the overall experience we had was fine enough.  We had a room with a view over the backyard, not so very nice but hey....someone's gotta have it. Tiny room, and a carpet that smelled horribly but it was cleaned every day, the bed was made and we got clean towels every day. The aircondition made a terrible noice throughout the night, but we were so tired from the experience of the city so we fell asleep anyway. Bathroom was small and old but fine, and everything worked. Overall a nice stay for the price but I don't think I wanna stay here again. It was a bit TOO dirty for me...and the funky smell of the carpets everywhere was too much. Don't miss out on the nice diner round",2,1
"it's a funny thing visiting NYC.  There is an old Turkish saying ""even with all your money, your still shamed"" I think it suffered a little in the translation. Bottom line is this place is a dump. When I and my family visit NYC yearly every Christmas from California we usually stay 10-14 days. As you can imagine 10-14 days in NYC can be brutal on just the hotel expenses. So as such when the midtown hotel prices got to high for us we gave this filthy place a shot.  1 hour after check in we checked out.  And to be honest with you were done with NYC until there is some kind of commitment on the part of the city to clean up their act. Bed bugs, roaches, filthy bedding, high prices? come on. The one thing you expect from a hotel is cleanliness, and when they are as filthy as this one",1,1
"This was honestly the worst Hotel Ever!!!  The only words to descirbe the staff are mean and hateful!!!   I can't even go into all of the many things they did that were appalling...  When I asked to speak to a manager, the receptionist turned around walked to an ajoining room, picked up the phone, and called her boyfriend.....  Needless to say, she had a 30 min. personal conversation!!!  I could not believe this was happening!!!!  Not to mention, there was another hotel guest there asking for a space heater, because the heat had gone out in his room.... and they kept giving him the run around.   I felt so sorry for him!!!  These people were freezing, and they could care less!!!  I have never stayed in a hotel like this...  It is SO BAD, that it seems like it is a practical joke",1,1
I will never stay in this disgusting cesspool of a hotel ever again!!! I am no prima donna but have basic standards of what I expect from hotel acccomodation. Water is one of them. Awoke on second day of stay to find there was no water. Only discovered this after having used the toilet. Disgusting!! Went to front desk and complained. Front desk staff gave bad attitude and lied about not knowing the water was going off. It wasn't hard to catch them out as the three people behind the desk all gave different answers and contradicted each other. I asked to see manager and he only added to the lies as in he promised a refund for the nights accomodation due to no water....guess what...no refund to date. The hotel is very run down. At home we would say the furniture should be left out,1,1
"I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights at the beginning of February, 2008. I was travelling as part of a school group. The first point I will make is that it is very common for school groups to stay here, and naturally good behaviour is not a guarantee - though I'd like to think my group was reasonably behaved! If this is likely to bother you, I strongly recommend looking for somewhere else to stay during your trip.  We had a couple of issues with our room. Firstly, a pressure nozzle in the radiator would occasionally release, leaving steam hissing out for a time quite frequently. Colourfully described by my roommate as sounding like 'two mice having a fry-up', the noise was initially irritating but eventually became white noise. Secondly, the provided hair dryer broke after giving",2,1
"My girlfriend and I have just spent 4 days there. We had booked without checking any rewievs prior to booking. We were concerned due to the mixed rewievs of this place, but decided to take a chance out of necessity. The hotel is old and has seen far better days. The hall ways are confusing, the stair wells and elevators can certainly do with renovations. Our room however was acceptable. It was large, the bath room was in excellent condition and the bed comfortable. We encountered none of the reported bug problems, and our room was cleaned to an acceptable standard. The furniture was old and could need replacing, and the television should certainly have been in better condition with regards to general state and the programmes it could receive. Unfortunately this hotel is in",2,1

The room on the 4th floor had no view but appeared clean (although it did have a heavy ""lemon cleaner"" smell)  with a renovated bathroom.  Pillows looked new, sheets were clean (and changed every day, which made it harder for us to recognize the problem that we had...read on).  Hot water was fine as was the TV.  And it was very quiet (although it was so hot at night that we had to turn on the AC).  Everything seemed okay until the bed bugs struck.  I didn't get bit but my partner was bit all over.  And it was so bad, that he had to go to the doctor when we returned home.  Needless to say, I would not stay there again - which is too bad because",1,1
"Ditto the previous post.My wife and I hunted around to find a decent rate in Manhattan and this ""looked"" good...boy were we wrong.  At check in,the front desk staff were rude and gave us a room.We went up to that floor and looked and all around and could not find the room,finally we opened the door to the stairs and lo and behold...the room was in the stairwell!! The inside was small and extremelly depressing and had a terrible smell.  Also,the hotel was teeming with foreign students..it seems more like a youth hostel than a hotel.  We complained and were given another room that looked halfway decent.we settled in were about to go to sleep.. and saw a big cockroach running across the bed! We were totally disgusted but too tired to leave.  Save your money.",1,1
"We wanted to stay just one night in the hotel, and got a cheap price, but it wasn't worth it. After just two hours in the bed, my husband had eight bed bug bites! The place was totally infested. It's gross. Be careful!",1,1
"Stayed at this Hotel December 8th till the 12th. Convenient location for Subway and walking distance to Central Park. Convenience store on the corner was handy and Star Bucks, Subway in close proximity. Asked and paid for newly renovated room but was far from it. Room outdated and small. Not enough towels supplied for 3 people so had to ask which was supplied. Checkin /check out was done easy. Staff friendly and helpful. Rooms lacked ventilation so in Summer would have to have aircon on to circulate room. Would be a problem if Aircon didn't work.  Generally ok but nothing fantastic. I had hoped for more for my dollar but maybe that is just New York. Would stay hera again if nothing else available.",2,1
"We made reservations at this hotel for the busy Christmas season by calling the Days Inn 800 reservation number. Prior to arriving I called the actual hotel to confirm our reservation and was told that an error had been made. The person at the hotel informed me that the hotel did not allow the specified roll-away for our 10 year old son, and that the room did not allow for three people. I explained that when I made the reservation the person actually called the hotel to make sure a roll-away was available.  The indifferent clerk said she didnt make the reservation and she didn't have any more rooms at our confirmed rate.  We were offered a smoking room for $100 a night more.  After several calls to the so-called Days Inn corporate customer service and several unreturned phone",1,1
"We did and found discarded pamphlets, an empty shampoo bottle, and enough accumulated dust and dirt to convince us that the housekeeping staff hadn't been under there in a while.  There was no deadbolt or other security lock on the room's entrance door, the toilet broke, the television was well worn and received only local and some basic cable channels (no ESPN, for example), the sink and shower both drained slowly, the front desk was curt, one thin towel each for the two of us, to hit just a few highlights.  Maybe borderline acceptable for $75-100 in New York; for the $240 we paid, not even close.",1,1
"We paid 434$ for one nights stay in what can only be described as a shabby hotel. The reception staff were rude and unhelpfull. The room was substandard, even for New York. The airconditioning unit was noisy, making for an uncomfortable night. The only advice I can give is look for somewhere else to stay!!!!",1,1
"It was our first visit to New York and we wanted to stay somewhere close to transit, and not too expensive.  We just planned to sleep there.  I will give it a plus for proximity to Subway, just steps away.  That was the only good thing about it.  First off, they provide discounted parking around the corner at a Hertz rent a car garage.  This place does not have ample parking and attendant told me that they never have sufficient parking for the hotel.  Ended up parking across the street $31/day.  Room was very dingy.  It smelled.  Very cramped.  Poor selection of TV channels.  Couldn't watch Monday night football on TV, not available, in New York I might add.  They advertise free internet, well I got on the second night for a brief time, or else couldn't get on.  Elevators very",1,1
"Do not stay here!!! We booked online for $876 and then they called later to say, we have the dates available, but as its 'shopping week' it will be $1600. We questioned why and the member of staff was very rude on the phone.   We told them to cancel everything and they processed the original transaction the next day. Will be sorted but a massive inconvenience and we hadn't even got there yet!",1,1
"We booked this reservation at the last minute, so I was pleased to be able to get the price at $150 per night on average (not including taxes and everything else they throw in). All the other hotels in New York City were way out of our price range. Funny how a Days Inn hotel anywhere else would be $50 a night! Our flight was delayed on Friday and we spent the night in the airport. I called Expedia and they called the hotel to see if they would refund the money for that night, and they would not - said it was their policy. So Expedia gave us a $100 voucher. The hotel is in a good location - next to subway and off Broadway and a few blocks from Central Park. It is old, wallpaper peeling, stained carpet, small room, but the bathroom was upgraded and it was quiet. The 'fitness",2,1
"Visited NY for my aunts 90th B-day.  They live walking distance from the hotel.  This and the bed were the only positives.  We had two rooms. The first room was in the stairwell. IF YOU MUST STAY HERE, DO NOT STAY IN ROOM 409! The room was small, the wallpaper was torn and there was a hole in the wall.  The room was very small and dirty.  We were able to move to a ""renovated"" room the second night which was much larger.  This room had an armoir that was already warped and broken,  There was a hole in the carpet and the bathmat looked like it was cut out by a 2 year old.  The sink had two ""cold"" knobs.  The doors look and feel like they are only somewhat secure even when locked.  There was an old musty smell throughout the ""hotel"" and it looked like any rif raff off the street",1,1
"Just returned from a trip to NY, staying in this Days Hotel at Broadway/west 94th street. The staff was unpolite (except for the concierge, great guy!!). I booked a room for my son and me, booked for double beds but got a room with one bed double sized. So as soon as I noticed this I phoned the reception and told them that a mistake happened, as I made a pre-paid reservation for a room with two beds. We're sorry this is what you can get, was the reply. And they added: we consider a reservation as a request. Excuse me??!! A pre-paid reservation for a room with two beds, considered as a request? After I got a bit upset and spoke to three (!) people at the phone, while still in the wrong room, they decided to give me a room with two beds. I think my determined attitude made them",2,1
"Be warned, we stayed for three days and came home covered in bites.  Disgusting!  Our doctor said ""bed bugs"".",1,1
"OK firstly, I gotta say for the price we received we weren't expecting a whole lot. And I gotta say the place delivered :) We got a far better hotel right on Time Square for a lot less than this place.   I'll take you through it as we experienced it. As we checked in, the lobby looked presentable and there were a load of ""please forgive our appearance the hotel is being refurbished"". The staff were polite and seemed nice. It kinda suited us as we were tired and just wanted to drop our bags. One of the lads hopped on the lift and it nearly jammed when he stepped in. When the door opened on our floor the halls stank... that was before we even walked into our rooms.    Now the rooms, they were a decent enough size but they looked like they hadn't been cleaned since the place was",1,1
"This hotel is only suitable if you want somewhere to crash. It is in desperate need of a makeover and the carpets smells awful. Surprisingly though, the bed was very comfortable.  As for location, its great, you are in easy reach of everywhere and there is a great deli across the road that do fab sandwhiches and cakes to die for! Overall I wouldn't stay here again, simply as the place has been unloved for such a long time, but if it had a revamp, I wouldn't think twice.",2,1
"The Days Hotel Broadway is an acceptable, no-frills, place with a great location across the street from Symphony Space.  I had no problems with my room, which was shabby but clean with a comfortable bed (but no alarm clock).   The problems were with service.  My business schedule while in New York required me to be out quite late into the evening, so I had hoped to sleep late in the mornings.  Despite the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on my door, I heard the housekeeping staff shouting to each other across the floor around 9am each morning.  This was not simple work conversation, but out-and-out shouting.   The elevator situation is dire.  There seem to be four elevators, although I cannot be sure how many work.  They are incredibly slow and very small (two or three people with luggage",2,1
"It's not very often I agree with all the bad reviews there are for hotels, but this place lives up to them all.  The hall ways are falling apart, the staff are EXTREMELY rude, and the room was in the worst condition I've ever seen.  I've travelled most of the world backpacking, stayed in some low budget hostels and hotels but they have always given me a bed worth sleeping in, but not this hotel. The bed dipped in the middle and the bed clothes were torn.  I can honestly say I was disgusted, never again!",1,1
"We stayed there with a free night from the Cendant best rate program. Upon check-in, they wanted to charge us for the night. We stated that is was a free night and nothing had to be paid. After discussing with the Days Inn Central Reservation agents, they agreed that we don't need to pay for the night.  In the evening, when we came back from a sightseeing tour we found our room's door to be locked. We went to the reception and had to discuss the matter again.   Next day, I had to leave early and my wife did the check-out on her own. Three guys of the staff and one women stayed around here, shouted at her and had her to pay for the night! I would call it sexual harassement. Why could not one single receptionist discuss the matter with her alone? And why did they want to charge",2,1
"We arrived at hotel after very long journey from Aberdeen Scotland, having been ripped off at airport by 'limo' driver at 1am we were looking forward to nice hot bath and clean bed neither of which we got. I have a phobia of cockroaches and was disgusted to see one at the bottom of one of the beds. My friend very bravely crushed it, which was bad enough but on pulling back bed covers was astounded to see bed riddled in cockroaches. Didn't even unpack, was assured by man at reception we would be fully refunded. Got taxi and had to pay unbelievable rates at very clean and tidy Holiday Inn. Anyone going to New York please avoid Days Hotel never seen anything so disgusting",1,1
"The Days Inn is the proud owner of the biggest dump in New York!! i can only reiterate the previous writer's comments and add that we also experienced cockroaches in our room, the most unbelievably discusting stench on floor 2 that was so bad that you had to hold your hand over your nose whilst running from the (dangerous) lift to the room, electric shocks everytime we went to open a door, table lamp litterally snapped in half with exposed wires, hairs in the bath, shower not working, etc etc. I could go on and on. a final word of warning - if you arrange your transport back to the airport through the hotel, prepare to be ripped off. We were given a price to include toll and asked to leave a $10 deposit to be knocked off the fare, only the driver claimed not to know anything",1,1
We actually checked this website before booking this hotel but I can only assume the reasonable reports at the time were written by people on another planet.  The place was filthy.  There is building work going on (which we weren't told about) which just added to the mess. Our room was small and in dire need of decorating just like the rest of the hotel!  The staff were helpful and friendly but that was the ONLY plus point.  Avoid this hotel at all costs!,1,1
"Dear Reader, This hotel was the dumps. When my family of 4 turned the street corner towards the hotel, we immediately knew that we were in a nasty part of town. After all we had been through (a delayed flight, rain, and a late shuttle bus) all we wanted was a nice hotel room. When we stepped inside the hotel it looked charming enough, and the staff was kind. After checking in we walked to the elevator and what we witnessed was shocking, dirty air vents, peeling tile, peeling wallpaper, dust & debris everywhere. While stepping out of the elevator we encountered a nasty, dirty, dusty, and just plain unclean lobby. It looked as if a tornado of renovation (that had been there for 20 decades) went through it. Opening the door to our hotel room was like opening the gates to another",1,1
"Between the cockroaches and the disgusting smell coming from the shower curtain, the ultra dirty carpet and long hairs I found all over the comforter I thought I was on some hidden camera joke - This place is the worst I have ever stayed in 25 years of business travel.  The elevators were so dirty you wouldn't want to lean on the walls.  The only good thing was the people, they were very friendly.",1,1
I stayed at the Days Braodway for 5 nights at the begining of November 06.. The hotel is situated uptown and has nice resturants around it- its a little far out of time square (15-20 mins on the subway)..and away from the normal tourist places but i suppose it depends what you want out of you stay.. The hotel is having work done at the moment and looks very scruffy.. We asked for an renovated room- if what we had was newly removated then i would not like to see what the old rooms are like... The room was small and also its almost impossible to controll the temperature- either too warm or cold.. The lifts are horrid and look like they are going to break down. The carpets are scruffy. The maid changes sheets and towels daily although they dont vacume at all- not very good. Overall,2,1
"Really terrible.  I realize NYC is expense, but you can surely do better.",1,1
"This was our first trip to New York, and my daughter and I were very excited. The travel agent booked this hotel for us, but after reading the previous reviews  I was a bit hesitant about staying here, but thought hey it can't be too bad. Well, it was! Without a doubt it was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The room was old, dark and dingy, we had a lovely view of the alley. The bathroom old and gross. The hallway carpet was covered in bits of plaster, looked like it had been there a while. So much for housekeeping. If they can't keep a hallway clean then what does it say about the room cleaning standards. Actually we never felt 'clean' during our 4 day stay. The sheets were also old and thin. Apparently, they have been renovating for years. Didn't look like they achieved",1,1
"Being so excited about arriving in New York (three hours late, but we caught the Manhatten skyline all lit up, so not so bad) so we weren't wholly bothered about our hotel.  That was until we used the bathroom - it was FILTHY. The hot tap was hanging off and the plug was obviously having issues staying in the hole.  The room itself wasn't too bad, the bed was comfortable, and we were towards the back, so noise was at a minimum. We didn't have much of a view though, but that was mainly to do with the thick greasy film of dirt on the window. It was lovely and warm though as the hot water pipe ran down the wall next to the bed - not a great thing to use if you are unsteady in the morning as it was boiling hot.  Overall the location is great if you don't wan to stay in the middle of",2,1
"I paid $179 for one night for a two double bed room on the 11th floor. I wasn't expecting anything special, and i got what I expected. The hotel is just old and run down, plain and simple. The elevators can fit 3 people very tightly with one small carry-on style bag each. The elevator felt like it was going to break, and the door hardly shut. We got to the room and the carpet was very old and stained; to the point where you really didn't wanna take off your shoes. The beds were okay. They were clean. There was an old air conditioner hanging out the window. The air conditioner made a horrible noise throughout the night and never got cold. The seal around the window consisted of duct tape. I must say the bathroom looked decent, with marble countertop and a nice sink. The tub on",2,1
"This hotel has major cleanliness issues.  The location is good, close to transportation and restaurants, but bring your drain cleaner and some insect spray.  There are cigarette butts in the hallway (even though it's no smoking) the bathtub doesn't drain, and yes, insect and signs of rodents in the rooms.  Both window shades were broken, and the elevator didn't work.  Beware.",1,1
"i have got to say this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed in and i'm a travel agent, service appauling, decor absolutely shocking, loads of roaches in the room and hallway it was absolutely freezing, windows would not close and theer was mould everywhere having seen it was the quality hotel braodway i can understand why they changed the name to days hotel as a day is enough. please trust me do not stay here, it stinks",1,1
"Having read the reviews I wasn't expecting anything too great.  It was pretty much as expected.  The room was very small and cramped.  We had a double room instead of a twin room, which was not ideal.    We were on the 10th floor and should have had a good view but the window was so filthy that we could only just make out a vague outline of the building opposite.....  There was also thick dust above the bathroom door.  The sheets were clean but the shower had a mouldy ceiling and the bedroom carpet didn't fit.  Also the radiator hissed all night.  Luckily we spent very little time in the room and what we did spend there we were so exhausted we just crashed out.  Someone had left an old pie on the pipes ourside the lift on the tenth floor and it was there for the whole duration",2,1
"Disappointed. Arrived to be told that what we booked we could not have. No twin beds available despite being told there would be. Double would have to do. Told they would come back in two days to advise. They didnt bother. Windows need a good clean, but generally clean. Shower curtain stank terribly due to poor ventilation. Rest was average.",2,1
the cable tv was rubbish i couldnt watch monday nite raw. i got electric shocks of everything thing the lifts were atroucious i could go  on for days and days.,2,1
"Stayed in this hotel on 9-12 March and stayed on the 10th floor.  Room itself had seen better days and we could pick holes in it ie there was damp on the inside of the windows, noisy air conditioning, broken bath tap (still worked though!) etc but as a whole it was fine.  The room was clean on arrival and regularly cleaned every day.  The bed had crisp clean sheets and was very comfortable.  Some of the hotel staff were indifferent, others were very helpful and friendly.  The location of the hotel was a little away from most tourist attractions but at the price we paid I think it was only to be expected.  The hotel is located just by an underground station so a short trip and you can be in the heart of the city in no time.  However noise from traffic can be a problem if you are",2,1
"I stayed here on a year 12 school trip and when we arrived at the hotel it took up to 2 hours for us all to be assigned rooms, although we were ""lucky"" in that we got a room straight away, only to walk into it and smell the strongest, most stale cigarette smell despite it supposedly being a non-smoking room. Fortunately after complaining the staff were very polite and helpful and did in fact move us to another room although much better we found the lamp, hairdryer and toilet didn't work properly (the toilets actually became blocked in several people's rooms including ours.) All in all I would say that for what you pay and the location the hotel isn't bad but I certainly wouldn't stay there again.",2,1
"the hotel was ok if you wanted just a place to sleep at night which is what you want in new york but dats about all it offered. my college went there last year and in one room their was cockroachs, in another everything had static on it, another the tv was broken, another the toliet didnt flush....",2,1
"Im a student from the UK (wales) and we stayed at the days hotel (I wonder why it isnt called quality! anymore!) it was a school trip. at first everything was ok, wasnt too impressed as the lifts were broken and there didnt seem to be any smileing faces from the staff. the 1st nite there, room 825 our heating was broken, the lock to our door was hanging off, and the shower was falling apart, wen we turned on the water it was pooring out of the taps and the water wasnt going down the drain so the bath flooded with scolding hot water in a panic me and one other ran to the lobby and asked for help only to be yelled at behind the desk! ""you have a phone upstairs to call us so get bk up there and use it!"" we were shocked at this rudeness, no one showed up to help us for around 20",1,1
"My mother, aunt and I stayed in room 704 of this hotel this past weekend.  The roon we were given was completely unacceptable.  The room was hot, although it was only in the 20's and 30's at night, even though we ran the air conditioner all night.  There was an abundance of mold growing on the ceiling in the bathroom.  The carpeting by the window of the room was wet, frayed, dirty - gross.  We complained about the room but were told that another was not available.  The next afternoon, after a failed attempt to clean the mold, we were given another room that was better, but still not what I would consider adequate.  I would definitely not stay at this hotel again or recommend it to anyone.  I probably would not stay at any Days Inn anywhere because of this experience.",1,1
"I stayed at this hotel with my family and wish i had never booked to stay there it is the only hotel you wipe your feet on the way out!!!! it is basically filthy terrible staff only spoke english when money was involved, the heating was wrong the bed was filthty the bathroom you had to see it to belive it  the sprinkler system was jammed with paper, i could go on and on, but my travel agent refunded all of my money on return to the uk as the hotel would not answer their requests, my advice DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY OR STAY IN NEW YORK HERE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!ITS APAULING!!! I know they have changed the name of this dump but do not even go there take my advice.",1,1
"We stayed at this hotel in Jan and on arrival we were allocated a room (on the 9th floor) that was in a very poor condition, with obvious signs of wear and tear and with a terrible shower that would not work properly- temperature of the water could not be controlled and we struggled to turn the thing on and off. However upon request to reception they changed our room without question to one on the fifth floor and we were plesantly surprized! The room was clean and had obviously been updated. The bathroom facilities were modern, all worked really well (including the shower and hair-dryer) and the room was clean with adequate heating. Overall a budget hotel, in a great location- very near the subway, with a McDonalds close by and a 24 hour pharmacy on the corner. Great-considering",2,1
"we were very apprehensive about staying at the Days Inn after reading the reviews on this website so we prepared for the worst.  Upon arriving the reception staff to our surprise were not rude at all and in fact were very helpful. We were apparently given a refurbished room ( I hate to think what it looked like prior to refurbishment) which was better than expected.  We did have an alarm clock and the sheets were clean but we were a bit unsure about the top blankets.  The bath was ok but could have been cleaner and the floor definately looked like it could have done with a clean.  One word of advice is not to take your best white towel as once it has been taken by the cleaners along with all the other towels, you will not be able to get it back.   Also be careful with the lady",2,1
"I stayed here twice in November and the first time it was okay.  Nothing special but okay.  The second time I couldn't believe my eyes.  These comments all apply to my second stay.  It seems that it is pot luck at this hotel as some rooms are okay and others are truely awful.  I had read the reviews and decided that it would be okay as each stay was only one night and you can put up with anything for one night right?  Wrong.    The room was so small that it was difficult to simply get from the door to the bathroom. It smelled damp and musty but the bathroom was clean and everything worked.  There was no alarm clock, the phone was not able to be used as I had prepaid my accommodation.   The real problem started when I pulled back the bedspread to get into bed and I thought those",1,1
"This was formerly the Quality Inn, at west 94th street.  The location is the best thing going for this hotel, which appears to be a combination of several buildings.  The regular rooms do not have radio alarm clocks, and the oversized furniture actually cramps the rooms.  But the renovated baths are modern and the staff is helpful.  The rates are competitive for manhattan, especially if you can get one of the group discount rates such as aaa.",2,1
"I stayed in this hotel for 1 of the 4 nights I reserved(09/27/05). The sheets were filthy, the bathroom had bugs, the door didn't close all the way, the room did not come with the amenities it said it would (I.E. Cable. We barely got reception let alone HBO), no alarm clock.  This was vital to our stay since we were in town for a medical school interview. We had a light bulb out in our room so I went down to the front desk (our phone didn't work) and asked if someone could replace it. The desk staff called someone to change the bulb. A man walked in and said ""I ain't changing no lightbulbs. You do it."" Then walked out. Needless to say the light bulb was never replaced and there was no appology for the rudeness. I then asked if we could have a phonebook to look at. The man looked",1,1
"My reservation was moved to this hotel because the original hotel was still under construction.  The room was very basic.  It smelled like a damp dog, the air conditioner was loud, the hair dryer did not work, there is no fan in the bathroom, but it was bigger than my room at the W.  It cost me an extra $16 roundtrip in cabs to get to Midtown/Downtown because it was so far north.  But cute neighborhood & close to 96st. Subway station.",2,1
"After booking this hotel online and only having the briefest detail on it, I was somewhat nervous after having read the negative reviews on here.  I can only say I wished I'd heeded the majority advice and changed hotels.  It appears that the hotel has changed hands and become part of the Days Inn chain and boy, have they got some work to do.  The foyer is generally ok and check-in was swift although I wasn't happy to be told I couldn't use the room phone as I had pre-paid.  It meant all local & national calls had to be made using my mobile (cellphone) and as I'm from the UK, that has cost  me a bomb.  Why couldn't they take my credit card details like all other hotels do?  There are 2 sets of elevators: don't use the ones on the right of reception as they never seem to arrive.",2,1
"I stayed here November 2004.  The location is absolutely amazing, though the hotel is gross!  The elevators are scary and very slow.  The room was dirty, ie stains on walls, dirty carpet, mold in bathroom, etc.  The most disturbing part of the stay was seeing a cockroach climbing up the wall next to the bed.  When I booked the room online through the hotel website, it stated that local calls were free.  Well, they weren't.  I was charged for every call and by the minute.  When I got back home I e-mailed ""Choice Hotels"" customer service and I was refunded the money for all the local calls.  All that I can say is I believe all the negativity in the reviews I read!",1,1
"My Cousin, a friend and I booked to stay for 8 nights at this hotel and got what we thought was a bargain, when we 1st arrived we'd thought we had done okay as It seemed like a smart pleasant little hotel. The room seemed fine, apart from the room opposite which absolutley reeked of stale smoke and sweat, we think the room belonged to someone who worked there as the lock on the door was an old key lock. The shower leaked when we used it but apart from that for the 1st couple of days we thought things were okay. We was made aware we cpuldn't call out from our room as we had pre paid our room bill and they didn't want us running up a huge bill and not paying for it - which we thought was fare enough, but then when we tried to call into the hotel phone it kept getting diverted to",2,1
"Where do I start...? This Hotel is the worst I have ever stayed in. I had to request towels for the room as only one bathtowel was provided. The Bathroom in the room flooded. We moved to another room. Two nights later there was a mouse in the new room, which I killed in the bathroom and placed on the reception counter in a bag. The staff were ignorant and did not show any sign of concern for what happened. I checked out after the mouse incident and went to a Comfort Inn. Avoid this Hotel at all costs. It's a dump. I'd give it a no star rating. I’d rather sleep in the alleyways of Harlem than to spend another vacation in this Hotel. Under existing management it can only devolve to the status of brothel. DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1,1
"Book this hotel at your own risk!  My favorite part was when we left.  Not only is the staff unfriendly and incompetent, the hotel was under construction the entire time we were there and the place was a mess.  The last day there, the numbers on the doors were taken off so we didn't even know which rooms were ours.  We rented a rollaway bed and the front desk clerk charged me $479 for it instead of the $15 it should have cost.  When I brought this to their attention, there was no apology, as if this sort of thing happens quite often.  The rooms were small, the air conditioning didn't work, and there was a strange smell that we never could figure out.  Reading the prior reviews, I thought people were exagerating because the place couldn't be that bad....I was wrong, it was worse!",1,1
"My husband and I went to New York for our Honeymoon in April 05 for a week. We chose this hotel as the photos in the brochure looked lovely and it was reasonably priced. However, we now wish we'd paid a bit more and stayed somewhere else!! We arrived at the hotel and it was rather run down and tatty. Our first room (no 109) was tiny. We thought, 'ok we won't be here much' but when we ventured into the bathroom we found a large brown puddle in the middle of the floor which was formed from a dripping in the ceiling above (round the light fitting!) Needless to say, my husband called reception straight away and explained the situation and we asked to be moved to another room, which we did. I know this is a pretty cheap hotel, but I would not expect to be faced with this no matter",2,1
"Worst. Hotel. Ever. And I've stayed in some dumps in my uni years... The lobby was covered in building material, the staff were rude and unhelpful. We were trying to book flights for the next stage of our trip to chicago and no   one would help us locate the nearest travel agent. We ended up asking the concierge of another hotel.   The heating was broken, the room was so cramped you had to climb over the bed to get to the bathroom, the smell  in the halls and lifts were horrible. I;ll be going back to NYC many times in the future but never ever will I go near this hotel again.",1,1
"I visited with some friends on a 6th form college trip, our total number being 29, so we had alot of rooms, but the group were spread out over all floors.  When we first arrived our eyes were immediatly drawn to the 'danger' tape in the corner of the lobby where the plaster was falling off the ceiling. I hoped that things would get better, unfortunatly they did not. One of the lifts was out of order, so rather then wait around i choose to use the main stairs. These were fine till we reached 5th floor where there was all kinds of rubbish and cigarette ash along with flammable liquids with lids of ect.  My room was shared with 3 others yet only 3 keys were provided and only 3 sets f towels ect. The bed was not terrible but when i first arrived we had to remove the top cover and",1,1
We arrived here in Novemeber a day before my 21st birthday so anyone who has visited this hotel can sympathise on how i felt on my arrival First we sat in the so called lobby area which looked like something out of a scary film while the so called receptionist looked up our reservation....30 mins later we where taken to a room on the 10th floor....as we walked down the corridors the hotel stunk of smoke and mould...not inpressed with the room which had a leaking radiator ratteling windows and just smelt awfull we went back down 10 flights of STAIRS as i was too scared to go back in the lift due to its random juddring and floor stopping We where re located to a more acceptable room on the 4th floor (although the toilet did over flow twice and the showers heat was very,1,1
"We stayed here for a long weekend in December of 2004.  Upon our arrival we were greeted with a wonderful aroma of curry mixed with cigarette smoke which lingered through the entire building.  I was not impressed with the lobby area which scared me as typically what lies beyond that area isn't usually any more impressive.  We checked in (which was somewhat of a challenge since they had no record of our reservation which was confirmed twice prior to arrival) and entered the refrigerator sized elevator.  Once we got to our floor, we tried to make our way through the labyrinth of narrow hallways and misleading signs that led us in circles on the way to our room.  Our room was cramped to say the least, and looking out our window we were delighted to find an old sock sitting on our",1,1
"I stayed at the Quality Hotel on 94th Street and Broadway for a week in mid-february 2005 for 4 nights. The position of the hotel was excellent, close to the subway, convenience store and Central Park with some great places to eat nearby (I recommend the Key West Diner for breakfast). The towels and bed linen etc were changed daily and the lobby was also attractive and welcoming. HOWEVER, visiting the hotel as part of a group of 20, I had access to many rooms. To our astonishment when one room unlocked their door after we arrived there was a man asleep in the room. One room discovered several cockroaches, one girl's clothes were thrown away by the maid, the plug in my sink was stuck making it completely un-usuable and the radiator leaked onto the carpet. (With which the",2,1
"I just returned from a weekend trip to New York, we stayed 3 nights in the hotel and I really wouldn't recommend it to any one. When we arrived we had specified a non smoking room but the room we were allocated smelt like an old ashtray and the toilet was blocked,      when we complained the staff seemed slightly surprised but offered us an alternative room on the 12th floor which we accepted. This also stank of smoke but was ok once we opened a window. While moving our baggage we then got stuck in the lift for 10 minutes while it juddered between the 12th and 14th floors. The room was quiet but grubby(you wouldn't want to walk on the carpet in bare feet) and the shower filled the bath so you had to wait between showers although there was plenty of hot water. The communal area's",1,1
"Stayed at this hotel in December 2004 & after reading several ""concerning"" reviews our fears were confirmed on arrival. The staff were very unfriendly & unhelpful apart from one porter.  The room we were given smelt of cigarette smoke & was shabby & unclean.  The curtains were full of dust & hadn't been cleaned in ages & the bedding had cigarette burns in it. After staying in the room for just one night, my friend woke the next morning to find that she was not alone in her bed!  There was a cockroach in it!  We immediately telephoned reception & were told that someone would be up shortly.  After 20 minutes someone came up & took the cockroach away & didn't seem very concerned about what we had found.  We weren't offered another room & had to go to reception at 5.30 in the",1,1
"I read loads of bad reports about this hotel before we went to New York and was quite nervous about staying there.  However we were pleasantly surprised as it wasn't as bad we thought it was going to be.    The hotel is very old and desperatly in need of a makeover, however, the bed sheets were very clean as was the mattress, the towels were also very clean and both were changed daily.  The carpet and curtains in the room were very old and were quite dirty, so take your slippers to walk about in.  Having given most of the bad points, I found this a good base, we didn't spend much time there anyway.  A taxi down into the heart of New York only costs $10 or there is the subway right out on Broadway only a 2 minute walk away.  You must try the City Diner whilst you are there, the",2,1
"I read the reviews on this hotel the day before I travelled. I was really worried that my eagerly anticipated trip would be ruined.  To say I was pleasantly surprised would be way too generous but, it was not as bad as I had been led to believe. The room was on the 2nd floor so the lifts were no problem, although I preferred the stairs as the lifts looked like they would break down any second. The room itself was pitch black even during the day! This was due to the windows being obscured by polythene sheeting. It was very dark. The bathroom was light and clean, the towels were changed every day. More towels were requested and were left the next day. The beds were large and comfortable, the matresses were clean and the sheets were too. These were changed everyday. The floor was",2,1
I had the misfortune to stay at this grisily hotel in November for my 50th birthday.  This hotel was absolutely disgusting. This hotel was booked through a travel agent and was not a cheap package.  The rooms were nothing like advertised on the web they were very small with single beds.  The carpets were dirty as was everything else in the room.  I was also bitten on my arms and legs.  I had to sleep on bath towels because the beds were so dirty.  They left 2 plastic vending cups for coffe but I could not drink or eat anthing in that disgusting room.  To top all this off there were cockroches in this room.  All this made for a unhappy 50th birthday. DO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL.  It is hell.,1,1
"This is quite the worst hotel we've ever been allocated. The foyer is shabby, crammed with hampers of linen, decor well past it's best. The lift was disgusting, dirty and smelly. The room was not clean, stained windows, dirty and tattered curtains. The single seat was stained and unuseable, the room phone did not work and thebedding looked suspect. We stayed one night, sleeping fully dressed on top of the bed. Reception staff did not seem surprised at our departure. We are not fussy travellers, we wanted a basic room while we shopped,this hotel did not meet even our basic requirements of cleanliness and comfort.",1,1
"Personally would not stay there again. Did not feel 100% safe.  We may be too choosey however stayed there four nights (1 - 5 Dec) and found 3 cockroaches, one escaped capture... Room, well OK except alot of things were broken or kind of fixed. Corners of room had not seen a cleaner for several months. No hot water one morning. TV reception was poor.  Most things worked Ok however the room was very tired. I know NY is not cheap, however could have found a cheaper /  better hotel in London. Bellman was helpful and had a good sense of humour. Mexican food next door I would recommend. Subway very close on 96th. Good good places to eat breakfast close by. Overall just OK, but I would not stay there again.",2,1
"Guess they were renovating...parts of the room fine, others not so good.  Carpet was more like padding, mold around tub area.  Hall ways and elevators need sprucing up but location near the subway was great.  Better to stay nearer midtown if you're doing the tourist things.  Staff was helpful, esp. the bellmen.",2,1
"We started to worry at the smell of urine in the corridor on the way to our room.  It got worse when we killed the first cockroach on the bed.  The wallpaper was peeling, the room was generally grubby, and the blinds had to be kept shut at all times as the view was of other rooms. A request for a hairdryer was ignored for 30 minutes and then we were told there were none available.  We were not expecting much from a moderately priced hotel, but this was probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.",1,1
"We stayed here between 29 April and 4th May 2004 and to be honest when we arrived we were a little shocked and maybe expecting a little bit more, even though we only paid £399 each (inc flights). The hotel lobby is a complete dump and nothing like the carefully taken photo's on the website; there is some type of building work going on and a huge hole in the wall (maybe an old fireplace) was covered over with a sheet. The lifts are old, small and in need of an overhaul. We arrived at 12.30am after a long flight from the UK and were given room 413 and taken to the room by the security guard. Well, the room was nothing more than a dirty, disgusting bed sit. The bed was a put-you-up affair which had been roughly made, but not changed going by the biro scrawled all over the sheets.",2,1
"I did not check reviews before I booked this hotel and that was a mistake. A lot of the negative reviews I read, I experienced.  The room was abnormally small and did have a bad smell to it.  Our heater was spitting out water from the top and made a loud noise.  The best part of the room was the bathroom, which was very clean and it looked to have been remodeled.  I guess for the price it wasn't too bad.",2,1
"I stayed at this hotel for one month during a working trip to New York.  The hotel was very unclean, dusty and the bed clothing was stained and some times to small for the bed.  The room was small, and certainly the room shown on the internet does not mirror the real thing.  The only thing that was tidy and clean was the bathroom area, sometimes I often wondered what the floor was like to sleep on as an alternative to the bed that made me feel dirty.  I would encourage you shop for a better hotel !",1,1
Keep out one of the dirtiest I ever been in.Hotel is very smelly.  Furnitures are sticky probably no one cleans themcarpet is very dirty.  You open the window and you see old cigarete on the windows.  Great location but I had been in Newton hotel which is on the same block and it was a clean and cheaper hotel (rooms are smaller),1,1
"We paid a premium price here. The room was small and smelled like smoke. Some amenities you would expect, like a proper ice bucket, clean walls--were non-existant. All of this would be OK if it was cheap, but it was super expensive. Worse of all when you went into the bathroom at night there would be like 6-8 cockroaches scurrying about, with cockroach shells under the mirror. Yucko man.",2,1
"First off, when we arrived at the hotel there were not any available rooms so we had to wait in the very small lobby. When we got to our room, it was not bad for the money we paid. However, they do not use fitted sheets. When you wake up in the morning be prepared to find the mattress. The only other problem we had with the room was the water. If you want to make sure that you will have water, take your shower at night or early in the morning. Anytime between 9:00 and 11:00 in the morning you will not have ANY water.  Our other problems were with the people who were running the front desk. The bellhop was very nice and the security was nice, but the front desk people are very rude. They will take people in line out of order, so it does not really matter if you were there first",2,1
"This was horrible. The room smelled dirty, was dirty, and sooo small.  The whole place smelled like cigarettes. The whole room barely fit the bed and a TV, and there was no room to move! I definetly don't recommend it!! The location is definetly not close to anywhere either, for a tourist that is. It is in the residential areas of New York.",2,1
"Having read some of the reviews on here we were not expecting a great deal and balanced against the fact that it wasn't, by NYC's standards, expensive we thought 'what the heck?'. However we were still disappointed. Doesn't look too bad from the outside but the interior certainly requires a lick of paint and some air freshener here and there. The first room we were put in was tiny and oppressive. The windows faced into a courtyard(???) and so very little light shone into the room, (exacerbated by the lack of Windowlene applied to the glass) but the worst thing was the air handling unit on the adjacent roof that rattled and hummed virtually all the time. Getting to sleep was impossible. We asked to change rooms but were given some spurious excuse that this wouldn't be possible",2,1
"Having used this site prior to booking the hotel I wasn't expecting a huge amount - although neither was I expecting what I found.Personally, I won't be staying at the hotel again, on the day I was checking out, I discovered I hadn't been in the room alone, and noticed cockroaches on the floor. Other negative points for the hotel, small lifts, you can hear everything that's happening outside in the street (although I was only on the first floor), there were also cigarette burns in my bedding (odd for a non smoking room!?), the curtains and blinds were is desperate need of cleaning. Other than the cockroaches, all small things I know.If you are staying at the hotel - the subway (96th street) is located less than 60 seconds away, (1,2,3,9) and it's only two stops on the express",2,1
"Stayed in November 2003 ... was about all I could find for less than $300 a night that weekend! This hotel is fairly convenient ... being so close to Broadway ... about an $8.00 quick cab ride to the main theatre locations. Room was small and elevators way too small and slow.  Fortunately we were only on the fourth floor so made use of the well-worn marble stairs. But when we slipped off our shoes for the evening, we realized the entire carpet was soaking wet! Called the front desk ... they said it was the last non-smoking room available. So we had to put on shoes for every trip from the bed to the bathroom. The same desk clerk was on duty when we checked out ... she took 10% off our bill for the inconvenience. Learned my lesson ... if I'm going to NYC, I need to make a",2,1
"The room we had was dirty,smelly,and the bath leaked all over the floor.We swapped rooms but it was smaller only the shower was better.  The luggage handlers were great but thats all,i wouldnt let my cat sleep there.",1,1
"The staff on duty when we checked in was pleasant, and the room, although small, seemed adequate - until we discovered dirty sheets as we're getting into bed at 4am. Other room problems: a dirty coffee pot, cockroaches in the bathroom, multiple non-functioning electrical outlets, and what appeared to be pubic hair on supposedly clean towels.  The security lock on the door was broken. There was no functioning ice machine on our floor, nor the floor above or below. After check-in, the front desk seemed to be understaffed, unpleasant, and frequently did not answer the phone. They were not helpful with arranging transportation. The bed was comfortable, and the location is good, but find another place with clean sheets, and electricity.",1,1
One member of our party was very disappointed with the hotel but three of us found it adequate. It was clean and had the towels changed every day but it could certainly use a new coat of paint! In other words it was a bit shabby. As all we wanted to do there was sleep it was O.K.  The lifts were slow but at least they worked. Luckily the subway and Starbucks were just around the corner so the centre of New York was only minutes away. For a low cost visit to the Big Apple it was fine and I would probably stay there again. Doesn't look like the photo on the web-site.,2,1
"The hotel was the worst hotel I ever stayed in, the paint was peeling from the walls, curtains had big stains. I had to sleep in my clothes. Don't go there! I booked through priceline.",1,1
"There was nothing quality about the Quality Hotel Broadway. On arrival the first thing was the smell of unclean and the tatty appearance. But never mind I was there to do the marathon. There were men sat about drinking beer from cans which was a little off putting. The staff appeared bored and irritated by my presence. I had to climb over a beer drinking man who was on the floor propped up against the wall in the hall way smoking, who happened to be outside my room. On entering the room it smelt stale and unclean and the abstract pattern on the duvet was not a pattern, but was in fact hundreds of cigerette burns. There was no security as the lock had been busted off the door and was not repaired. on returning to reception with my obvious concerns the only question asked, or",1,1
"We went to the quality inn during august 2003. It was extrememly humid and hot and their air conditioning was broken. Elevators are so small that my closet in my hotel room was bigger. We had requested 1 bed, they gave us two. Room is EXTREMELY small, we barely had room to walk.  It was difficult to get tv channels, bathroom leaked, hotel staff rude and discourteous. While this hotel may seem like a bargain, go somewhere else! It's not worth it, even if you are trying to pinch a few pennies!",1,1
"This place seemed to have excellent reviews. Although the sheets appeared to be clean, the beds were barely made and there were blood splatters on the wall near the bed. The only nice part was that our shower had excellent water pressure. We changed hotels our second night in NYC.",2,1
"For a recent short trip to one of very favorite cities, my friend and I chose the Quality Hotel on Broadway, because we'd stayed there for 5 nights last year and had enjoyed the ease with which we'd reserved online (with option to cancel), the spacious room and adequate bathroom, the decent degree of cleanliness, the relative quietness, and, most of all, the convenient location (just a few feet from the 96 St. subway station) in a neighborhood we like. Unfortunately, the minusses outweighed the plusses during our recent two-night stay.Some of the same plusses were still there: the room was quiet, except for the slamming doors that so many hotels seem to have (and the clueless guests who let them slam), the bathroom looked as if it had been renovated recently (even though the",2,1
"On our very first visit to New York, we arrived in the dead of winter (snow and temperatures in the teens).  After 25 minutes at check-in, we ventured to our room.  After getting off the elevator, we were extremely surprised by the small hallways that led to the room.  The walls were very thin.  Once in the bitter cold room, my husband tried to figure out what the problem was with the heat.  Being from Texas, we were not use to seeing radiators in hotel rooms.  The front desk came to assist and check out the radiator problem and provided us with a portable heater.  Draped in our coats, gloves and other winter attire, we waited for the room to be heated. Eventually everything was working but after a long plane trip from Texas, we just weren't up to entering a room which wasn't",2,1
